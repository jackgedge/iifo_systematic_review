In addition, the high reported incidence of past suicide attempts by other methods is startling. In our sample, a remarkable 84 percent descnibed a history ofsuicide attempts, and most of these attempts occurred before imprisonment. Also common in this sample was psychosis. About three-quarters of the patients were judged by the psy chiatnic consultant to have bad corn mand hallucinations, suicidal idea tion, or both. In addition, the swat lowing ofantennae and toothbrushes can be construed as psychotic behav ion. Psychosis may have occurred in the setting of schizophrenia; almost a third of the sample had that diagnosis. No patient swallowed a foreign body before his first impnisonment. Desire to leave prison may explain this behavior, as may suicidal idea tion in response to incarceration. Sm cide pacts or copycat phenomena may contribute to foreign body in gestion in prison; two ofthe patients had shared a razor blade, each swal lowing half. All 19 patients ingested sharp or pointed objects, possibly be cause swallowing such objects is like ly to result in transfer from the prison to the hospital."

The most common duration from ingestion to the visit to the ER was within 24 hours (25/52 episodes). Most of the foreign objects were located in the esophagus (42.3%) and stomach (42.3%). The number of foreign objects was one in 28 episodes, two in 12 episodes and three or more in twelve episodes. The most common foreign objects were metal wires (26/52 episodes). The mean size of the foreign objects was 11.9 centimeters long. Successful endoscopic treatment was performed in most patients (46/52 episodes, 88.5%). The remaining six cases were treated surgically.","The foreign objects in prisoners were a variety of unusual things because of the prison environment, and endoscopy is a mainstay of treatment for foreign object removal in Korean prisoners."
