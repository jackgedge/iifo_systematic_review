\subsection*{Study Selection}

A total of 808 records were identified through initial database searches: PubMed (317), Web of Science (277), Google Scholar (135), Embase (25), SCOPUS (24), PsycINFO (16), and Cochrane (14).
316 duplicates were identified and removed.

Title and abstract screening was undertaken, with JGE reviewing all 492 records. A random sample of 50 records was generated for independent screening MS.
Cohen's Kappa was calculated for inter-reviewer agreement between JGE and MS, yielding a value of 0.38, indicating fair agreement.
Where JGE and MS disagreed, 16 records were reviewed by GC.
In total, 176 records were excluded, leaving 316 for full text review.

During full text review, JGE reviewed all 316 records. 
A random sample of 32 records was generated for independent review by MS. 
Inter-reviewer agreement was again calculated using Cohen's Kappa, yielding a value of 0.21, indicating fair agreement.   
Where JGE and MS disagreed, 5 records were reviewed by GC.   
In total, 276 records were excluded during full text review. 40 records were included and proceeded to bibliography search.  

The bibliographies of the 40 included papers were searched by manually JGE. Relevant bibliography items were identified, collated, and evaluated against the eligibility criteria, yielding 194 results.
These 194 results were reviewed by JGE. 164 bibliography search records were excluded, leaving 30 for inclusion. 

Therefore, a total of 70 records were included in this study and proceeded to bias assessment. This process is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:prisma}.
