That chest wounds occur frequently and are of considerable importance can be seen from Table I, which analyses the frequency and the fatality rates of chest injuries in the recent wars.

In forward areas the surgery of chest injuries is confined to emergency measures, such as the closing of sucking pneumothoraces and the relieving of tension pneumothoraces, etc., and is undertaken by the general surgeon, whilst the definitive surgery is performed by specialist surgeons at the base chest centres. Likewise, radiology in the forward areas is generally confined to scout films of the thorax, the special investigations being left to the radiologist at the special chest centres.

In modern warfare, the radiological investigation of a chest wound falls into two main classes:

(a) At Advanced Surgical Centres and C.C.S's

Films at this stage will generally be in the nature of scout films, to give a general estimation of the intra-thoracic damage. There is little place for complicated radiological examinations at this stage. Many of the patients are severely ill, often with multiple wounds, and as the portability of the apparatus (W.D. 85/15 unit) used of necessity limits its output, recourse to short distance technique must be made.

Using this technique, the anode film distance may be reduced to 30 in. or even less, to eliminate movement. The resulting distortion is no bar to correct interpretation as the lesion, unfortunately, is seldom minimal, whilst on the other hand the slightest movement may obscure even the most massive of lesions.",True,3.0,,,,,,,True,3.0

While Feeding They Transmit Important Diseases, Among Which ...","Amblyomma variegatum and Rhipicephalus appendiculatus are pests of domestic and to a certain extend wild animals. While feeding they transmit important diseases, among which are cowdriosis and East coast fever. It is generally known that pathogens after being ingested with the blood by the tick, move through the gut and reach the salivary gland where they are injected in a host with the saliva of the tick during feeding. Hardly anything is known on tick immune system. The goal of this work was to study the immune system of both A. variegatum and R. appendiculatus. Five types of haemocytes were found in both tick species. They were plasmatocytes, granulocytes, spherular cells, prohaemocytes and oenocytoids. There was no significant difference between total haemocyte count in adults and nymphs of A. variegatum and adults of R. appendiculatus. However total haemocyte count in infected ticks were significantly (P<0.05 ) higher than non-infected ones. Differential haemocyte count in non-infected showed a significant predominance of spherules and granular cells. The same trend was observed in ticks infected with bacteria. Tick haemocytes reacted to the presence of foreign bodies like bacteria, fungi and parasitoids by forming nodules or granulomma. All the ticks injected with Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana died within 5 to 10 days. None of the infected engorged females layed eggs. None of the engorged nymphs molted. Encapsulation was demonstrated using araldite as implant. Lysozyme activity was induced by injecting bacteria. Bacillus thuringiensis was observed to have induced more lysozyme activity than other bacteria. The tick parasitoid Ixodiphagus hookeri laid eggs in all the stages of both A. variegatum and R. appendiculatus but completed its development in the nymph of A. variegatum despite the cellular and humoral reactions of the host. The parasitoid goes through 3 larval stages, pupates, molt and emerges generally through one hole after 4 to 6 weeks post-infestation, leaving a dried empty cuticle.",True,4.0,,,,,,,True,4.0

Although No Data Have Been Reported To Support  A Relationship Between The Gag Reflex And Dysphagia, The Gag Reflex Is  Nevertheless Routinely Assessed During The Bedside Dysphagia Evaluation. The  Purpose Of The Present Study Was To Investigate Whether Absence Of A Gag Reflex  Is A Predictor Of Dysphagia. Method: Fourteen Consecutive Adult Subjects Referred  For A Bedside Dysphagia Evaluation Because They Were Considered To Be At  Increased Risk For Aspiration, Specifically Due To Absence Of A Gag Reflex, Were  Investigated. In Addition, The Gag Reflex Was Assessed In 69 Normal Adult  Volunteers. Results: Although All Subjects Were Referred For Bedside Dysphagia  Evaluations Specifically Because They Had No Gag Reflex, 86% (12/14) Were  Nevertheless Able To Eat At Least A Puree Diet. In Addition, 86% (12/14) Of  Subjects With No Gag Reflex Had Normal Velar Movement, Reinforcing The  Physiologic Differences Between Velar Functioning During Phonation And The Gag  Reflex. The Gag Reflex, Traditionally Considered Part Of The Bedside Dysphagia  Evaluation, Was Absent In 13% (9/69) Of Nondysphagic Subjects, Raising Further  Doubts Regarding Its Clinical Relevancy.

We examined an adult umbrella cockatoo (Cacatua alba) because of a 4-month history of weight loss and intermittent, dark brown, malodorous stool. Physical examination findings were unremarkable. Results of laboratory testing revealed anemia, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, monocytosis, hypoproteinemia, and hypoalbuminemia; blood lead and zinc concentrations were not elevated. Enterococcus durans was cultured aerobically from the feces. Gas-filled, dilated intestinal loops and a gas-filled proventriculus were evident on survey radiographs. The clinical signs did not resolve with initial treatment, which included ciprofloxacin, ketoconazole, and a lactobacillus supplement. Over the next 2 months, results of blood tests revealed nonregenerative anemia, intermittent leukocytosis, monocytosis, and hypoproteinemia. Staphylococcus lugdunensis and E faecium were isolated from a crop swab and fecal samples. A barium contrast study revealed a filling defect in the area of the large intestine, whereas results of fluoroscopy were normal. The cockatoo responded poorly to further treatment, including 5 days of supportive care in the hospital, and the owners requested euthanasia.

diseases, changed laws, and single-handedly launched the era of
antibiotics. This incredible discovery was sulfa, the first antibiotic. In The
Demon Under the Microscope, Thomas Hager chronicles the dramatic
history of the drug that shaped modern medicine.
Sulfa saved millions of livesamong them those of Winston Churchill and
Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr.but its real effects are even more far reaching.
Sulfa changed the way new drugs were developed, approved, and sold;
transformed the way doctors treated patients; and ushered in the era of modern
medicine. The very concept that chemicals created in a lab could cure disease
revolutionized medicine, taking it from the treatment of symptoms and
discomfort to the eradication of the root cause of illness.
A strange and colorful story, The Demon Under the Microscope illuminates the
vivid characters, corporate strategy, individual idealism, careful planning, lucky

Many Modalities Of Imf Have Been Described; Recently Imf Screws  Have Been Introduced Into Clinical Practice, However, Hardware Failure Can Occur.  We Performed A Retrospective Study Evaluating Hardware-Associated Complications  For Self-Drilling/Tapping Imf Screws. Materials And Methods: A Retrospective  Study On 49 Patients Requiring Imf Was Performed. The Diagnosis, Duration Of Imf,  Screw Site, Use Of Elastic Or Wire Fixation, And Associated Complications Were  Recorded. Imf Screws Were Used To Adjunct Open Reduction Techniques, For  Definitive Closed Reduction, Or Fracture Prevention Following Dentoalveolar  Surgery. Follow-Up Examinations Were Performed Until Fracture Healing Was  Complete (6 To 8 Weeks). Results: A Single Adverse Event Occurred In 19 Patients  (39%) While 4 Patients (8%) Had More Than 1 Complication. The Most Common Event  Was Screw Loosening; 29% Of Patients Had At Least 1 Screw Dislodged In The  Treatment Period. Of The Total Number Of Screws Placed (229), 15 (6.5%) Became  Loose, And Were Equally Distributed Among The Mandible And Maxilla. The Remaining  Complications Noted Were Root Fracture, 4% (2 Of 49); Loosened Wires, 6% (3 Of  49); Screw Shear, 2% (1 Of 49); Malocclusion, 2% (1 Of 49); And Ingested  Hardware, 2% (1 Of 49). Conclusions: Overall The Imf Self-Drilling/Tapping Screws  Have Been Shown To Be A Useful Modality To Establish Maxillomandibular Fixation.

It Brings Sophisticat Processes, Developing ...","For the growing number of critics concerned to trace the links among historical forces, psychic experience, and literary expression, the growth of trauma studies since the publication of Cathy Caruth's Unclaimed Experience (1996) offers an important opportunity for reflection. On one hand, the work in this field has been justly influential. It brings sophisticated psychoanalytic concepts to bear on collective processes, developing accounts of historical violence that are both socially specific and psychologically astute. These accounts are especially compelling when focused on what I call ""punctual"" traumas: historical events of such singularity, magnitude, and horror that they can be read as shocks that disable the psychic system. Thus, for example, in their readings of the Holocaust-the paradigmatic example for critics concerned with this kind of trauma-Caruth and others have helped us see how a historical moment might be experienced less as an ongoing set of processes that shape and are shaped by those living through them than as a punctual blow to the psyche that overwhelms its functioning, disables its defenses, and absents it from direct contact with the brutalizing event itself. Precisely because the violence suffered by Holocaust victims was so extreme, on this view, it affected those victims as a psychic concussion that short-circuited their capacity to ""process"" the traumatizing event as it took place. Traumas of this kind thus become accessible only in the mind's recursive attempts to master what it has in some sense failed to experience in the first instance. A punctual incursion on the mind, having ""dissociated"" consciousness from itself, installs an unprocessed memory-trace that returns unbidden, as delayed effect, in an effort to force the mind to digest this previously unclaimed kernel of experience.",True,5.0,,,,,,,True,5.0

Since Opioid Dependence Treatment With Naltrexone Tablets Suffers From High Dropout Rates, Several Depot Injections And Implants Are Under Investigation. Sustained‐Release Formulations Are Claimed To Be Effective, But A Systematic Review Of The Literature Is Lacking. Objectives To Evaluate The Effectiveness Of Sustained‐Release Naltrexone For Opioid Dependence And Its Adverse Effects In Different Study Populations. Search Methods The Following Databases Were Searched From Their Inception To November 2007: Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Lilacs, Psycinfo, Isi Web Of Science, Trial Database At Http://Clinicaltrials.Gov, Available Nida Monographs, Cpdd And Aaap Conference Proceedings. The Reference Lists Of Identified Studies, Published Reviews And Relevant Web Sides Were Searched Manually. Study Authors And Drug Companies Were Contacted To Obtain Any Unpublished Material Or Missing Data. Selection Criteria To Evaluate Effectiveness Only Rcts Were Included. To Evaluate Safety, Any Clinical Trial Reporting Adverse Effects Was Assessed. Treatment Condition Was Extended To Include Alcohol Dependent Subjects And Healthy Volunteers. Data Collection And Analysis Reviewers Independently Evaluated The Reports, Rated Methodological Quality And Extracted Data. Analyses Were Performed Separately For Opioid Dependent, Alcohol Dependent And Healthy Participants. Main Results Foe Effectiveness, One Report Met Inclusion Criteria. Two Dosages Of Naltrexone Depot Injections (192 And 384 Mg) Were Compared To Placebo. High‐Dose Significantly Increased Days In Treatment Compared To Placebo (Wmd 21.00, 95% Ci 10.68 To 31.32, P<0.0001). High‐Dose Compared To Low‐Dose Significantly Increased Days In Treatment (Wmd 12.00, 95% Ci 1.69 To 22.31, P=0.02). Number Of Patients Retained In Treatment Did Not Show Significant Differences Between Groups. For Adverse Effects, Seventeen Reports Met Inclusion Criteria Analyses, Six Were Rcts. Side Effects Were Significantly More Frequent In Naltrexone Depot Groups Compared To Placebo. In Alcohol Dependent Samples Only, Adverse Effects Appeared To Be Significantly More Frequent In The Low‐Dose Naltrexone Depot Groups Compared To Placebo (Rr 1.18, 95% Ci 1.02 To 1.36, P=0.02). In The Opioid Dependent Sample, Group Differences Were Not Statistically Significant. Reports On Systematic Assessment Of Side Effects And Adverse Events Were Scarce. Authors' Conclusions There Is Insufficient Evidence To Evaluate The Effectiveness Of Sustained‐Release Naltrexone For Treatment Of Opioid Dependence.  For Naltrexone Injections, Administration Site‐Related Adverse Effects Appear To Be Frequent, But Of Moderate Intensity And Time Limited. For A Harm‐Benefit Evaluation Of Naltrexone Implants, More Data On Side Effects And Adverse Events Are Needed. Plain Language Summary People With Opioid Dependence Require Substantial Therapeutic Effort To Keep Them Drug Free. Their Use Of Illicit Opioids Can Be Reduced And Retention In Treatment Improved With Supervised Agonist Replacement Therapy With Methadone, Which Is A Highly Addictive Drug. Naltrexone Is A Long‐Acting, Opioid‐Antagonist That Blocks Heroin Effects. It Is Used To Prevent Relapse Of Both Opioid And Alcohol Dependence. Highly Motivated People Do Best With  Naltrexone. Most Opioid Users Are Sceptical About Treatment With Naltrexone Tablets And Many Drop Out Early On. Dropouts Can Be Reduced With Supervised Tablet Taking, Offering Incentives And Using Sustained‐Release Naltrexone  Such As Subcutaneous Implants Or Depot Injections.  There Is Insufficient Evidence From Randomised Controlled Trials To Evaluate The Effectiveness Of Sustained‐Release Naltrexone. In The One Controlled Study That Met Inclusion Criteria, 60 Outpatients Were Randomised To One Of Three Groups That Received Two Sequential Depot Injections Of Naltrexone (192 Or 384 Mg) Or Placebo Injections. The Mean Dropout Time Was 48 Days With High Dose Naltrexone Compared With 27 Days On Placebo; An Increase In  Treatment Of 21 Days (Range 11 To 31 Days). The Lower Depot Dose Gave A Lesser Benefit. The Number Retained In Treatment At Eight Weeks Did Not Show A Clear Difference And Ranged From A Mean Of 68% To 39% Of Participants In  The Different Groups. 'Wanting Heroin' Did Not Differ On Naltrexone But 'Needing Heroin' Scored Significantly Lower With Depot Naltrexone Compared To Placebo. The Most Prominent Adverse Effects Were General Symptoms Of  Fatigue And Pain At The Injection Site. Seventeen Reports Met Inclusion Criteria For Assessing Adverse Effects. Seven Looked Specifically At Naltrexone Implants For Treatment Of Opioid Dependence And Wound Infection, Allergic Reaction To The Implant And Number Of Implants Removed. The Majority Of The Trials Did Not Have A Control Group And Systematic Assessment Of Adverse Effects Was Lacking.",,True,2.0,,,,,,,True,2.0

Thirty hospital inpatients with venous ulcers participated in this study for a treatment period of five weeks. They were divided randomly and equally into three groups (2 treatment groups and one control group). Patients in group (1) (HBOT group) received two 90 minutes treatments daily with 2 to3 L of humidified oxygen / minute at 22 mmHg. On the other hand, patients in group (2) (laser therapy group) received 1 J/cm2 infrared laser (Ga As), three times weekly. Patients in group (3) (control group) received standard wound care only. Wound surface area (WSA) and wound volume (WV) were used to measure the outcomes before starting the study and after the 3rd and 5th weeks posttreatment. It was found that, at the 5th week post-treatment there was a significant reduction in both WSA and WV in both the HBOT group and the laser therapy group when compared to the control group (P<0.0001), also there was a significant reduction in WSA and WV in the laser therapy group at the 5th week post-treatment when compared to the HBOT group (P<0.001). The findings strongly suggest that the application of infrared laser therapy at a dose of 1J/cm2, three times/week is more effective than the application of HBOT daily in the management of chronic venous ulcers.

This Review Discusses The Anaesthetic Potential Risks And Complications Observed  With Tattooing And Piercing, Their Management And Prevention. Recent Findings:  Airway Management During Anaesthesia Is Of Particular Interest With Oral Jewelry.  Patients Often Refuse To Remove Their Piercing For Fear Of Tract Closure. There  Are No Serious Complications Reported After Epidural Puncture Through A Tattoo,  Although Any Long-Term Consequence Cannot Be Discarded Yet. Even Theoretical  Concerns Are More And More Debated. Summary: Oral And Nasal Piercing Is Of  Particular Concern Because Of The Risks Of Swallowing And Aspiration.  Consequently, Patients Should Be Advised To Remove Piercing Before Anaesthesia.  Emergency Situations Are Especially Risky And Anaesthesiologists Should Be Aware  Of The Piercing Removal Techniques. In Case Of Piercing Loss, Radiographies And  Fiberoptic Endoscopy Of The Upper Airways And Digestive Tracts Should Be  Performed To Eliminate Aspiration Or Swallowing Of The Foreign Body.

Current Literature Lacks Good  Data Documenting Long-Term Outcomes In Children. This Makes It Difficult To  Counsel Some Patients About Realistic Treatment Expectations. The Objective Of  This Study Is To Evaluate Our Institutional Experience And Define The Natural  History And Treatment Outcomes. Methods: A Retrospective Review Of Clinical Data  Obtained From Children Who Underwent Dilation For Ps Was Performed. Results: Over  The Past 30 Years, 114 Children And Adolescents Received 486 Dilations. The Most  Common Indications For Stricture Dilation Were Ps (42%) And Esophageal Atresia  (38%). Other Lesser Indications Included Congenital, Foreign Body, Corrosive,  Cancer, Radiation, Allergic, And Infectious. This Review Focuses On The 48  Children With Ps. Of The Children With Ps, A Congenital Anomaly Was Identified In  23 Children; And 12 Had Neurologic Impairment. Average Age At Presentation Was  10.2 Years (Range, 0.5-18.3 Years). Most Patients Had Had Symptoms For Many  Months Before Diagnosis. Peptic Stricture Was Most Common In The Lower Esophagus  (N = 39). However, Middle (N = 8) And Upper (N = 1) Strictures Were Occasionally  Identified. Noncompliance With Medical Therapy Was A Challenge In 12% (N = 5) Of  Children. Children With A Ps Received A Median Of 3 Dilations, But A Subset Of 5  Patients With Severe Strictures Underwent Up To 48 Dilations (Range, 1-48).  Repeated Dilations Were Required For A Median Of 20 Months (Range, 1-242 Months).  Among Patients Receiving Esophageal Dilation For Ps, 94% Required An Antireflux  Procedure (19% Required A Second Antireflux Surgery). A Subgroup Of Patients (N =  10) Was Identified Who Required Extended Dilations, Multiple Surgeries, And  Esophageal Resection. This Subgroup Had A Significantly Longer Period Of  Symptomatic Disease And Increased Risk Of Esophageal Resection Compared With  Those Patients Requiring Fewer Dilations. Surgical Resection Of The Esophageal  Stricture Was Ultimately Required In 3 Children With Ps After Failure Of More  Conservative Measures. Conclusion: Children And Adolescents Presenting With  Reflux Esophageal Stricture (Ps) Frequently Require Antireflux Surgery, Redo  Antireflux Surgery, And Multiple Dilations For Recurrent Symptoms.

Common malignancies in renal transplant recipients are non melanoma skin cancer, Kaposi sarcoma and non-hodgkin lymphoma with a 20 fold increase in their risk. Renal cell carcinoma in native kidneys after renal transplant is quite infrequent (0.3-4.8%). Here we report first case of renal cell carcinoma originating in native kidney, diagnosed by EUS guided FNA. Case Description: A 54-year-old gentleman status post renal transplant secondary to Goodpastures syndrome presented with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. His past medical history include hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. Early investigations included a liver battery, amylase, lipase; CBC and a basic metabolic panel were found negative. A right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed normal liver and gallbladder, however, cyst was found in an enlarged right native kidney. MRI of the abdomen showed retroperitoneal lymph nodes concerning for lymphoma along with enlargement of the right native kidney with irregular borders concerning for neoplasm. He then underwent endoscopic ultrasound to evaluate the perigastric/peripancreatic area for possible fine-needle aspiration of lymph nodes. The endosonographic examination revealed multiple lymph nodes at sub-carinal, paraesophageal, celiac axis, peripancreatic and periduodenal areas. Small-to-moderate amount of ascites was identified. Using a 25-gauge needle, fine-needle aspiration was performed from mediatsinal lymph nodes, celiac lymph nodes and peripancreatic lymph nodes. Ascetic fluid was then aspirated using a 19-gauge needle under endosonographic guidance. Cytopathology of the lymph node and ascetic fluid samples revealed metastatic renal cell carcinoma. PET scan confirmed it by lighting up in right kidney and other areas of metastatic lymphadenopathy. Conclusion: In conclusion, EUS guided FNA could have an important role in identifying the primary source of metastatic lymphadenopathy in renal transplant patients. It is safe, minimally invasive, feasible and highly accurate in making such diagnosis and assisting further management.",True,2.0,,,,,,,True,2.0

Thought it is a rare form of skin cancer there are about 160,000 new cases of melanoma yearly worldwide. More than 53,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with melanoma every year. It is currently the fastest growing cancer, both in the U.S. and worldwide. We present a case of a patient with metastatic malignant melanoma presenting as an infiltrating mass into the duodenum from the retroperitoneal space. A 77 year old male presented with fatigue and weight loss over the course of the preceding several months. The patient's past medical history was only significant for hyperlipidemia and BPH. The patient states that he has lost 40 lbs over the previous 1-2 months prior to admission. Physical exam was benign except for a palpable mass and guaiac testing was positive. The patient had a CT scan which demonstrated large complex lobulated mass in the sub-hepatic space measuring approximately 14.7 _ 14.1 _ 10.8 cm. The patient's labs demonstrated hemoglobin of 7.9, and the patient was transfused and taken for upper endoscopy. On esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) neoplastic lesions were noted to infiltrate the dudodenal bulb. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration demonstrated a hetergoenous mass with both hypo/hyperechoic features. The biopsy showed malignant cells most in architecture to melanoma. Immuno-histochemical studies performed on the cell block demonstrated positive staining of the tumor cells for vimentin, HMB45, melan-A, and focally for S100. Stains for mixed cytokeratins, smooth muscle actin, and CD34 are negative in the tumor cells. The final diagnosis of malignant melanoma was subsequently made. The patient was referred for surgical evaluation. Metastatic retroperitoneal lesions resulting from melanoma is an extremely rare finding and EUS-FNA is a novel method for diagnosing metastatic lesions. EUS-FNA has been shown to be a safe and reliable modality for obtaining definitive histological diagnosis. When it is compared with the traditional diagnostic modalities, it is not only more accurate than imaging studies such as computerized tomography, positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, but it is also a very safe procedure with fewer complications than transcutaneous biopsies. Clinicians should be aware of this imaging modality and consider its employment when applicable.",True,2.0,,,,,,,True,2.0

Several Brands Of These  Expanding Wood Glues (Those Containing Diphenylmethane Diisocyanate [Mdi]) Have  The Potential To Form Gastrointestinal (Gi) Foreign Bodies If Ingested. The  Ingested Adhesive Forms An Expanding Ball Of Glue In The Esophagus And Gastric  Lumen. This Expansion Is Caused By A Polymerization Reaction Using The Heat,  Water, And Gastric Acids Of The Stomach. A Firm Mass Is Created That Can Be 4-8  Times Its Original Volume. As Little As 2 Oz Of Glue Have Been Reported To  Develop Gastric Foreign Bodies. The Obstructive Mass Is Reported To Form Within  Minutes Of Ingestion Of The Adhesive. The Foreign Body Can Lead To Esophageal  Impaction And Obstruction, Airway Obstruction, Gastric Outflow Obstruction,  Mucosal Hemorrhage, Ulceration, Laceration, Perforation Of The Esophageal And  Gastric Linings, And Death. Clinical Signs Following Ingestion Include Anorexia,  Lethargy, Vomiting, Tachypnea, And Abdominal Distention And Pain, And Typically  Develop Within 12 Hours. Clinical Signs May Depend Upon The Size Of The Mass. If  Left Untreated, Perforation And Rupture Of The Esophagus Or Stomach Can Occur.  The Glue Mass Does Not Stick To The Gi Mucosa And Is Not Always Detectable On  Abdominal Palpation. Radiographs Are Recommended To Confirm The Presence Of The  ""Glue-Ball"" Foreign Body, And Radiographic Evidence Of The Obstruction May Be  Seen As Early As 4-6 Hours Following Ingestion. Emesis Is Contraindicated Owing  To The Risk Of Aspiration Of The Glue Into The Respiratory Tree Or The Subsequent  Lodging Of The Expanding Glue Mass In The Esophagus.

Mandibular Fractures May Be Treated Using Open (Surgical) And Closed (Non‐Surgical) Techniques. Fracture Sites Are Immobilized With Intermaxillary Fixation (Imf) Or Other External Or Internal Devices (I.E. Plates And Screws) To Allow Bone Healing. Various Techniques Have Been Used, However Uncertainty Exists With Respect To The Specific Indications For Each Approach. Objectives The Objective Of This Review Is To Provide Reliable Evidence Of The Effects Of Any Interventions Either Open (Surgical) Or Closed (Non‐Surgical) That Can Be Used In The Management Of Mandibular Fractures, Excluding The Condyles, In Adult Patients. Search Methods We Searched The Following Electronic Databases: The Cochrane Oral Health Group'S Trials Register (To 28 February 2013), The Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials (Central) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 1), Medline Via Ovid (1950 To 28 February 2013), Embase Via Ovid (1980 To 28 February 2013),  Meta Register Of Controlled Trials (To 7 April 2013), Clinicaltrials.Gov (To 7 April 2013) And The Who International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (To 7 April 2013). The Reference Lists Of All Trials Identified Were Checked For Further Studies. There Were No Restrictions Regarding Language Or Date Of Publication. Selection Criteria Randomised Controlled Trials Evaluating The Management Of Mandibular Fractures Without Condylar Involvement. Any Studies That Compared Different Treatment Approaches Were Included. Data Collection And Analysis At Least Two Review Authors Independently Assessed Trial Quality And Extracted Data. Results Were To Be Expressed As Random‐Effects Models Using Mean Differences For Continuous Outcomes And Risk Ratios For Dichotomous Outcomes With 95% Confidence Intervals. Heterogeneity Was To Be Investigated To Include Both Clinical And Methodological Factors. Main Results Twelve Studies, Assessed As High (Six) And Unclear (Six) Risk Of Bias, Comprising 689 Participants (830 Fractures), Were Included. Interventions Examined Different Plate Materials And Morphology; Use Of One Or Two Lag Screws; Microplate Versus Miniplate; Early And Delayed Mobilization; Eyelet Wires Versus Rapid Imf™ And The Management Of Angle Fractures With Intraoral Access Alone Or Combined With A Transbuccal Approach. Patient‐Oriented Outcomes Were Largely Ignored And Post‐Operative Pain Scores Were Inadequately Reported. Unfortunately, Only One Or Two Trials With Small Sample Sizes Were Conducted For Each Comparison And Outcome. Our Results And Conclusions Should Therefore Be Interpreted With Caution. We Were Able To Pool The Results For Two Comparisons Assessing One Outcome. Pooled Data From Two Studies Comparing Two Miniplates Versus One Miniplate Revealed No Significant Difference In The Risk Of Post‐Operative Infection Of Surgical Site (Risk Ratio (Rr) 1.32, 95% Ci 0.41 To 4.22, P = 0.64, I 2  = 0%). Similarly, No Difference In Post‐Operative Infection Between The Use Of Two 3‐Dimensional (3D) And Standard (2D) Miniplates Was Determined (Rr 1.26, 95% Ci 0.19 To 8.13, P = 0.81, I 2  = 27%). The Included Studies Involved A Small Number Of Participants With A Low Number Of Events. Authors' Conclusions This Review Illustrates That There Is Currently Inadequate Evidence To Support The Effectiveness Of A Single Approach In The Management Of Mandibular Fractures Without Condylar Involvement. The Lack Of High Quality Evidence May Be Explained By Clinical Diversity, Variability In Assessment Tools Used And Difficulty In Grading Outcomes With Existing Measurement Tools. Until High Level Evidence Is Available, Treatment Decisions Should Continue To Be Based On The Clinician'S Prior Experience And The Individual Circumstances. Plain Language Summary Treatments For Fractures Of The Lower Jaw Review Question The Lower Jaw (Also Known As The Mandible) Is An Important Bone That Shapes The Face, Holds The Lower Teeth In Place And Is Used To Move The Mouth, For Talking And Chewing Food. Fractures Are Most Often Found In The Part Of The Lower Jaw That Supports Teeth (Known As The Body), The Part Where The Jaw Curves Upwards Into The Neck (The Angle), Or At The Knobbly‐Shaped Joint Found At The Very Top Of The Jaw Bone (The Condyle). Available Treatments Align And Stabilize The Fracture, Allowing The Bone To Heal In The Proper Position. Treatments May Or May Not Involve Surgery. This Review, Produced By The Cochrane Oral Health Group, Examines Different Methods For Treating Fractures Of The Body And Angle Of The Mandible In Existing Research And Studies. Background People Of All Ages Can Fracture Their Lower Jaw, But Fractures Mainly Occur As A Result Of Violence (For Example, Being Hit Or Punched In The Jaw) Or By Being Involved In An Accident On The Road (For Example, Car Crashes Or Bicycle Accidents). These Fractures Can Be Stabilized By Physically Binding The Jaw Shut With A System Of Bars, Wires Or Elastic Bands (Intermaxillary Fixation), Or By Using Tiny Screws Or Plates Attached Directly To The Fractured Sections Of The Lower Jaw Bone Whilst Still Allowing The Mouth To Open (Rigid Fixation). Study Characteristics The Evidence On Which This Review Is Based Is Up To Date As Of 28 February 2013. Twelve Studies With A Combined Total Of 689 Participants Were Included In This Review. Participants Ranged In Age From 16 To 68 Years And Most Participants (90%) Were Male. All Of The Studies Compared Different Types Of Surgical Treatments, And Each Study Evaluated A Different Aspect Of Surgical Treatment Such As Different Types Of Plates, Screws, Or Wires Or How Long The Jaw Was Immobilized After Surgery. Key Results There Were Concerns About The Design And Quality Of All The Studies. All The Studies Evaluated Different Aspects Of Surgical Treatment. None Of The Studies Evaluated Non‐Surgical Treatments Such As Intermaxillary Fixation And No Study Compared Surgical Treatment With Non‐Surgical Treatment. As A Result There Is No Clear Evidence To Indicate Which Approach Is The Best To Manage These Fractures. Quality Of The Evidence The Quality Of The Evidence Found Is Poor.

Although There Are Many Kinds Of Interventions, The Optimal One For The Palliation Of Dysphagia Remains Unclear. This Review Updates The Previous Version Published In 2009. Objectives The Aim Of This Review Was To Systematically Analyse And Summarise The Efficacy Of Different Interventions Used In The Palliation Of Dysphagia In Primary Oesophageal And Gastro‐Oesophageal Carcinoma. Search Methods To Find New Studies For This Updated Review, In January 2014 We Searched, According To The Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal And Pancreatic Diseases Model, The Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials (Central) ( The Cochrane Library ), Medline, Embase And Cinahl; And Major Conference Proceedings (Up To January 2014).   Selection Criteria Only Randomised Controlled Trials (Rcts) Were Included In Which Patients With Inoperable Or Unresectable Primary Oesophageal Cancer Underwent Palliative Treatment. Different Interventions Like Rigid Plastic Intubation, Self‐Expanding Metallic Stent (Sems) Insertion, Brachytherapy, External Beam Radiotherapy, Chemotherapy, Oesophageal Bypass Surgery, Chemical And Thermal Ablation Therapy, Either Head‐To‐Head Or In Combination, Were Included. The Primary Outcome Was Dysphagia Improvement. Secondary Outcomes Included Recurrent Dysphagia, Technical Success, Procedure Related Mortality, 30‐Day Mortality, Adverse Effects And Quality Of Life. Data Collection And Analysis Data Collection And Analysis Were Performed In Accordance With The Methods Of The Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal And Pancreatic Diseases Review Group. Main Results We Included 3684 Patients From 53 Studies. Sems Insertion Was Safer And More Effective Than Plastic Tube Insertion. Thermal And Chemical Ablative Therapy Provided Comparable Dysphagia Palliation But Had An Increased Requirement For Re‐Interventions And For Adverse Effects. Anti‐Reflux Stents Provided Comparable Dysphagia Palliation To Conventional Metal Stents. Some Anti‐Reflux Stents Might Have Reduced Gastro‐Oesophageal Reflux And Complications. Newly‐Designed Double‐Layered Nitinol (Niti‐S) Stents Were Preferable Due To Longer Survival Time And Fewer Complications Compared To Simple Niti‐S Stents. Brachytherapy Might Be A Suitable Alternative To Sems In Providing A Survival Advantage And Possibly A Better Quality Of Life, And Might Provide Better Results When Combined With Argon Plasma Coagulation Or External Beam Radiation Therapy. Authors' Conclusions Self‐Expanding Metal Stent Insertion Is Safe, Effective And Quicker In Palliating Dysphagia Compared To Other Modalities. However, High‐Dose Intraluminal Brachytherapy Is A Suitable Alternative And Might Provide Additional Survival Benefit With A Better Quality Of Life. Some Anti‐Reflux Stents And Newly‐Designed Stents Lead To Longer Survival And Fewer Complications Compared To Conventional Stents. Combinations Of Brachytherapy With Self‐Expanding Metal Stent Insertion Or Radiotherapy Are Preferable Due To The Reduced Requirement For Re‐Interventions. Rigid Plastic Tube Insertion, Dilatation Alone Or In Combination With Other Modalities, And Chemotherapy Alone Are Not Recommended For Palliation Of Dysphagia Due To A High Incidence Of Delayed Complications And Recurrent Dysphagia.

However, The Optimal Palliative Technique For Dysphagia Improvement And Better Quality Of Life Is Not Established. Background Dysphagia (Difficulty Or Discomfort In Swallowing) Is Common Among Patients With Unresectable Or Inoperable Oesophageal Cancer. There Are Five Levels Of Dysphagia, Ranging From The Ability To Eat A Normal Diet To Some Solids, Semisolids, Liquids And To Complete Dysphagia. Study Characteristics The Review Included Randomised Controlled Studies Comparing The Use Of Different Interventions To Improve Dysphagia Among Patients With Inoperable Or Unresectable Primary Oesophageal Cancer. To Find New Studies For This Updated Review, In January 2014 We Searched, According To The Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal And Pancreatic Diseases Model, The Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials (Central) ( The Cochrane Library ), Medline, Embase And Cinahl; And Major Conference Proceedings (Up To January 2014). Key Results The Review Updates The Previous Version But Still Fails To Present Any Obvious Superiority Of One Technique Over Another Among The Different Kinds Of Interventions. Self‐Expanding Metal Stents Provided Safer And More Effective Relief Of Dysphagia Compared To Rigid Plastic Stents. Other Techniques Like Radiotherapy Or Brachytherapy Were Also Suitable Alternatives And Might Be Favourable In Improving Quality Of Life And Prolonging Survival. Individual Differences Should Be Emphasised When The Intervention Type Was Determined. Quality Of The Evidence Half Of The Studies Included In This Review Were Of High Quality.

In Trials With An Overall Low Risk Of Bias, A High Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen Compared With A Routine Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen Was Not Associated With All‐Cause Mortality (Random‐Effects Model: Rr 1.12, 95% Confidence Interval (Ci) 0.93 To 1.36; Grade: Low Quality) Within The Longest Follow‐Up And Within 30 Days Of Follow‐Up (Peto Odds Ratio (Or) 0.99, 95% Ci 0.61 To 1.60; Grade: Low Quality). In A Trial Sequential Analysis, The Required Information Size Was Not Reached And The Analysis Could Not Refute A 20% Increase In Mortality. Similarly, When All Trials Were Included, A High Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen Was Not Associated With All���Cause Mortality To The Longest Follow‐Up (Rr 1.07, 95% Ci 0.87 To 1.33) Or Within 30 Days Of Follow‐Up (Peto Or 0.83, 95% Ci 0.54 To 1.29), Both Of Very Low Quality According To Grade. Neither Was A High Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen Associated With The Risk Of Surgical Site Infection In Trials With Low Risk Of Bias (Rr 0.86, 95% Ci 0.63 To 1.17; Grade: Low Quality) Or In All Trials (Rr 0.87, 95% Ci 0.71 To 1.07; Grade: Low Quality). A High Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen Was Not Associated With Respiratory Insufficiency (Rr 1.25, 95% Ci 0.79 To 1.99), Serious Adverse Events (Rr 0.96, 95% Ci 0.65 To 1.43) Or Length Of Stay (Mean Difference ‐0.06 Days, 95% Ci ‐0.44 To 0.32 Days). In Subgroup Analyses Of Nine Trials Using Preoperative Antibiotics, A High Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen Was Associated With A Decrease In Surgical Site Infections (Rr 0.76, 95% Ci 0.60 To 0.97; Grade: Very Low Quality); A Similar Effect Was Noted In The Five Trials Adequately Blinded For The Outcome Assessment (Rr 0.79, 95% Ci 0.66 To 0.96; Grade: Very Low Quality). We Did Not Observe An Effect Of A High Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen On Surgical Site Infections In Any Other Subgroup Analyses. Authors' Conclusions As The Risk Of Adverse Events, Including Mortality, May Be Increased By A Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen Of 60% Or Higher, And As Robust Evidence Is Lacking For A Beneficial Effect Of A Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen Of 60% Or Higher On Surgical Site Infection, Our Overall Results Suggest That Evidence Is Insufficient To Support The Routine Use Of A High Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen During Anaesthesia And Surgery. Given The Risk Of Attrition And Outcome Reporting Bias, As Well As Other Weaknesses In The Available Evidence, Further Randomized Clinical Trials With Low Risk Of Bias In All Bias Domains, Including A Large Sample Size And Long‐Term Follow‐Up, Are Warranted. Plain Language Summary The Effects Of Giving Adult Patients A High Inspiratory Oxygen Fraction Around The Time Of Surgery Review Question The Normal Air That We Breathe Contains 21% Oxygen. This Systematic Review Assesses The Beneficial And Harmful Effects Of A Percentage Of Inspired Oxygen Of 60% To 90% Compared With A Routine Percentage Of 30% To 40% Given During Anaesthesia, During Surgery And In The Immediate Recovery Period On The Numbers Of Deaths And Surgical Site Infections Reported In Adult Surgical Patients. Background Reduced Lung And Circulatory Function During Surgery Can Lead To Reduced Levels Of Oxygen (Hypoxia). Also, Oxygen Levels Are Often Low In Wounds At The End Of Surgery. This May Impair Bacterial Killing And Wound Healing. Trials And Previous Meta‐Analyses Have Led To Different Conclusions As To Whether A High Percentage Of Inspired Oxygen During Anaesthesia May Decrease Or Increase The Risk Of Death Or Surgical Site Infections. This Systematic Review Used Improved Cochrane Methodology For Carrying Out Systematic Reviews To Reassess Available Evidence Derived From Randomized Clinical Trials. Study Characteristics We Identified 28 Randomized Clinical Trials. Eight Trials With 4918 Participants Reported On Risk Of Death, And 15 Trials With 7219 Participants Reported On Surgical Site Infections Within 14 To 30 Days Of Surgery. Four Trials Reported Serious Adverse Events, Three Trials Respiratory Insufficiency, Nine Trials Length Of Stay During The Associated Hospital Admission And One Trial Quality Of Life. All Trials Were Conducted Without Direct Industry Funding. The Number Of Participants In Each Trial Ranged From 38 To 2012. The Mean Age Of Participants Was 50 Years (Range 15 To 92 Years) And 63% Were Women. Types Of Surgery Included Abdominal Surgery (Eight Trials), Caesarean Section (Four Trials), Breast Surgery (One Trial), Orthopaedic Surgery (Two Trials) And Various Other Surgical Procedures (Four Trials). Key Results A High Percentage Of Inspired Oxygen Was Not Statistically Associated With Increased Risk Of Death, Or With A Decrease In Surgical Site Infections, In All Trials That Measured These Outcomes, In Trials Of Highest Quality And In Those With Longest Follow‐Up. An Increased Risk Of Adverse Events Could Not Be Proved Right Or Wrong For A High Percentage Of Inspired Oxygen During Anaesthesia And Surgery. Quality And Quantity Of The Evidence Only Five Of The Included Trials Had Low Risk Of Bias. The Trials Randomly Assigned 9330 Participants, Of Whom Only 7537 Participants Provided Data For This Review. The Number Of Participants Required To Detect Or Reject A 20% Relative Risk Reduction In Deaths Was Not Reached; Therefore The Observed Results Were Uncertain.",,True,2.0,,,,,,,True,2.0

Important contributions in surgical instruments come up readily in a review of his work, contradicting the view some have maintained of him as a mere compiler. He was a true inventor, creating many surgical instruments that were not known in the Greco-Roman era. Quite early, he produced contributions influencing surgical procedures in Europe from the 14th to the 18th centuries.

Their diminished faith in the surety of sanitary surveillance was linked directly to the widespread perception that Eastern European, primarily Jewish, immigrants and transmigrant (en route to America), were the prime conduits of the disease. Temporary measures were aimed directly at the migrants and appeared to contradict the long-standing assertions of antiquarantinists.

Background Gastrointestinal Bleeding Refers To Loss Of Blood From Any Site Of The Digestive Tract. If The Bleeding Site Is Near The Ligament Of Treitz (The Muscle Extending From The Junction Of The Duodenum And Jejunum To The Diaphragm), It Is Described As Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding. If The Bleeding Site Is Away From The Ligament Of Treitz, It Is Described As Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding. People With A Small Amount Of Blood Loss May Have No Symptoms, And Have Bloody Vomiting Or See Blood In The Stool With Increased Bleeding. Chronic Mild Gastrointestinal Bleeding Can Lead To Anaemia, Causing Fatigue Or Pallor; Acute Massive Gastrointestinal Bleeding Can Be Life‐Threatening. Gastrointestinal Bleeding Has Two Scenarios In Children. The First Is A Complaint Of Attending The Emergency Department As A Symptom Of Diseases Such As Ulcers, Gastritis, Mallory‐Weiss Tears, Anorectal Fissures, Allergic Colitis, Infectious Colitis, Intussusception, Henoch‐Schonlein Purpura, And Meckel'S Diverticulum.

The trial was a prospective, controlled, randomized two-arm study evaluating the efficacy of a bioelectric dressing, Procellera, applied topically two to three times per week for 2 weeks to blisters developed in Ranger trainees during training at Fort Benning, Georgia. A total of 80 US Army Ranger recruits with blister wounds below the knee were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (n = 40/group). The primary goal was to assess the clinical efficacy (rate of healing) of administered Procellera in conjunction with the standard-of-care (SOC) treatment, moleskin and Tegaderm , on the healing rate of blisters compared with the SOC treatment alone. The secondary end points for efficacy were the quantities of wound fluid biomarkers and bacterial bioburden. The tertiary end point was assessment of pain in the treatment group compared with that of the control group during the 2-week study. The results showed no statistical difference between the SOC and SOC+Procellera groups in wound healing and pain. Wound fluid was reported for 24 participants (64.9%) in the SOC group and 21 participants (56.8%) in SOC+Procellera group at the baseline measurement (_ = .475); however, the wounds were devoid of fluid on follow-up visits. The mild nature of the wounds in this study was apparent by the low pain scores at the beginning of the study, which disappeared by the follow-up visits. The average wound sizes were 2.2cm2 and 1.5cm2 for the SOC and SOC+Procellera groups, respectively. This trial protocol should be conducted on open softtissue wounds in severe heat.

We Resolved Disagreement By Discussion. Clinical Heterogeneity Between The Included Trials Precluded Pooling Of Data, And Only A Descriptive Summary Is Presented. Main Results This Review Included Two Trials, Involving 103 Participants, One Comparing Titanium With Resorbable Plates And Screws And The Other Titanium With Resorbable Screws. Both Studies Were At High Risk Of Bias And Provided Very Limited Data For The Primary Outcomes Of This Review. All Participants In One Trial Suffered Mild To Moderate Postoperative Discomfort With No Statistically Significant Difference Between The Two Plating Groups At Different Follow‐Up Times. Mean Scores Of Patient Satisfaction Were 7.43 To 8.63 (Range 0 To 10) With No Statistically Significant Difference Between The Two Groups Throughout Follow‐Up.

Background Under‐ Or Overgrowth Of One Or Both Of The Jaw Bones Can Lead To Reduced Function And An Unattractive Facial Appearance, Either Of Which May Have Lasting And Significant Psychosocial Effects. Treatment Of Severe Cases May Require A Combination Of Orthodontic Appliances And Orthognathic (Corrective Jaw) Surgery. After Surgery The Cut Bone Needs To Be Immobilised To Ensure That Optimal Healing Takes Place. Titanium Plates Used For Fixation Are Recognised To Be The 'Gold Standard' But Recent Developments In Biomaterials Have Led To An Increased Use Of Bioresorbable Plates Or Screws For Corrective Jaw Surgery. The Use Of Bioresorbable Plates For The Fixation Of Facial Bones Might Appear To Reduce The Need For A Further Operation For The Removal Of Metal Plates. However, Whilst Resorbable Plates Do Appear To Offer Certain Advantages Over Metal Plates, Concerns Remain About The Stability Of Fixation, The Length Of Time Required For Their Resorption (Being Reabsorbed), The Possibility Of Foreign Body Reactions, And With Some Of The Technical Difficulties Experienced With Resorbable Plates.

It is a common phenomenon and occurs in otherwise normal individuals several times during the day and night, especially after ingestion of fluids, e.g., soup, tea, coffee, or milk. The esophagus is a muscular tubular organ responsible for the transport of food from the mouth to the stomach. The esophagus has a parasympathetic innervation through the vagus nerve, which runs along the esophagus. Sympathetic innervation arises from postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic chain. Once food enters the esophagus, it is transported by a propulsive peristaltic wave into the stomach. Pathological reflux in this age group may be characterized by different symptoms. The most typical reported signs are regurgitation and effortless leak-out of milk or food after meals, between meals, and when asleep.",True,5.0,,,,,,,True,5.0

We retrospectively analysed necropsies performed between 2012 and 2019 on 88 cetaceans stranded along the coast of Catalonia, Spain, and evaluated the association of abnormal ingested materials with 2 risk factors, namely disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and maternal separation. Abnormal materials were found in the digestive tract in 19 of 88 (21.6%) cetaceans; of these, 13 (60%) had lesions in the CNS, such as morbilliviral encephalitis, neurobrucellosis or encephalomalacia, and 3 were diagnosed as having experienced maternal separation. In a logistic regression model, CNS lesions and maternal separation were identified as risk factors for ingestion of foreign material, but with wide confidence intervals, probably due to the small sample size. In contrast, abnormal ingestion was not identified in any of the 25 (28%) cetaceans whose cause of death was attributed to interaction with humans. Abnormal ingestion should be interpreted with caution, and efforts should be made at necropsy to exclude CNS diseases through pathologic and microbiologic investigations. If disease of the CNS is a significant risk factor for ingestion of marine debris by small odontocetes, results of monitoring programmes may be biased by the prevalence of CNS disease in a specific area or population.

Its Origin Comes From Embryonic Cells Of The Notochord And It Is A Unipotent Tumor. Pyometra Is The Accumulation Of Purulent Content In The Uterine Lumen. Cystic Endometrial Hyperplasia Is One Of The Factors Predisposing A Dog To The Development Of Pyometra. The Safest And Most Efficient Treatment For Pyometra Is Ovariohysterectomy. The Purpose Of This Report Was To Describe A Case Of Ovarian Teratoma And Cystic Endometrial Hyperplasia With Concomitant Pyometra In A Labrador Retriever Bitch. Case: A 10-Year-Old Bitch Labrador Retriever, Weighing 42 Kg, Was Evaluated At Animal Care Barueri Veterinary Clinic, In Barueri, Sao Paulo. The Patient Was Referred From Another Veterinary Service To Our Clinic For An Ovariohysterectomy And Removal Of An Intestinal Foreign Body As Previous Ultrasonography (Us) Had Indicated The Presence Of Pyometra And A Foreign Body In The Descending Colon (She Had Ingested Cloth According To The Owner'S Report). Laboratory Tests, Complete Blood Count, Alanine Aminotransferase, Alkaline Phosphatase, Urea, And Creatinine Levels Did Not Show Any Significant Changes. Upon Examination, The Clinical Signs Were Mucopurulent Vaginal Discharge, 5% Dehydration, Rectal Temperature 39.1 Degrees C, Mild Abdominal Pain On Palpation, Normophagy, Normodipsia, And Normal Defecation And Urination. Laboratory Tests And A New Us Were Requested On Which The Uterus Was Observed With The Presence Of Luminal Anechoic Content And Increased Uterine Diameter (Uterine Horns 3.97 Cm), An Acoustic Intestinal Shadow Supposedly From A Foreign Body, And On The Leukogram, Leukocytosis (23,600/Mm3) Due To Neutrophilia With A Right Shift (20,532/Mm3) Was Observed. Therapeutic Ovariohysterectomy And Exploratory Celiotomy Were Chosen As Therapeutic Options. Celiotomy With Caudoumbilical Mid Ventral Access Was Performed. When The Left Uterine Horn Was Identified, An Attempt Was Made To Pull It In Order To Expose The Left Ovary, But This Maneuver Was Not Successful. For This Reason, The Abdominal Incision Was Enlarged Cranially. At That Point, A Huge Mass Was Observed In The Ovary (Which Was Supposedly The Acoustic Shadow Of The Foreign Body In The Descending Colon/Left Ovary). The Intestines Appeared Normal. Macroscopically, The Mass Had An Irregular Surface, Round Shape, Firm Consistency, And Was 15 Cm Long X 10 Cm Wide. Once Removed, The Mass Was Incised In The Transversal Direction, Purulent Content, Hair, And Mineralized Areas Inside It Were Observed. Histopathological Examination Showed Neoplastic Proliferation, Consisting Of Cells With Elongated Epithelioid Shape That Were Arranged In Long Irregular Bundles Among Well-Differentiated Adipose Tissue. An Exuberant Eosinophilic Matrix With Extensive Cystic Areas Filled With Lamellar Keratin And Hairy Stems Covered By Squamous Epithelium Was Also Observed. Extensive Areas Exhibiting Nervous Tissue With Minimal Atypia Are Shown. The Morphological Picture Was Compatible With Teratoma. Discussion: The Present Report Describes The Concomitant Presence Of Ovarian Teratoma And Pyometra In A Dog. The Diagnosis Of Pyometra Requires Complementary Tests (Laboratory And Imaging). The Intestinal Acoustic Shadow Observed On The Two Us Images Obtained By Two Different Professionals Was Suggestive Of Intestinal Foreign Body But Was Also A Wrong Diagnosis, Which Was Confirmed After An Exploratory Celiotomy When The Mass In The Left Ovary Was Identified. On The Histopathological Examination Of This Present Case, Epithelial, Nervous, And Cartilaginous Tissues Were Observed. This Differentiation Of Tissues Corroborated The Teratoma Diagnosis.

They Can Be Associated With An Impaired Skin Barrier In Early Infancy. It Is Unclear Whether Trying To Prevent Or Reverse An Impaired Skin Barrier Soon After Birth Is Effective For Preventing Eczema Or Food Allergy. Objectives Primary Objective To Assess The Effects Of Skin Care Interventions Such As Emollients For Primary Prevention Of Eczema And Food Allergy In Infants. Secondary Objective To Identify Features Of Study Populations Such As Age, Hereditary Risk, And Adherence To Interventions That Are Associated With The Greatest Treatment Benefit Or Harm For Both Eczema And Food Allergy. Search Methods We Performed An Updated Search Of The Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, Central, Medline, And Embase In September 2021. We Searched Two Trials Registers In July 2021. We Checked The Reference Lists Of Included Studies And Relevant Systematic Reviews, And Scanned Conference Proceedings To Identify Further References To Relevant Randomised Controlled Trials (Rcts).  Selection Criteria We Included Rcts Of Skin Care Interventions That Could Potentially Enhance Skin Barrier Function, Reduce Dryness, Or Reduce Subclinical Inflammation In Healthy Term (> 37 Weeks) Infants (≤ 12 Months) Without Pre‐Existing Eczema, Food Allergy, Or Other Skin Condition. Eligible Comparisons Were Standard Care In The Locality Or No Treatment. Types Of Skin Care Interventions Could Include Moisturisers/Emollients; Bathing Products; Advice Regarding Reducing Soap Exposure And Bathing Frequency; And Use Of Water Softeners. No Minimum Follow‐Up Was Required. Data Collection And Analysis This Is A Prospective Individual Participant Data (Ipd) Meta‐Analysis. We Used Standard Cochrane Methodological Procedures, And Primary Analyses Used The Ipd Dataset. Primary Outcomes Were Cumulative Incidence Of Eczema And Cumulative Incidence Of Immunoglobulin (Ig)E‐Mediated Food Allergy By One To Three Years, Both Measured At The Closest Available Time Point To Two Years. Secondary Outcomes Included Adverse Events During The Intervention Period; Eczema Severity (Clinician‐Assessed); Parent Report Of Eczema Severity; Time To Onset Of Eczema; Parent Report Of Immediate Food Allergy; And Allergic Sensitisation To Food Or Inhalant Allergen. Main Results We Identified 33 Rcts Comprising 25,827 Participants. Of These, 17 Studies Randomising 5823 Participants Reported Information On One Or More Outcomes Specified In This Review.  We Included 11 Studies, Randomising 5217 Participants, In One Or More Meta‐Analyses (Range 2 To 9 Studies Per Individual Meta‐Analysis), With 10 Of These Studies Providing Ipd; The Remaining 6 Studies Were Included In The Narrative Results Only.   Most Studies Were Conducted At Children'S Hospitals. Twenty‐Five Studies, Including All Those Contributing Data To Meta‐Analyses, Randomised Newborns Up To Age Three Weeks To Receive A Skin Care Intervention Or Standard Infant Skin Care. Eight Of The 11 Studies Contributing To Meta‐Analyses Recruited Infants At High Risk Of Developing Eczema Or Food Allergy, Although The Definition Of High Risk Varied Between Studies. Durations Of Intervention And Follow‐Up Ranged From 24 Hours To Three Years. All Interventions Were Compared Against No Skin Care Intervention Or Local Standard Care. Of The 17 Studies That Reported Information On Our Prespecified Outcomes, 13 Assessed Emollients. We Assessed Most Of The Evidence In The Review As Low Certainty And Had Some Concerns About Risk Of Bias. A Rating Of Some Concerns Was Most Often Due To Lack Of Blinding Of Outcome Assessors Or Significant Missing Data, Which Could Have Impacted Outcome Measurement But Was Judged Unlikely To Have Done So. We Assessed The Evidence For The Primary Food Allergy Outcome As High Risk Of Bias Due To The Inclusion Of Only One Trial, Where Findings Varied Based On Different Assumptions About Missing Data. Skin Care Interventions During Infancy Probably Do Not Change The Risk Of Eczema By One To Three Years Of Age (Risk Ratio (Rr) 1.03, 95% Confidence Interval (Ci) 0.81 To 1.31; Risk Difference 5 More Cases Per 1000 Infants, 95% Ci 28 Less To 47 More; Moderate‐Certainty Evidence; 3075 Participants, 7 Trials) Or Time To Onset Of Eczema (Hazard Ratio 0.86, 95% Ci 0.65 To 1.14; Moderate‐Certainty Evidence; 3349 Participants, 9 Trials). Skin Care Interventions During Infancy May Increase The Risk Of Ige‐Mediated Food Allergy By One To Three Years Of Age (Rr 2.53, 95% Ci 0.99 To 6.49; Low‐Certainty Evidence; 976 Participants, 1 Trial) But May Not Change Risk Of Allergic Sensitisation To A Food Allergen By Age One To Three Years (Rr 1.05, 95% Ci 0.64 To 1.71; Low‐Certainty Evidence; 1794 Participants, 3 Trials). Skin Care Interventions During Infancy May Slightly Increase Risk Of Parent Report Of Immediate Reaction To A Common Food Allergen At Two Years (Rr 1.27, 95% Ci 1.00 To 1.61; Low‐Certainty Evidence; 1171 Participants, 1 Trial); However, This Was Only Seen For Cow’S Milk, And May Be Unreliable Due To Over‐Reporting Of Milk Allergy In Infants. Skin Care Interventions During Infancy Probably Increase Risk Of Skin Infection Over The Intervention Period (Rr 1.33, 95% Ci 1.01 To 1.75; Risk Difference 17 More Cases Per 1000 Infants, 95% Ci One More To 38 More; Moderate‐Certainty Evidence; 2728 Participants, 6 Trials) And May Increase The Risk Of Infant Slippage Over The Intervention Period (Rr 1.42, 95% Ci 0.67 To 2.99; Low‐Certainty Evidence; 2538 Participants, 4 Trials) And Stinging/Allergic Reactions To Moisturisers (Rr 2.24, 95% 0.67 To 7.43; Low‐Certainty Evidence; 343 Participants, 4 Trials), Although Cis For Slippages And Stinging/Allergic Reactions Were Wide And Include The Possibility Of No Effect Or Reduced Risk. Preplanned Subgroup Analyses Showed That The Effects Of Interventions Were Not Influenced By Age, Duration Of Intervention, Hereditary Risk, Filaggrin ( Flg ) Mutation, Chromosome 11 Intergenic Variant Rs2212434,   Or Classification Of Intervention Type For Risk Of Developing Eczema. We Could Not Evaluate These Effects On Risk Of Food Allergy. Evidence Was Insufficient To Show Whether Adherence To Interventions Influenced The Relationship Between Skin Care Interventions And Eczema Or Food Allergy Development. Authors' Conclusions Based On Low‐ To Moderate‐Certainty Evidence, Skin Care Interventions Such As Emollients During The First Year Of Life In Healthy Infants Are Probably Not Effective For Preventing Eczema; May Increase Risk Of Food Allergy; And Probably Increase Risk Of Skin Infection. Further Study Is Needed To Understand Whether Different Approaches To Infant Skin Care Might Prevent Eczema Or Food Allergy. Plain Language Summary Skin Care Interventions For Preventing Eczema And Food Allergy Does Moisturising Baby Skin Prevent Eczema Or Food Allergies? Key Messages Skin Care Treatments In Babies, Such As Using Moisturisers On The Skin During The First Year Of Life, Probably Do Not Prevent Babies From Developing Eczema; May Increase The Chance Of Food Allergy; And Probably Increase The Chance Of Skin Infection. This Review Looked At The Prevention Of Eczema And Food Allergy Only. Skin Care Treatments Are Still Important To Treat Eczema.  What Are Allergies? An Immune Response Is How The Body Recognises And Defends Itself Against Substances That Appear Harmful. An Allergy Is A Reaction Of The Body'S Immune System To A Particular Food Or Substance (An Allergen) That Is Usually Harmless. Different Allergies Affect Different Parts Of The Body, And Their Effects Can Be Mild Or Serious. Food Allergies And Eczema Eczema Is A Common Skin Condition  That Causes Dry, Itchy, Cracked Skin. Eczema Is Common In Children, Often Developing Before Their First Birthday, And May Be Long‐Lasting. Allergies To Food Can Cause Itching In The Mouth, A Raised Itchy Red Rash, Swelling Of The Face, Stomach Symptoms, Or Difficulty Breathing. They Usually Happen Within Two Hours After A Food Is Eaten. People With Food Allergies Often Have Other Allergic Conditions, Such As Asthma, Hay Fever, And Eczema. Why We Did This Cochrane Review We Wanted To Learn How Skin Care Affects The Risk Of A Baby Developing Eczema Or Food Allergies. Skin Care Treatments Included: • Putting Moisturisers On A Baby'S Skin; • Bathing Babies With Water Containing Moisturisers Or Moisturising Oils; • Advising Parents To Use Less Soap, Or To Bathe Their Child Less Often; • Using Water Softeners.  We Also Wanted To Know If These Skin Care Treatments Cause Any Unwanted Effects.  What Did We Do? We Searched For Studies Of Different Types Of Skin Care For Healthy Babies (Aged Up To One Year) With No Previous Food Allergy, Eczema, Or Other Skin Condition. Search Date:  We Incorporated Evidence Published Up To July 2021. We Were Interested In Studies That Reported: • How Many Children Developed Eczema, Or Food Allergy, By Age One To Three Years; • How Severe The Eczema Was (According To A Researcher And To Parents); • How Long It Took For Eczema To Develop; • Parents' Reports Of Immediate (Under Two Hours) Reactions To A Food Allergen; • How Many Children Developed Sensitivity To A Particular Food Allergen; • Any Unwanted Effects. We Assessed The Strengths And Weaknesses Of Each Study To Determine How Reliable The Results Might Be, And Then Combined The Results Of The Relevant Studies And Looked At Overall Effects.   What We Found We Found 33 Studies, Involving 25,827 Babies, That Assessed Any Type Of Skin Intervention. The Included Studies Took Place In Europe, Australia, Japan, And The Usa, Most Often At Children'S Hospitals. Skin Care Was Compared Against No Skin Care Or Usual Skin Care For Babies In That Country. Treatment And Follow‐Up Times Ranged From 24 Hours To Three Years. Many Studies (13) Tested The Use Of Moisturisers; The Other Studies Mainly Tested The Use Of Bathing And Cleansing Products And How Often They Were Used. Of The 33 Included Studies, Only 11 Studies Had Comparable Outcomes Of Eczema, Food Allergy, Or Adverse Effects And Were Combined For Analysis. All Of These Studies Enrolled Babies Before They Were One Month Old, And  Eight Of These Studies Included Babies Thought To Be At High Risk For Developing Eczema.  What Are The Main Results Of Our Review? Compared To No Skin Care Or Standard Care, Moisturisers: • Probably Do Not Change The Chance Of Developing Eczema By Age One To Three Years (7 Studies; 3075 Babies), Or The Time Needed For Eczema To Develop (9 Studies; 3349 Babies); • May Increase The Chance Of Developing A Food Allergy As Judged By A Researcher (1 Study; 976 Babies) By Age One To Three Years; • May Slightly Increase The Number Of Immediate Reactions To A Common Food Allergen At Two Years, As Reported By Parents (1 Study; 1171 Babies); • Probably Cause More Skin Infections (6 Studies; 2728 Babies); • May Increase Unwanted Effects, Such As A Stinging Feeling Or An Allergic Reaction To Moisturisers (4 Studies; 343 Babies); • May Increase The Chance Of Babies Slipping (4 Studies; 2538 Babies); • May Not Affect The Chance Of Developing Sensitivity To Food Allergens (3 Studies; 1797 Babies) By Age One To Three Years. Confidence In Our Results We Are Moderately Confident In Our Results For Developing Eczema And The Time Needed To Develop Eczema. We Are Less Confident About Our Results For Food Allergy Or Sensitivity, Which Are Based On Small Numbers Of Studies With Widely Varying Results. These Results Are Likely To Change When More Evidence Becomes Available. Our Confidence In The Review Findings For Skin Infections Is Moderate, But Low For Stinging Or Allergic Reactions And Slipping. ",,True,2.0,,,,,,,True,2.0

Results Three Hundred And Thirty-Five Peri-Implant Biopsies Were Retrieved, Of Which 52 (15.5%) Were Pgcg. The Study Population Included 28 Females And 24 Males, Age 35-92 Years, Mean 61. 51.2% Reported Bone Involvement. The Lesion Involved The Margins Of The Specimen In 65.3%, Recurrence Was Reported In 46.1%.

It Is Associated With Severe Pain Developing 2 To 3 Days Postoperatively With Or Without Halitosis, A Socket That May Be Partially Or Totally Devoid Of A Blood Clot, And Increased Postoperative Visits. This Is An Update Of The Cochrane Review First Published In 2012.  Objectives To Assess The Effects Of Local Interventions Used For The Prevention And Treatment Of Alveolar Osteitis (Dry Socket) Following Tooth Extraction. Search Methods An Information Specialist Searched Four Bibliographic Databases Up To 28 September 2021 And Used Additional Search Methods To Identify Published, Unpublished, And Ongoing Studies. Selection Criteria We Included Randomised Controlled Trials Of Adults Over 18 Years Of Age Who Were Having Permanent Teeth Extracted Or Who Had Developed Dry Socket Postextraction. We Included Studies With Any Type Of Local Intervention Used For The Prevention Or Treatment Of Dry Socket, Compared To A Different Local Intervention, Placebo Or No Treatment. We Excluded Studies Reporting On Systemic Use Of Antibiotics Or The Use Of Surgical Techniques Because These Interventions Are Evaluated In Separate Cochrane Reviews. Data Collection And Analysis We Used Standard Methodological Procedures Expected By Cochrane. We Followed Cochrane Statistical Guidelines And Reported Dichotomous Outcomes As Risk Ratios (Rr) And Calculated 95% Confidence Intervals (Ci) Using Random‐Effects Models. For Some Of The Split‐Mouth Studies With Sparse Data, It Was Not Possible To Calculate Rr So We Calculated The Exact Odds Ratio (Or) Instead. We Used Grade To Assess The Certainty Of The Body Of Evidence. Main Results We Included 49 Trials With 6771 Participants; 39 Trials (With 6219 Participants) Investigated Prevention Of Dry Socket And 10 Studies (With 552 Participants) Looked At The Treatment Of Dry Socket. 16 Studies Were At High Risk Of Bias, 30 Studies At Unclear Risk Of Bias, And 3 Studies At Low Risk Of Bias. Chlorhexidine In The Prevention Of Dry Socket When Compared To Placebo, Rinsing With Chlorhexidine Mouthrinses (0.12% And 0.2% Concentrations) Both Before And 24 Hours After Extraction(S) Substantially Reduced The Risk Of Developing Dry Socket With An Or Of 0.38 (95% Ci 0.25 To 0.58; P < 0.00001; 6 Trials, 1547 Participants; Moderate‐Certainty Evidence). The Prevalence Of Dry Socket Varies From 1% To 5% In Routine Dental Extractions To Upwards Of 30% In Surgically Extracted Third Molars. The Number Of Patients Needed To Be Treated (Nnt) With Chlorhexidine Rinse To Prevent One Patient Having Dry Socket Was 162 (95% Ci 155 To 240), 33 (95% Ci 27 To 49), And 7 (95% Ci 5 To 10) For Control Prevalence Of Dry Socket 0.01, 0.05, And 0.30 Respectively.  Compared To Placebo, Placing Chlorhexidine Gel Intrasocket After Extractions Reduced The Odds Of Developing A Dry Socket By 58% With An Or Of 0.44 (95% Ci 0.27 To 0.71; P = 0.0008; 7 Trials, 753 Participants; Moderate‐Certainty Evidence). The Nnt With Chlorhexidine Gel (0.2%) To Prevent One Patient Developing Dry Socket Was 180 (95% Ci 137 To 347), 37 (95% Ci 28 To 72), And 7 (95% Ci 5 To 15) For Control Prevalence Of Dry Socket Of 0.01, 0.05, And 0.30 Respectively. Compared To Chlorhexidine Rinse (0.12%), Placing Chlorhexidine Gel (0.2%) Intrasocket After Extractions Was Not Superior In Reducing The Risk Of Dry Socket (Rr 0.74, 95% Ci 0.46 To 1.20; P = 0.22; 2 Trials, 383 Participants; Low‐Certainty Evidence).  The Present Review Found Some Evidence For The Association Of Minor Adverse Reactions With Use Of 0.12%, 0.2% Chlorhexidine Mouthrinses (Alteration In Taste, Staining Of Teeth, Stomatitis) Though Most Studies Were Not Designed Explicitly To Detect The Presence Of Hypersensitivity Reactions To Mouthwash As Part Of The Study Protocol. No Adverse Events Were Reported In Relation To The Use Of 0.2% Chlorhexidine Gel Placed Directly Into A Socket. Platelet Rich Plasma In The Prevention Of Dry Socket  Compared To Placebo, Placing Platelet Rich Plasma After Extractions Was Not Superior In Reducing The Risk Of Having A Dry Socket (Rr 0.51, 95% Ci 0.19 To 1.33; P = 0.17; 2 Studies, 127 Participants; Very Low‐Certainty Evidence).  A Further 21 Intrasocket Interventions To Prevent Dry Socket Were Each Evaluated In Single Studies, And There Is Insufficient Evidence To Determine Their Effects. Zinc Oxide Eugenol Versus Alvogyl In The Treatment Of Dry Socket Two Studies, With 80 Participants, Showed That Alvogyl (Old Formulation) Is More Effective Than Zinc Oxide Eugenol At Reducing Pain At Day 7 (Mean Difference (Md) ‐1.40, 95% Ci ‐1.75 To ‐1.04; P < 0.00001; 2 Studies, 80 Participants; Very Low‐Certainty Evidence) A Further Nine Interventions For The Treatment Of Dry Socket Were Evaluated In Single Studies, Providing Insufficient Evidence To Determine Their Effects. Authors' Conclusions Tooth Extractions Are Generally Undertaken By Dentists For A Variety Of Reasons, However, All But Five Studies Included In The Present Review Included Participants Undergoing Extraction Of Third Molars, Most Of Which Were Undertaken By Oral Surgeons. There Is Moderate‐Certainty Evidence That Rinsing With Chlorhexidine (0.12% And 0.2%) Or Placing Chlorhexidine Gel (0.2%) In The Sockets Of Extracted Teeth, Probably Results In A Reduction In Dry Socket. There Was Insufficient Evidence To Determine The Effects Of The Other 21 Preventative Interventions Each Evaluated In Single Studies. There Was Limited Evidence Of Very Low Certainty That Alvogyl (Old Formulation) May Reduce Pain At Day 7 In Patients With Dry Socket When Compared To Zinc Oxide Eugenol.  Plain Language Summary What Treatments Can Be Used To Prevent And Treat Alveolar Osteitis (Dry Socket)?  Key Messages ‐ Rinsing With Chlorhexidine Mouthwash Before A Dental Extraction Or Beginning 24 Hours After May Help To Prevent A Dry Socket.‐ Placing A Chlorhexidine Gel Directly Into The Socket Immediately After Tooth Extraction May Help To Prevent A Dry Socket.‐ Chlorhexidine Rinses Cause Some Minor Adverse (Unwanted) Effects; Chlorhexidine Intrasocket Gels Do Not Appear To Cause Adverse Effects.‐ Alvogyl Reduces The Pain Of A Dry Socket When Compared To Zinc Oxide Eugenol, But The Evidence For This Is Very Uncertain.‐ Alvogyl Does Not Appear To Cause Unwanted Effects.‐ We Need Future Studies To Strengthen The Evidence And Investigate The Best Ways To Prevent And Treat Dry Socket In All Teeth. What Is Dry Socket? Dry Socket Is A Painful Condition That Sometimes Arises After A Tooth Has Been Extracted And Is More Likely To Occur Following Extraction Of Wisdom Teeth In The Lower Jaw. What Causes Dry Socket? It Is Thought To Be Linked To The Loss Of Some Or All Of The Blood Clot That Forms At The Bottom Of A Tooth Socket After A Tooth Is Taken Out. How Can We Prevent Dry Socket? An Option For Prevention Of Dry Socket Is To Reduce Debris And The Bacterial Load In The Mouth, Though Dry Socket Is Not Bacterial In Origin. People With Poor Oral Hygiene (Food Debris And Plaque) Are At Greater Risk Of Dry Socket. Improved Oral Hygiene And Rinsing Before A Dental Extraction Or Beginning 24 Hours After May Reduce The Likelihood Of Dry Socket. How Can We Treat Dry Socket ? Options For Treating Dry Socket Largely Focus On Reducing Pain Locally Around The Tooth Extraction Site By Placing An Obtundent (A Soothing Medicated Dressing). What Did We Want To Find Out ? We Wanted To Find Out If Antiseptic Rinses, Gels, Or Healing Patches Could Help To Prevent Dry Socket. We Also Wanted To Find Out If Placing A Medicated Dressing Could Treat A Dry Socket And Whether Any Unwanted Side Effects Were Produced. What Did We Do? We Searched For Studies That Compared Antiseptic Rinses Or Intrasocket Gels With A Placebo (Dummy) Rinse Or Nothing And A Placebo (Dummy) Intrasocket Gel Or Nothing. To Find The Best Way To Treat Dry Socket We Searched For Studies That Compared Different Soothing Agents With A Placebo (Dummy) With Other Soothing Agents Or With Nothing. We Compared The Results Of The Studies And Summarised The Findings. We Made An Assessment Of Our Confidence In The Evidence Based On The Design Of The Study And The Number Of Patients Recruited. What Did We Find? We Identified 49 Trials; 39 Trials (6219 Participants) Investigated Prevention Of Dry Socket And 10 Trials (552 Participants) Investigated The Treatment Of Dry Socket. We Found That: ‐ Rinsing Both Before And After Tooth Extraction (Commencing 24 Hours After Extraction) With Chlorhexidine Gluconate Rinse (At 0.12% And 0.2% Strength) Probably Results In A Reduction In Dry Socket;‐ Placing Chlorhexidine Gel (0.2% Strength) In The Socket Of An Extracted Tooth Probably Results In A Reduction In Dry Socket;‐ Chlorhexidine Rinses And Gels Are Equally Effective At Reducing Dry Socket, But The Evidence For This Comparison Is Very Uncertain;‐ Chlorhexidine Rinses Produced Some Minor Unwanted Effects; Chlorhexidine Intrasocket Gels Appeared To Produce No Unwanted Effects;‐ There Was A Small Amount Of Evidence Of Very Low Certainty From Two Studies That Alvogyl (Old Formulation) May Reduce Pain At Day 7 In Patients With Dry Socket When Compared To Zinc Oxide Eugenol. This Evidence Relates To The Old Formulation Of Alvogyl Which Is No Longer Available. It Should Be Noted That The Formulation Of Alvogyl Has Changed, It Is Now Called Alveogyl.  Tooth Extractions Are Generally Undertaken By Dentists For A Variety Of Reasons, However, All But Five Studies Included In The Present Review Included Participants Undergoing Extraction Of Third Molars, Most Of Which Were Undertaken By Oral Surgeons.  What Are The Limitations Of The Evidence? The Main Limitation Of The Evidence Are That Studies: ‐ Reported Mostly On Tooth Extractions Involving Lower Wisdom Teeth;‐ Were Undertaken In Ways That Introduced Errors In The Conduct Of The Study Leading To Errors In The Results; And‐ Produced Imprecise Results When They Were Combined. Due To These Errors We Have Some Confidence In The Results Relating To Chlorhexidine Rinses And Gels But Further Research Is Likely To Have An Important Impact On Our Confidence In The Estimate Of Effect And May Change The Estimate. How Up To Date Is This Evidence? The Search For Existing Studies Was Completed By 28 September 2021.",,True,2.0,,,,,,,True,2.0

The Purpose Of This Report Is To Describe Our Experience Using  Endovascular Stent-Graft Treatment Without Combined Thoracic Operations For The  Treatment Of Aef In Two Specific Cases. Case Summary: We Presented Two Cases Of  Patients Complaining Of Retrosternal Discomfort Treated In Our Department For An  Aortoesophageal Fistula Caused By The Accidental Ingestion Of A Fishbone. The Two  Patients Were Effectively Managed With Combined Means Of Endoscopic, Medical  (Broad-Spectrum Antibiotic Therapy, Fasting, Gastrointestinal Decompression,  Etc.)

Choking (Often Also Called  Suffocation) Can Be Caused By Food Or Inedible Objects And Leads To Various  Degrees Of Asphyxiation Or Lack Of Oxygen In The Blood Stream. The Incidence Is  Very High In Both Young Children And Adults, Especially Seniors. However, Since  Not All Choking Episodes End Up In The Emergency Room Or Become Fatalities, They  Often Escape Statistics. Although Episodes Of Choking From Non-Edible Bodies Are  Infrequent, They Affect Mostly Young Children. Three Of The Most Common Risks For  Choking In General Are Neurological Disorders, Dysphagia And Dental Issues (Few  Or No Teeth, Unstable Or Unsuitable Prosthesis Or Orthodontic Appliances).  The  Purpose Of This Study Was To Evaluate The Risk Factors Of Choking And Ways To  Reduce/Avoid This Event. We Reported Data On A Series Of 138 Patients Admitted To  The Emergency Department Following A Choking Event, At A Hospital In Rome, Italy.

As A Clinicopathologic Disorder, A Diagnosis Of Eoe Requires A Constellation Of Clinical Symptoms Of Esophageal Dysfunction And Histologic Findings (At Least 15 Eosinophils/High‐Powered Microscope Field (Eos/Hpf)). Current Guidelines No Longer Require The Failure Of Response To Proton Pump Inhibitor Medications To Establish A Diagnosis Of Eoe, But Continue To Suggest The Exclusion Of Other Etiologies Of Esophageal Eosinophilia. The Treatment Goals For Eoe Are Improvement In Clinical Symptoms, Resolution Of Esophageal Eosinophilia And Other Histologic Abnormalities, Endoscopic Improvement, Improved Quality Of Life, Improved Esophageal Function, Minimized Adverse Effects Of Treatment, And Prevention Of Disease Progression And Subsequent Complications. Currently, There Is No Cure For Eoe, Making Long‐Term Treatment Necessary. Standard Treatment Modalities Include Dietary Modifications, Esophageal Dilation, And Pharmacologic Therapy. Effective Pharmacologic Therapies Include Corticosteroids, Rapidly Emerging Biological Therapies, And Proton Pump Inhibitor Medications. Objectives To Evaluate The Efficacy And Safety Of Medical Interventions For People With Eosinophilic Esophagitis. Search Methods We Searched Central, Medline, Embase, Clinicaltrials.Gov, And Who Ictrp To 3 March 2023. Selection Criteria Randomized Controlled Trials (Rcts) Comparing Any Medical Intervention Or Food Elimination Diet For The Treatment Of Eosinophilic Esophagitis, Either Alone Or In Combination, To Any Other Intervention (Including Placebo). Data Collection And Analysis Pairs Of Review Authors Independently Selected Studies And Conducted Data Extraction And Risk Of Bias Assessment. We Expressed Outcomes As A Risk Ratio (Rr) And As The Mean Or Standardized Mean Difference (Md/Smd) With 95% Confidence Interval (Ci). We Assessed The Certainty Of The Evidence Using Grade. Our Primary Outcomes Were: Clinical, Histological, And Endoscopic Improvement, And Withdrawals Due To Adverse Events. Secondary Outcomes Were: Serious And Total Adverse Events, And Quality Of Life. Main Results We Included 41 Rcts With 3253 Participants. Eleven Studies Included Pediatric Patients While The Rest Recruited Both Children And Adults. Four Studies Were In Patients With Inactive Disease While The Rest Were In Patients With Active Disease. We Identified 19 Intervention Comparisons. In This Abstract We Present The Results Of The Primary Outcomes For The Two Main Comparisons: Corticosteroids Versus Placebo And Biologics Versus Placebo, Based On The Prespecified Outcomes Defined Of The Primary Studies. Fourteen Studies Compared Corticosteroids To Placebo For Induction Of Remission And The Risk Of Bias For These Studies Was Mostly Low. Corticosteroids May Lead To Slightly Better Clinical Improvement (20% Higher), Measured Dichotomously (Risk Ratio (Rr) 1.74, 95% Ci 1.08 To 2.80; 6 Studies, 583 Participants; Number Needed To Treat For An Additional Beneficial Outcome (Nntb) = 4; Low Certainty), And May Lead To Slightly Better Clinical Improvement, Measured Continuously (Standard Mean Difference (Smd) 0.51, 95% Ci 0.17 To 0.85; 5 Studies, 475 Participants; Low Certainty). Corticosteroids Lead To A Large Histological Improvement (63% Higher), Measured Dichotomously (Rr 11.94, 95% Ci 6.56 To 21.75; 12 Studies, 978 Participants; Nntb = 3; High Certainty), And May Lead To Histological Improvement, Measured Continuously (Smd 1.42, 95% Ci 1.02 To 1.82; 5 Studies, 449 Participants; Low Certainty). Corticosteroids May Lead To Little To No Endoscopic Improvement, Measured Dichotomously (Rr 2.60, 95% Ci 0.82 To 8.19; 5 Studies, 596 Participants; Low Certainty), And May Lead To Endoscopic Improvement, Measured Continuously (Smd 1.33, 95% Ci 0.59 To 2.08; 5 Studies, 596 Participants; Low Certainty). Corticosteroids May Lead To Slightly Fewer Withdrawals Due To Adverse Events (Rr 0.64, 95% Ci 0.43 To 0.96; 14 Studies, 1032 Participants; Low Certainty). Nine Studies Compared Biologics To Placebo For Induction Of Remission. Biologics May Result In Little To No Difference In Clinical Improvement, Measured Dichotomously (Rr 1.14, 95% Ci 0.85 To 1.52; 5 Studies, 410 Participants; Low Certainty), And May Result In Better Clinical Improvement, Measured Continuously (Smd 0.50, 95% Ci 0.22 To 0.78; 7 Studies, 387 Participants; Moderate Certainty). Biologics Result In Better Histological Improvement (55% Higher), Measured Dichotomously (Rr 6.73, 95% Ci 2.58 To 17.52; 8 Studies, 925 Participants; Nntb = 2; Moderate Certainty). We Could Not Draw Conclusions For This Outcome When Measured Continuously (Smd 1.01, 95% Ci 0.36 To 1.66; 6 Studies, 370 Participants; Very Low Certainty). Biologics May Result In Little To No Difference In Endoscopic Improvement, Measured Dichotomously (Effect Not Estimable, Low Certainty). We Cannot Draw Conclusions For This Outcome When Measured Continuously (Smd 2.79, 95% Ci 0.36 To 5.22; 1 Study, 11 Participants; Very Low Certainty). There May Be No Difference In Withdrawals Due To Adverse Events (Rr 1.55, 95% Ci 0.88 To 2.74; 8 Studies, 792 Participants; Low Certainty). Authors' Conclusions Corticosteroids (As Compared To Placebo) May Lead To Clinical Symptom Improvement When Reported Both As Dichotomous And Continuous Outcomes, From The Primary Study Definitions. Corticosteroids Lead To A Large Increase In Histological Improvement (Dichotomous Outcome) And May Increase Histological Improvement (Continuous Outcome) When Compared To Placebo. Corticosteroids May Or May Not Increase Endoscopic Improvement (Depending On Whether The Outcome Is Measured Dichotomously Or Continuously). Withdrawals Due To Adverse Events (Dichotomous Outcome) May Occur Less Frequently When Corticosteroids Are Compared To Placebo. Biologics (As Compared To Placebo) May Not Lead To Clinical Symptom Improvement When Reported As A Dichotomous Outcome And May Lead To An Increase In Clinical Symptom Improvement (As A Continuous Outcome), From The Primary Study Definitions. Biologics Lead To A Large Increase In Histological Improvement When Reported As A Dichotomous Outcome, But This Is Uncertain When Reported As A Continuous Outcome, As Compared To Placebo. Biologics May Not Increase Endoscopic Improvement (Dichotomous Outcome), But This Is Uncertain When Measured As A Continuous Outcome. Withdrawals Due To Adverse Events As A Dichotomous Outcome May Occur As Frequently When Biologics Are Compared To Placebo. Plain Language Summary Medical Treatments For Eosinophilic Esophagitis Key Messages We Found That While Corticosteroids May Improve Patients' Symptoms, They Certainly Reduce The Amount Of Allergic Cells (Eosinophils) And They May Improve What The Disease Looks Like Under Visual Inspection (Endoscopy), When Compared To Placebo, For Children And Adults With Eosinophilic Esophagitis. They May Be Just As Safe As A Placebo (Dummy Treatment). We Found That Biologics (A Type Of Treatment That Uses Substances Made From Living Organisms To Treat Disease) May Improve Patients' Symptoms, That They Certainly Reduce The Amount Of Allergic Cells, And That They May Be No Different In Terms Of What The Disease Looks Like Under Visual Inspection, When Compared To Placebo, For Children And Adults With Eosinophilic Esophagitis. They May Be Just As Safe As A Placebo. What Is Eosinophilic Esophagitis? Eosinophilic Esophagitis Is A Long‐Term Allergic Condition In Which The Esophagus Becomes Inflamed (Sore), Which Can Lead To Difficulty Swallowing, Vomiting, Heartburn, And Chest And Stomach Pain. Particles In Foods Or The Air Cause The Immune System To Have An Allergic Reaction And Produce Immune Cells, Which Are Called Eosinophils. These Build Up In The Esophagus, The Tube That Connects The Mouth With The Stomach. Eosinophilic Esophagitis Was First Identified In The 1990S And Since Then It Has Been Recognized As A Major Digestive Illness. It Is Not Known What Causes It, But It Might Be Related To Genetics Combined With Environmental Triggers. People With Eosinophilic Esophagitis Tend To Have Other Allergies As Well. Currently, There Is No Cure For Eosinophilic Esophagitis, Making Long‐Term Treatment Necessary. Standard Treatments Include Diets, Stretching Of The Esophagus (Dilation), And Drugs Such As Corticosteroids, Biological Medications, And Proton Pump Inhibitor Medications. What Did We Want To Find Out? We Wanted To Find Out If The Available Medical Treatments For Eosinophilic Esophagitis Work For Improving Patients' Symptoms, Reducing The Amount Of Allergic Cells When Measured Under A Microscope, And Improving What The Disease Looks Like Under Visual Examination. We Also Wanted To Find Out How Safe They Are And If They Improve Quality Of Life. What Did We Do? We Searched For Randomized Controlled Trials (Studies Where People Are Assigned To One Of Two Or More Treatment Groups Using A Random Method) Comparing Any Medical Treatment For Eosinophilic Esophagitis With Any Other Medical Treatment, In Both Adults And Children. What Did We Find? We Found 41 Studies With 3253 Participants. Eleven Studies Were In Children Only While The Rest Were In A Mix Of Children And Adults. We Identified 19 Comparisons. In This Summary, We Present The Results Of The Two Main Comparisons: Corticosteroids Compared To Placebo And Biologics Compared To Placebo. We Found That Corticosteroids May Be Better Than Placebo At Improving Patients' Symptoms. We Are Highly Certain That Corticosteroids Are Better Than Placebo At Reducing The Amount Of Eosinophils (Allergic Cells) When Measured Under A Microscope. Corticosteroids May Be Better Than Placebo At Improving What The Disease Looks Like Under Visual Examination (Endoscopy). We Also Found That People Taking Corticosteroids May Be Less Likely To Leave A Study Due To Unwanted Or Harmful Effects (Side Effects), And That They Probably Experience A Similar Number Of Both Serious Side Effects And Side Effects In Total, Compared To Placebo. There May Be No Difference Between Corticosteroids And Placebo In The Improvement Of Quality Of Life. We Found That Biologics May Be Better Than Placebo At Improving Patients' Symptoms. It Is Likely That Biologics Are Better Than Placebo At Reducing The Amount Of Allergic Cells When Measured Under A Microscope. Biologics May Be No Different To Placebo At Improving What The Disease Looks Like Under Visual Examination. We Also Found That People On Biologics May Be Equally Likely To Leave A Study Due To Side Effects, Or Have Serious Side Effects, And May Experience Similar Numbers Of Total Side Effects, Compared To Placebo. There May Be No Difference Between Biologics And Placebo In The Improvement Of Quality Of Life. What Are The Limitations Of The Evidence? The Evidence In Children Only Was Quite Limited And We Do Not Know If The Conclusions Above Can Definitely Apply To Children Specifically. Another Limitation Of The Evidence Is That The Outcomes Were Measured In Many Different Ways, Which May Have Weakened Our Conclusions. Other Treatments Used By The Participants Were Also Something That Varied A Lot Between People, And May Have Affected Our Conclusions. Finally, We Were Limited In The Conclusions We Could Make About The Effects Of Sex, Age, Extent Of Disease, Dosage, And Type Of Corticosteroid Or Biologic. How Up‐To‐Date Is This Review?

Herein, We Present A Case Of Heroin  Body-Packing That Resulted In Subsequent Bowel Obstruction. Case Presentation: A  30-Year-Old Male, Who Was Brought From The Prison To The Emergency Department,  Complained Of Abdominal Pain. After The Absence Of Intoxication Symptoms And  Insignificant Plain Abdominal Radiograph Results, Abdominal Computed Tomography  (Ct) Scan Revealed The Presence Of Ingested Packets In The Stomach As Well As In  The Patient'S Small Intestine.

Yet There Remains A Dearth Of Literature On The Utility And Outcomes Of  Paediatric Gi Endoscopy In The Asia-Pacific Region. Data On The Diagnostic Value  Of Paediatric Gi Endoscopy Would Be An Important Aspect Of Discussion, With The  Emergence Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ibd) And Eosinophilic Gi Disease As  Increasingly Common Endoscopic Diagnoses. Time-Based Trends In Paediatric Gi  Endoscopy Do Point Towards More Ibd And Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Related  Complications Being Diagnosed, With A Declining Incidence Of Gi Bleeding.  However, The Real-World Diagnostic Value Of Endoscopy In Asia Must Be  Contextualised To The Region-Specific Prevalence Of Paediatric Gi Diseases.  Helicobacter Pylori Infection, Particularly That Of Multidrug-Resistant Strains,  Remains A Highly Prevalent Problem In Specific Regions. Paediatric Functional Gi  Disorders Still Account For The Majority Of Childhood Gi Complaints In Most  Centres, Hence The Diagnostic Yield Of Endoscopy Should Be Critically Evaluated  In The Absence Of Alarm Symptoms. Gi Therapeutic Endoscopy Is Also Occasionally  Required For Children With Ingested Foreign Bodies, Intestinal Polyposis Or  Oesophageal Strictures Requiring Dilation. Endoscopic Haemostasis Is A  Potentially Life-Saving Skill In Cases Of Massive Gi Bleeding Typically From  Varices Or Peptic Ulcers.

Here, We Present An Atypical Case Of Foreign Body Aspiration. Case Presentation: An 18-Year-Old Female With Major Depressive Disorder And Borderline Personality Disorder Presented For Foreign Body Aspiration. She Shared That She Uses A Box Cutter To Inflict Self-Harm And Hides It In Her Mouth. Inadvertently, She Aspirated The Box Cutter And Presented To The Hospital For The Same Reason. Besides A Mild Sore Throat, She Denied Cough, Hemoptysis Or Shortness Of Breath. She Was Hemodynamically Stable On Room Air. Her Aspiration Event Was Confirmed On A Chest X Ray, With A Blade Visualized In The Right Lower Lobe. Pulmonology Was Consulted Emergently With Plans For A Bronchoscopy The Following Morning. A Ct Chest Was Ordered To Confirm The Location Of The Box Cutter. Before This Was Performed, The Patient Spontaneously Expelled The Blade By Coughing Overnight Before Any Intervention Took Place. The Patient Did Not Suffer Any Consequence. Discussion: Physiologically, The Larynx Plays A Protective Role In Preventing Foreign Objects From Being Aspirated Via The Closure Of The Epiglottis, Vocal Cords And Cough Reflex (1). In The Absence Of Risk Factors, Aspiration Of Foreign Objects As In Our Patient Is Unlikely. Additionally, Aspirated Sharp Foreign Objects Are Extremely Hazardous And Pose A Risk Of Catastrophic Complications To The Airway Including Hemorrhage, Post Obstructive Pneumonia, Lung Abscess And Bronchiectasis. Emergent Intervention Using Rigid Bronchoscopy Is Warranted As The Spontaneous And Uneventful Expulsion Of Sharp Objects As In Our Patient, Is Rare In Literature (2).

Search Methods In October 2021, We Searched The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, Central, Medline, Embase, And Cinahl. To Identify Additional Studies, We Searched Clinical Trials Registries For Ongoing And Unpublished Studies, And Scanned Reference Lists Of Relevant Included Studies, Reviews, Meta‐Analyses, And Health Technology Reports. There Were No Restrictions On Language, Date Of Publication, Or Study Setting. Selection Criteria We Included Randomised Controlled Trials (Rcts) That Enrolled People With A Surgical Wound That Required Debridement, And Reported Time To Complete Wound Debridement Or Time To Wound Healing, Or Both. Data Collection And Analysis Two Review Authors Independently Performed Study Selection, Risk Of Bias Assessment Using The Rob 1 Tool, Data Extraction, And Grade Assessment Of The Certainty Of Evidence. Main Results In This Fourth Update, We Identified One Additional Study For Inclusion. The Review Now Includes Six Studies, With 265 Participants, Aged Three To 91 Years. Five Studies Were Published Between 1979 And 1990 And One Published In 2014. The Studies Were Carried Out In Hospital Settings In China, Denmark, Belgium, And The Uk. Six Studies Provided Six Comparisons. Due To The Heterogeneity Of Studies, It Was Not Appropriate To Conduct Meta‐Analyses. Four Studies Evaluated The Effectiveness Of Dextranomer Beads/Paste; However, Each Study Used A Different Comparator (Eusol‐Soaked Dressings, 10% Aqueous Polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% Chloramine‐Soaked Packs, And Silicone Foam Elastomer Dressing). One Study Compared Streptokinase/Streptodornase With Saline‐Soaked Dressings, And One Compared Endoscopic Surgical Debridement With Conventional 'Open' Surgical Debridement. Five Studies Reported Time To Complete Debridement (Reported As Time To A Clean Wound Bed) And Three Reported Time To Complete Healing. One Study Reported Effect Estimates (Surgical Debridement Via Endoscopy Versus Surgical Debridement) For Time To A Clean Wound Bed And Time To Complete Wound Healing, And It Was Possible To Calculate Effect Estimates For One Other Study (Dextranomer Paste Versus Silicone Foam Elastomer) For Time To Complete Wound Healing. For The Other Four Studies That Did Not Report Effect Estimates, It Was Not Possible To Calculate Time To A Clean Wound Bed Or Time To Complete Wound Healing Due To Missing Variance And Participant Exclusions. None Of The Included Studies Reported Outcomes Pertaining To Proportion Of Wounds Completely Healed, Rate Of Reduction In Wound Size, Rate Of Infection, Or Quality Of Life. All Studies Had Unclear Or High Risk Of Bias For At Least One Key Domain. Dextranomer Paste/Beads (Autolytic Debridement) Compared With Four Different Comparators Four Studies Compared Dextranomer Paste Or Beads With Eusol‐Soaked Gauze (20 Participants), 10% Aqueous Polyvinylpyrrolidone (40 Participants), 0.1% Chloramine‐Soaked Dressings (28 Participants), Or Silicone Foam Elastomer (50 Participants). There Is Very Low‐Certainty Evidence That There May Be No Clear Difference In Time To A Clean Wound Bed Between Dextranomer Beads And Eusol Gauze. The Study Did Not Report Adverse Events. There Is Very Low‐Certainty Evidence That There May Be No Difference In Time To A Clean Wound Bed Between Dextranomer Paste And 10% Aqueous Polyvinylpyrrolidone Gauze. There Was Low‐Certainty Evidence That There May Be No Difference In Deaths And Serious Adverse Events. There May Be A Difference In Time Until The Wounds Were Clinically Clean And Time To Complete Wound Healing Between Dextranomer Paste And 0.1% Chloramine Favouring 0.1% Chloramine, But We Are Very Uncertain. There Is Low‐Certainty Evidence That There May Be No Difference In Deaths And Serious Adverse Events. There Is Very Low‐Certainty Evidence That There May Be No Difference In Time To Complete Healing Between Dextranomer Beads And Silicone Foam Elastomer. The Study Did Not Report Adverse Events. Streptokinase/Streptodornase Solution (Enzymatic) Compared With Saline‐Soaked Dressings One Study (21 Participants) Compared Enzymatic Debridement With Saline‐Soaked Dressings. There Is Low‐Certainty Evidence That There May Be No Difference In Time To A Clean Wound Bed Or Secondary Suture Between Streptokinase/Streptodornase And Saline‐Soaked Dressings. There Is Very Low‐Certainty Evidence That There May Be No Difference In Deaths And Serious Adverse Events. Surgical Debridement Via Endoscopic ('Keyhole') Surgery Compared With Surgical Debridement By 'Open' Surgery (The Wound Is Opened Using A Scalpel) One Study (106 Participants) Reported Time To Complete Wound Healing And Time To A Clean Wound Bed. There Is Low‐Certainty Evidence That There May Be A Reduction In Time To Complete Wound Healing And Very Low‐Certainty Evidence That There May Be No Difference In Time To A Clean Wound Bed With Surgical Debridement Via Endoscopy Compared To 'Open' Surgical Debridement. The Study Did Not Report Adverse Events. Overall, The Evidence Was Low To Very Low‐Certainty For All Outcomes. Five Included Studies Were Published Before 1991 And Investigated Treatments That Are No Longer Available. Worldwide Production Of Dextranomer Products Has Been Discontinued, Except For Dextranomer Paste, Which Is Currently Only Available In South Africa. Furthermore, Eusol, Used In One Study As The Comparator To Dextranomer, Is Rarely Used Due To Risk Of Harmful Effects On Healthy Tissue And The Enzymatic Agent Streptokinase/Streptodornase Is No Longer Available Worldwide. Authors' Conclusions Evidence For The Effects Of Different Methods Of Debridement On Complete Wound Debridement And Healing Of Surgical Wounds Remains Unclear. Adequately Powered, Methodologically Robust Rcts Evaluating Contemporary Debridement Interventions For Surgical Wounds Are Needed To Guide Clinical Decision‐Making. Plain Language Summary Is There A Best Way To Remove Dead Tissue From Surgical Wounds? Key Message We Cannot Be Certain Whether Removal Of Dead Or Infected Tissue Of Surgical Wounds Or Care That Is Usually Provided Makes Any Difference To How Long It Takes To Remove All Of The Dead Tissue From The Wound And For The Wound To Heal. What Did We Want To Find Out? Following Surgery, Most Surgical Wounds Heal Naturally With No Complications. However, Complications Such As Infection Can Occur, Which May Result In Delayed Healing. There Are Many Different Methods Of Removing Dead Or Infected Tissue (Called Debridement), Such As Surgical Removal Of The Tissue, Enzymes (Naturally Occurring Proteins That Dissolve The Tissue), And Mechanical Methods (For Example, A Special Dry Gauze That Is Removed When The Tissue Has Stuck To It). We Wanted To Look At The Different Ways To Remove Dead Or Infected Tissue From Wounds After Surgical Operations And Find Out How They Affect The Time It Takes To Remove All Of The Dead Tissue From The Wound And For The Wound To Heal. What Did We Do? We Searched Medical Databases For Well‐Designed Studies Including People Of Any Age That Compared One Method Of Debridement Versus A Dummy Treatment (Placebo), No Treatment, Or Another Method Of Debridement After Surgery. What Did We Find? We Found Six Studies Dating From 1979 To 2014 That Compared Different Types Of Wound Debridement With The Way Care Was Usually Provided For Wounds That Had Dead Tissue Within Them After Surgery. All Six Studies Compared Different Types Of Debridement Methods Or Different Types Of Usual Care, Meaning We Could Not Combine The Results. The Total Number Of Participants Within The Studies Was 265, And Ages Of Participants Ranged From Three To 91 Years. The Studies Were Carried Out In Hospitals In China, Denmark, Belgium, And The Uk. Four Studies Compared A Treatment Method That Promotes The Body'S Natural Wound Healing Process (Called Autolytic) With Different Types Of Usual Care. Overall, We Found That This Method May Make Little Or No Difference To How Long It Takes To Remove All Of The Dead Tissue. One Study Compared An Enzyme With Usual Care, And We Found That This Method May Make Little Or No Difference To How Long It Takes To Remove All Of The Dead Tissue. One Study Compared Different Methods Of Removing Dead Tissue Using Surgery (One Via 'Keyhole' Surgery, The Other 'Normal' Surgery). We Found That Using Keyhole Surgery To Remove The Dead Tissue May Have Little Or No Effect On Time For The Wound To Heal, But We Are Very Uncertain About The Results. Only Three Of The Studies (Two Autolytic And One Using An Enzyme) Reported Serious Harmful Events That Led To Discontinuation Of Treatment Or Hospital Admission. There May Be No Difference In Deaths And Serious Harmful Events Between The Treatment Methods. Overall, All The Studies Indicated That It Is Unclear Whether Any Type Of Wound Debridement Is Better Than Usual Care At Reducing Time To Remove All Of The Dead Tissue, Time To Complete Healing, Serious Harmful Events That Led To Discontinuation Of Treatment, Or Hospital Admission. What Are The Limitations Of The Evidence? Overall, We Are Very Uncertain About The Evidence, Mainly Because The Studies Had Small Numbers Of People, And Did Not Report The Results Well. Additionally, Five Studies Used Debridement Products That Are No Longer Used Clinically. How Up To Date Is The Evidence? We Searched For Studies Published Up To October 2021.",,True,2.0,,,,,,,True,2.0

The Presentation Of Hnc Can Vary Between Developing And Developed Countries Due To Socioeconomic Factors. The Current Study Aimed To Profile The Swallowing Function Of Hnc Patients Before Starting Radiation Therapy In A Tertiary Hospital In India. Method: This Cross-Sectional Observational Study Examined Patients With Hnc Who Were Scheduled For Radiation Therapy. The Functional Oral Intake Scale (Fois) And Karnofsky Performance Status Scale Were Used To Assess The Patients’ Swallowing Status And Functional Abilities, Respectively. The Study Also Evaluated The Relationship Between Swallowing Function And Clinical-Demographic Factors. Results: Our Assessment Of 162 Hnc Patients Found That The Cancer Site Significantly Affects Swallowing. Although 92% Of Patients Had An Oral Diet, 64% Made Dietary Modifications. Patients With Non-Oral Intake Had Either Oral Or Pharyngeal Cancer, And Over 80% Of Oral Cancer Patients And 60% Of Those With Pharyngeal Cancer Had Already Made Changes To Their Diet. Patients With Laryngeal Cancer Had A Better Oral Intake, With 58% Reporting No Swallowing Issues. Conclusion: Patients With Hnc Scheduled For Radiation Therapy May Experience Varying Degrees Of Swallowing Difficulty. Early Intervention And Teaching Of Safe Swallowing Strategies Are Crucial To Prepare For The Potential Worsening Of Swallowing Difficulties Resulting From The Treatment.

Treatments Include Supportive Therapy, Antidotes (When Available) And Decontamination Techniques With The Aim Of Reducing Drugs Absorption By The Gastrointestinal System To Minimize Toxicity. Nevertheless, The Decontamination Techniques Currently Used, Such As Gastric Lavage (Gl), Activated Charcoal Or Whole-Bowel Irrigation, Have A Questionable Effectiveness. Endoscopic Gastric Decontamination (Egd) Treatment For Massive Ingestion Of Drugs Or Formation Of Pharmacobezoars Is Currently Described Only In Anecdotal Cases. Here We Describe The Management Of An Intentional Drug Overdose In An Adolescent Patient Treated With Egd And The Effects Of This Therapy On Drugs Pharmacokinetics. Case Report: A 15-Year-Old Boy Was Admitted In An Unconscious State (Glasgow Coma Scale: 7–8) To The Pediatric Intensive Care Unit After Assuming An Unspecified Amount Of Quetiapine, Aspirin, Bisoprolol, Fluoxetine, Furosemide, Alprazolam, And Pregabalin Pills. Rapid Sequence Intubation Was Immediately Performed And Then The Patient Was Treated With Symptomatic Therapy And Gl With Minimal Removal Of Gastric Material. Accounting For The Type Of Drugs, The Time Elapsed From Oral Assumption And The Unknown Quantity Assumed, Egd Was Attempted With Aim Of Removing Potential Aggregate Of The Drugs. Serial Blood Samples Were Taken Before And After Egd To Measure The Plasma Level Of The Drugs. A Pharmacobezoar Was Found And Was Immediately Removed With Egd. The Results Of The Drug Monitoring Showed That Quetiapine Exceeded The Toxic Level Reported In Literature Indicating That It May Have Been The Drug Assumed In Higher Quantity By Our Patient. Picu Stay Was Uneventful, And The Patient Was Transferred To The Psychiatric Ward After Extubation. Discussion: Our Case Shows How Gl Is Not Effective In Mitigating Multidrug Absorption Especially Drugs Potentially Inducing Pharmacobezoars. Furthermore, Based On Our Plasma Drug Monitoring, We Believe That Early Egd Should Be Considered In All Cases Of Massive Pill Intake, Prolonged Release Drugs That Can Form Pharmacobezoars Or In Cases Where A Life-Threatening Dose Cannot Be Excluded.",,True,7.0,True,2.0,,,,,True,7.0

Methods: A  New Cr2032 Bb And Artificial Saliva Were Placed In A Fresh Pig Esophagus With The  Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve (Rln); The Negative Electrode Faced The Nerve In The  Experimental Group, While The Positive Electrode Faced The Nerve In The Control  Group. The Ph Values Of The Intra- And Extraesophageal Walls Were Measured  Simultaneously. Pathological Examination Was Performed After The Esophagus And  Nerves Were Damaged. Results: After Bb Ingestion, The Ph Near The Intraesophageal  Negative Electrode Increased Rapidly, Reaching 11.5 At 30 Min And Over 14 At 6 H,  While The Extraesophageal Ph Did Not Change At 1 H And Began To Accelerate After  2 H, Reaching 10 At 6 H.
