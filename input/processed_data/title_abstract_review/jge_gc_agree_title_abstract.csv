METHODS: For children under 15 years, all Victorian public hospital admissions, July 1987 to June 1995, due to asphyxiation or 'foreign body entering through other orifice' (which includes ingestions), were reviewed. Emergency department presentations due to asphyxiation and foreign body ingestion provided information on circumstances of, and the type of foreign bodies involved in the injuries. RESULTS: The childhood average annual admission rate for asphyxiation was 15.1 per 100,000. Food related asphyxiation peaked in infants under 1 year, and declined to low levels by 3 years. The main foods involved were nuts, carrot, apple, and candy. The rate of non-food related asphyxiation was relatively constant to 3 years of age and then declined by 6 years. Mechanical suffocation was less common. The annual admission rate for 'foreign body entering through other orifice' was 31.7 per 100,000. These injuries peaked in 2-3 year olds then gradually declined. About 80% of these foreign body admissions were ingestions, with coins being the major object ingested. Admission rates for these causes remained constant over the eight years. Asphyxiation resulted in a higher proportion admitted and longer hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of suffocation and strangulation needs to focus on a safe sleeping environment and avoidance of ropes and cords, while foreign body asphyxiation and ingestion needs a focus on education of parents and child carers regarding age, appropriate food, risk of play with coins, and other small items. Legislation for toy small parts could be extended to those used by children up to the age of 5 years, and to other products marketed for children. Design changes and warning labels also have a place in prevention.",False,,False,,Unclear,"Likely to be accidental , but might include some intentional foreign objects"

The Main Purpose Of This Case ...,"There is a limited number of case presentations in literature re-
lated to esophagus burns and complications as a result of swallow-
ing an alkaline battery. The main purpose of this case presentation
was to discuss the autopsy findings of late-developing complications
of swallowing an alkali battery in the light of the relevant literature.
On the chest radiography of a 9-month old baby with complaints
of vomiting for three days, an opacity was observed consistent with
a foreign body in the esophagus. Esophagoscopy was applied and
the swallowed battery was removed. On the fifth day after the opera-
tion, no complication has been observed to oral feeding was started
and on the following day the patient was discharged. Four days after
discharge, the patient was again brought to hospital with complaints
of blood in vomit and was again hospitalized with a diagnosis of
chemical esophageal burn. The patient died on the following day.
In the performed autopsy, findings of esophagotracheal fistula, cor-
rosive burn and gastrointestinal system bleeding were determined.
As the dimensions of an alkaline battery increase, the contact
surface increases and may this cause greater damage and toxicity. A
long contact period also increases the toxic effect of the battery. Ear-
ly diagnosis is essential to prevent late-developing complications.",False,,False,,Unclear,"Likely to be accidental , but might include some intentional "

We prospectively evaluated 52 consecutive children who had swallowed coins to determine the incidence of asymptomatic esophageal coins and the rate of spontaneous passage. All patients had a roentgenogram; coins were removed from the esophagus if the patient was symptomatic. Children with asymptomatic esophageal coins were allowed less than 24 hours to pass the coin to the stomach. Thirty children had esophageal coins; of these, 9 (30%) were asymptomatic. The presence of symptoms was significantly associated with esophageal coins, but the absence of symptoms did not reliably exclude the possibility of an esophageal coin. All children who swallow coins should undergo roentgenographic evaluation.",False,,False,,Unclear,Could well include intentional coin ingestion

Endoscopic methods [endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)] are useful tools to diagnose and manage
chronic pancreatitis. Pediatric knowledge and use of these modalities is
limited and warrants dissemination.
Methods: Literature review of publications relating to use of ERCP and EUS
for diagnosis and/or management of chronic pancreatitis with special attention
to studies involving 018 years old subjects was conducted with summaries
generated. Recommendations were developed and voted upon by authors.
Results: Both EUS and ERCP can be used even in small children to assist in
diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in cases where cross-sectional imaging is
not sufficient to diagnose or characterize the disease. Children under 15 kg
for EUS and 10 kg for ERCP can be technically challenging. These
procedures should be done optimally by appropriately trained endoscopists
and adult gastroenterology providers with appropriate experience treating
children. EUS and ERCP-related risks both include perforation, bleeding and
pancreatitis. EUS is the preferred diagnostic modality over ERCP because of
lower complication rates overall. Both modalities can be used for management
of chronic pancreatitis -related fluid collections. ERCP has successfully been
used to manage pancreatic duct stones.
Conclusion: EUS and ERCP can be safely used to diagnose chronic pancreatitis
in pediatric patients and assist in management of chronic pancreatitis-related
complications. Procedure-related risks are similar to those seen in adults, with
EUS having a safer risk profile overall. The recent increase in pediatric-trained
specialists will improve access of these modalities for children.",False,,False,,Unclear,Likely to include intentional ingestion
