However, to date there have been no critical evaluations of their methodological rigor or quality. Herein, we address this need via the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument. Methods: A literature search of Embase, MEDLINE via PubMed, and Scopus was performed up until February 25, 2021. Identified CPGs were then assessed by four independent reviewers trained in AGREE II. A scaled domain score of >60% was indicated as satisfactory quality. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to assess inter-reviewer agreement. Results: 11 guidelines were assessed with only one being classified as high quality and others being either average (two) or low quality (eight). Domain 4 (clarity of presentation) achieved the highest mean score (66.41 ± 13.33%), while domain 5 (applicability) achieved the lowest score (10.80 ± 10.37%). ICC analysis revealed generally strong agreement between reviewers with a range of 0.60–0.98.

Most cases pass through the esophagus slowly; however, in some cases, the tumor may be located in narrower areas of the digestive tract that require endoscopic or surgical intervention. This study describes a rare case of successful removal of more than 450 pieces of metal objects from the stomach of a 36-year-old man via ingestion of foreign bodies at Imam Khomeini Hospital in Ahvaz. Case presentation: A 36-year-old male patient (Aryan race) presented with complaints of chronic abdominal pain, frequent vomiting, and intolerance to liquids and food. The patient’s companions mentioned a history of gradual ingestion of small metal objects 3 months prior. The patient was conscious and had stable vital signs. In the patient’s X-ray and endoscopy, multiple metal objects inside the patient’s stomach were observed, causing gastric outlet obstruction. The patient underwent gastrostomy surgery, and 452 screws, nuts, keys, stones, and other metal parts weighing 2900 g were removed from the stomach. Five days after the operation, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric service in good general condition and was diagnosed with psychosis, and her condition returned to normal at follow-up. Conclusion: Successful removal of this foreign body is rare. In chronic abdominal pain, especially in the context of psychiatric disorders, attention should be given to the ingestion of foreign bodies. In swallowing large amounts of sharp and metallic foreign objects, surgical intervention is necessary, especially in cases of obstruction, and saves the patient’s life.",,"Foreign body ingestion,Gastric outlet obstruction,Gastrotomy,Iran","metal","hemoglobin (endogenous compound)","ingestion, pylorus stenosis, stomach","abdominal pain, adult, article, body mass, case report, clinical article, diastolic blood pressure, endoscopy, follow up, foreign body, gastrostomy, gastrotomy, good general condition, hematocrit, human, intensive care unit, international normalized ratio, leukocyte count, male, mental disease, mental health, mental health service, nutritional intolerance, platelet count, psychosis (diagnosis), swallowing, systolic blood pressure, vital sign, vomiting, X ray, X ray analysis",,,,,"hemoglobin (9008-02-0)",,"Psychiatry (32), Gastroenterology (48)",,"English","English",,39148113,L2030993558,10.1186/s13256-024-04672-3,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13256-024-04672-3","https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2030993558&from=export","https://libkey.io/libraries/1675/openurl?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=17521947&id=doi:10.1186%2Fs13256-024-04672-3&atitle=This+is+a+successful+removal+of+more+than+450+pieces+of+metal+objects+from+a+patient%E2%80%99s+stomach%3A+a+case+report&stitle=J.+Med.+Case+Rep.&title=Journal+of+Medical+Case+Reports&volume=18&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Farhadi&aufirst=Farbod&auinit=F.&aufull=Farhadi+F.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2024&auinit1=F&auinitm=","Copyright 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Treatments include supportive therapy, antidotes (when available) and decontamination techniques with the aim of reducing drugs absorption by the gastrointestinal system to minimize toxicity. Nevertheless, the decontamination techniques currently used, such as gastric lavage (GL), activated charcoal or whole-bowel irrigation, have a questionable effectiveness. Endoscopic gastric decontamination (EGD) treatment for massive ingestion of drugs or formation of pharmacobezoars is currently described only in anecdotal cases. Here we describe the management of an intentional drug overdose in an adolescent patient treated with EGD and the effects of this therapy on drugs pharmacokinetics. Case report: A 15-year-old boy was admitted in an unconscious state (Glasgow Coma Scale: 7–8) to the pediatric intensive care unit after assuming an unspecified amount of quetiapine, aspirin, bisoprolol, fluoxetine, furosemide, alprazolam, and pregabalin pills. Rapid sequence intubation was immediately performed and then the patient was treated with symptomatic therapy and GL with minimal removal of gastric material. Accounting for the type of drugs, the time elapsed from oral assumption and the unknown quantity assumed, EGD was attempted with aim of removing potential aggregate of the drugs. Serial blood samples were taken before and after EGD to measure the plasma level of the drugs. A pharmacobezoar was found and was immediately removed with EGD. The results of the drug monitoring showed that quetiapine exceeded the toxic level reported in literature indicating that it may have been the drug assumed in higher quantity by our patient. PICU stay was uneventful, and the patient was transferred to the psychiatric ward after extubation. Discussion: Our case shows how GL is not effective in mitigating multidrug absorption especially drugs potentially inducing pharmacobezoars. Furthermore, based on our plasma drug monitoring, we believe that early EGD should be considered in all cases of massive pill intake, prolonged release drugs that can form pharmacobezoars or in cases where a life-threatening dose cannot be excluded.",,"Adolescent self-harm,Endoscopic decontamination,Gastric decontamination,Pediatric poisoning,Pharmacobezoar","","acetylsalicylic acid (drug therapy, special situation for pharmacovigilance), alprazolam (drug therapy, special situation for pharmacovigilance), bisoprolol (drug therapy, special situation for pharmacovigilance), fluoxetine (drug concentration, drug therapy, special situation for pharmacovigilance), furosemide (drug therapy, special situation for pharmacovigilance), pregabalin (drug concentration, drug therapy, special situation for pharmacovigilance), quetiapine (drug concentration, drug therapy, special situation for pharmacovigilance)","bezoar (drug therapy), decontamination, endoscopic gastric decontamination, pharmacokinetics","adolescent, article, blood gas analysis, bradycardia, bradypnea, case report, Chromsystems, clinical article, computer assisted tomography, electrocardiography, extubation, female, gastric pharmacobezoar (drug therapy), gastrointestinal endoscopy, Glasgow coma scale, high performance liquid chromatograph, human, ingestion, intubation, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, male, pediatric intensive care unit, resuscitation, stomach emptying, UHPLC Agilent 1290 Infinity II 6470",,,"Chromsystems (Chromsystems, Germany), UHPLC Agilent 1290 Infinity II 6470 (Agilent, United States)","Chromsystems (Germany), Agilent (United States)","acetylsalicylic acid (493-53-8, 50-78-2, 53663-74-4, 53664-49-6, 63781-77-1), alprazolam (28981-97-7, 135748-32-2), bisoprolol (66722-44-9), fluoxetine (54910-89-3, 56296-78-7, 59333-67-4, 57226-07-0), furosemide (54-31-9), pregabalin (148553-50-8), quetiapine (111974-72-2, 111974-69-7)",,"Radiology (14), Biophysics, Bioengineering and Medical Instrumentation (27), Drug Literature Index (37), Gastroenterology (48), Pediatrics and Pediatric Surgery (7)",,"English","English",,,L2032949938,10.1016/j.toxrep.2024.101683,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2024.101683","https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2032949938&from=export","https://libkey.io/libraries/1675/openurl?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=22147500&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.toxrep.2024.101683&atitle=Pharmacokinetic+effects+of+endoscopic+gastric+decontamination+for+multidrug+gastric+pharmacobezoars&stitle=Toxicol.+Rep.&title=Toxicology+Reports&volume=13&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Marano&aufirst=&auinit=M.&aufull=Marano+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2024&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Copyright 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Purpose: To evaluate the potential value of computed tomography (CT) in guiding the selection of surgical treatment for patients with ingested foreign bodies in the lower gastrointestinal tract. Methods: Between January 2014 and December 2023, we analyzed the data of 58 patients (median age: 65.4 years; range, 31–96 years) with ingested foreign bodies in the lower gastrointestinal tract who underwent CT examinations. Patients were treated either conservatively (35 cases) or surgically (23 cases). The angle between the long axis of the foreign body and the intestinal canal (FB-IC angle) was measured. CT findings and clinical variables were evaluated to identify potential indicators for surgical treatment through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results: Univariate analysis revealed the FB-IC angle (P = 0.002), presence of free peritoneal gas (P = 0.002), white blood cell count (P = 0.018), and neutrophil count (P = 0.007) as significant factors associated with surgical treatment. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the FB-IC angle (odds ratio, 1.033; P = 0.045) and the presence of free peritoneal gas (odds ratio, 41.335; P = 0.002) are independent indicators for surgical management. The FB-IC angle showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.755, with a cutoff value of 51.25 degrees. Conclusion: The FB-IC angle and presence of free peritoneal gas serve as potential predictive imaging markers for surgical intervention.

Here, we present an atypical case of foreign body aspiration. CASE PRESENTATION: An 18-year-old female with major depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder presented for foreign body aspiration. She shared that she uses a box cutter to inflict self-harm and hides it in her mouth. Inadvertently, she aspirated the box cutter and presented to the hospital for the same reason. Besides a mild sore throat, she denied cough, hemoptysis or shortness of breath. She was hemodynamically stable on room air. Her aspiration event was confirmed on a chest x ray, with a blade visualized in the right lower lobe. Pulmonology was consulted emergently with plans for a bronchoscopy the following morning. A CT chest was ordered to confirm the location of the box cutter. Before this was performed, the patient spontaneously expelled the blade by coughing overnight before any intervention took place. The patient did not suffer any consequence. DISCUSSION: Physiologically, the larynx plays a protective role in preventing foreign objects from being aspirated via the closure of the epiglottis, vocal cords and cough reflex (1). In the absence of risk factors, aspiration of foreign objects as in our patient is unlikely. Additionally, aspirated sharp foreign objects are extremely hazardous and pose a risk of catastrophic complications to the airway including hemorrhage, post obstructive pneumonia, lung abscess and bronchiectasis. Emergent intervention using rigid bronchoscopy is warranted as the spontaneous and uneventful expulsion of sharp objects as in our patient, is rare in literature (2). CONCLUSIONS: Foreign body aspiration of sharp objects calls for immediate intervention due to the risk of lethal complications, given that the occurrence of spontaneous and atraumatic expulsion is extremely rare.

Pediatric gastroenterologists and surgeons were increasingly tasked with removing these problematic objects. The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) in the management of ingested magnets. Patients and Methods: This is a single-center, retrospective assessment of surgical interventions for ingested magnets. International Classification of Disease, 10th revision codes were used to identify 349 patients ≤21 years of age evaluated for foreign body ingestion over a 4.5-year period. A medical record review helped isolate 29 (8.3%) magnet ingestions, 9 requiring surgical intervention. RedCap was used for analysis. Results: Of 9 surgical patients, 7 underwent SILS intervention by 1 surgeon. Another surgeon performed an open operation, whereas a third performed a multiport operation. Of the 7 SILS cases, 3 were completed without conversion to open. In one of these cases, bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed. For SILS cases, average operating room time was 109 minutes (38-170 minutes), time to enteral feeds was 23 hours (0.28-79.2 hours), and hospital length of stay (LOS) was 3.8 days (1.96-6.68 days). Thirty-day readmission for SILS was 14.3%. No other complications were observed. Conclusions: SILS has been safely utilized for magnet retrieval. It offers an ability to identify the affected intestinal segment and an opportunity to intervene extracorporeally through an uncapped port. In addition, knowing where matted bowel is located can direct a limited incision during conversion to laparotomy. This may confer benefits of decreased pain, shortened time to enteral feeds, and decreased hospital LOS.",,"buckeyball,foreign body ingestion,neodymium,rare earth magnet","","bicarbonate plus macrogol 3350 plus potassium chloride plus sodium chloride plus sodium sulfate (special situation for pharmacovigilance)","foreign body (surgery), laparoscopic surgery, magnet, single incision laparoscopic surgery","article, case report, child, conversion to open surgery, diverticulectomy, enteric feeding, female, hospital readmission, human, ICD-10, ingestion, intestine anastomosis, intestine resection, laparoscopic access port, laparoscopy, laparotomy, length of stay, major clinical study, male, Meckel diverticulum (surgery), medical record review, operating room, operation duration, pediatric surgery, preschool child, retrospective study, school child, single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy, stomach tube, surgeon, surgical patient","golytely",,,,"bicarbonate plus macrogol 3350 plus potassium chloride plus sodium chloride plus sodium sulfate (1134204-96-8)",,"Drug Literature Index (37), Gastroenterology (48), Pediatrics and Pediatric Surgery (7)",,"English","English",,38016150,L2028871936,10.1089/lap.2023.0394,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/lap.2023.0394","https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2028871936&from=export","https://libkey.io/libraries/1675/openurl?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=15579034&id=doi:10.1089%2Flap.2023.0394&atitle=Utilization+of+Single-Incision+Laparoscopy+in+the+Management+of+Ingested+Magnets&stitle=J.+Laparoendosc.+Adv.+Surg.+Techn.&title=Journal+of+Laparoendoscopic+and+Advanced+Surgical+Techniques&volume=34&issue=6&spage=530&epage=534&aulast=Ardila&aufirst=Sara&auinit=S.&aufull=Ardila+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=530-534&date=2024&auinit1=S&auinitm=","Copyright 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The presentation of HNC can vary between developing and developed countries due to socioeconomic factors. The current study aimed to profile the swallowing function of HNC patients before starting radiation therapy in a tertiary hospital in India. Method: This cross-sectional observational study examined patients with HNC who were scheduled for radiation therapy. The Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) and Karnofsky Performance Status Scale were used to assess the patients’ swallowing status and functional abilities, respectively. The study also evaluated the relationship between swallowing function and clinical-demographic factors. Results: Our assessment of 162 HNC patients found that the cancer site significantly affects swallowing. Although 92% of patients had an oral diet, 64% made dietary modifications. Patients with non-oral intake had either oral or pharyngeal cancer, and over 80% of oral cancer patients and 60% of those with pharyngeal cancer had already made changes to their diet. Patients with laryngeal cancer had a better oral intake, with 58% reporting no swallowing issues. Conclusion: Patients with HNC scheduled for radiation therapy may experience varying degrees of swallowing difficulty. Early intervention and teaching of safe swallowing strategies are crucial to prepare for the potential worsening of swallowing difficulties resulting from the treatment.

It can be ingested intentionally or accidentally. The small bowel bezoar prevalence ranges between 0.4 % and 4 %, and the prevalence is less than 0.5 % for gastric bezoars. There are different types of bezoars, but the mention of a plastic bezoar rarely appears in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a plastic bezoar in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Case presentation: A 58-year-old woman was admitted for acute kidney injury, and while working her up, it was discovered that she had a possible foreign body on computerized tomography scan. As a result, she underwent exploratory laparotomy with the findings of plastic foreign objects identified 90 cm from the ileocecal valve and other objects identified in the stomach. Clinical discussion: The impaction of these materials often occurs in narrow areas such as the lower esophagus, duodenum, ileocecal valve or even the anus. In this unique case, two points of impaction were noted: the first was in the small bowel and the second point in the stomach. The approach to such cases could be Endoscopic versus surgical or even chemical dissolution as a choice of treatment is dependent on multiple factors.

In contrast, recurrent and intentional FBI (RIFBI) is infrequent and associated with greater endoscopic and surgical intervention in adults. Although pediatric guidelines exist for FBI, the risk and therapeutic implications of RIFBI are not addressed. An anonymous international survey on pediatric gastroenterologist experience with RIFBI was distributed. Methods: A 33-item REDCap© survey was distributed via email to pediatric gastroenterologists identified through mailing and email lists obtained from pediatric gastroenterology professional organizations. Results: During 9−12/2021 we accrued 202 completed surveys. Respondents were from 27 countries and across the career span. Eighty percent reported experience with RIFBI; 74% reported seeing ≤ 3 patients with RIFBI within the past 24 months and 4% reported seeing ≥ 6. Of those who treated RIFBI, 38% reported an average number of annual ingestions per patient was ≥5. Frequent morbidity but not mortality was reported. Half reported adherence to FBI guidelines. Later-career endoscopists treated RIFBI more aggressively than accidental ingestion. Ninety-six percent noted that patients with RIFBI had psychiatric comorbidities. Providers at academic medical centers reported referring to behavioral health more than those in other settings. Conclusion: Most gastroenterologists surveyed reported encountering RFBI several times a year and in patients with psychiatric comorbidities. Greater likelihood of adverse outcomes associated with endoscopy was reported. Most reported referral to behavioral health and few had RIFBI management protocols.

Methods: A new CR2032 BB and artificial saliva were placed in a fresh pig esophagus with the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN); the negative electrode faced the nerve in the experimental group, while the positive electrode faced the nerve in the control group. The pH values of the intra- and extraesophageal walls were measured simultaneously. Pathological examination was performed after the esophagus and nerves were damaged. Results: After BB ingestion, the pH near the intraesophageal negative electrode increased rapidly, reaching 11.5 at 30 min and over 14 at 6 h, while the extraesophageal pH did not change at 1 h and began to accelerate after 2 h, reaching 10 at 6 h. After 6 h of exposure, the pathological section showed that the structure of the mucosa, submucosa, and muscle layer were destroyed; chromatin in the nucleus faded, and part of the nerve bundle in the adventitia had liquefaction necrosis. Conclusion: The basic mechanism of vocal cord paralysis caused by BB ingestion is that the OH(−) generated by the electrolytic reaction of the negative electrode penetrates the esophageal wall and corrodes the RLN, which may be the cause of vocal cord paralysis caused by BB ingestion without esophageal perforation.",,"Button battery,Chemical injury,Foreign body,Vocal cord paralysis","","hydroxide, saliva substitute","chemical injury, foreign body aspiration, vocal cord paralysis (complication)","animal experiment, animal model, animal tissue, article, chemical reaction, chromatin, controlled study, disease simulation, esophagus, esophagus injury, experimental paralysis, human, laryngeal nerve, liquefactive necrosis, nerve injury, nonhuman, pH measurement, pig, tissue injury",,,,,"hydroxide (14280-30-9)",,"Otorhinolaryngology (11), Clinical and Experimental Biochemistry (29)",,"English","English",,38286078,L2030074220,10.1016/j.ijporl.2024.111872,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2024.111872","https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2030074220&from=export","https://libkey.io/libraries/1675/openurl?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=18728464&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.ijporl.2024.111872&atitle=Animal+study%3A+Basic+mechanism+of+vocal+cord+paralysis+caused+by+button+battery+ingestion+in+children&stitle=Int.+J.+Pediatr.+Otorhinolaryngol.&title=International+Journal+of+Pediatric+Otorhinolaryngology&volume=177&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Zhang&aufirst=Fengzhen&auinit=F.&aufull=Zhang+F.&coden=IPOTD&isbn=&pages=-&date=2024&auinit1=F&auinitm=","Copyright 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

In previous publications, it has been argued that hospitals might reduce the need for endoscopy by offering such patients a paid position to discourage foreign body ingestions. However, the game-theoretical analysis offered in the literature was based on a static game which did not justify the relevant equilibrium. To obtain the actual goal of keeping the patient away from foreign body ingestion, we consider a repeated game with an infinite horizon.

The diagnosis of intestinal perforation following blister ingestion is often delayed because of an unreliable history and nonspecific clinical presentation. The purpose of this case report is to raise awareness about a rare but difficult diagnosis and its importance in avoiding potentially fatal events. Case Reports: Herein, we describe successful cases of surgical and endoscopic removal after blister ingestion. The first case was that of a polymorbid 75-year-old man who presented with acute onset of abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant and epigastric regions. No indication of the cause was observed on initial computed tomography (CT). The patient developed an acute abdomen, and emergency laparotomy was performed, during which 2 small perforations were observed in the terminal ileum, and an empty tablet blister was retrieved. The second patient was a 55-year-old man who presented with a considerable lack of awareness. On the initial CT, a subdural hematoma, aspiration, and an unidentified foreign body in the stomach were observed. Gastroscopy was performed after emergency craniotomy. In addition to the initial foreign body, a second object, which had gone unnoticed on the initial CT, was found and removed from the esophagus.

It is induced by internal redistribution, decreased intestinal absorption, or urinary wasting. We present a case of multifactorial severe hypophosphatemia in the setting of chronic alcoholism and presumed refeeding syndrome. Case Description: A 69 year old male with a history of alcohol use disorder presented to the ED with generalized muscle weakness, recurrent falls and confusion. He reported consuming 2 bottles of wine daily for several years, with his last drink 24 hours prior to presentation. He reported a history of caloric restriction with intentional weight loss followed by a recent increase in caloric intake in the preceding week. His initial presentation was consistent with sepsis from contained sigmoid perforation due to foreign body ingestion, likely a chicken bone. Labs revealed phosphorus < 1, potassium 2.0, magnesium 1.4, lactate 8.5, WBC 6.1 with 34% band neutrophils, mild alkalosis (venous pH 7.43), pCO(2) 42, HCO(3) 24. He was admitted to the ICU and received volume resuscitation, IV antibiotics, management of alcohol withdrawal, intravenous phosphate, potassium and magnesium. Repeat labs showed improved phosphorus to 1.9, however serum corrected calcium decreased from 9.5 to 7.5 mg/dL. He continued to receive further repletion of electrolytes with eventual normalization. Discussion: The etiology of this patient's severe hypophosphatemia was multifactorial from chronic alcoholism and refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome was likely present in this case given the patient's malnutrition and weight loss with recent significantly increased caloric intake resulting in severe hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. His generalized muscle weakness can be explained by alcoholism and severe electrolyte derangements. Fortunately, he did not develop respiratory failure which is a complication of severe hypophosphatemia as a result of decreased intracellular ATP. For patients with severe hypophosphatemia (< 1 mg/dL), IV phosphate repletion is recommended with level monitoring every six hours. This patient developed hypocalcemia in the setting of phosphate repletion, which is a known complication and should be monitored closely.",,,"","antibiotic agent, calcium, electrolyte, lactic acid, magnesium, phosphate, phosphorus, potassium","hypophosphatemia","adult, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, alcoholism, alkalosis, body weight loss, caloric intake, caloric restriction, carbon dioxide tension, case report, clinical article, complication, conference abstract, confusion, diagnosis, drug therapy, foreign body, human, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, intensive care unit, intestine absorption, intravenous drug administration, leukocyte count, male, malnutrition, middle aged, muscle weakness, neutrophil, pH, phosphate blood level, refeeding syndrome, respiratory failure, resuscitation, sepsis",,,,,"calcium (7440-70-2, 14092-94-5), lactic acid (113-21-3, 50-21-5), magnesium (7439-95-4), phosphate (14066-19-4, 14265-44-2), phosphorus (7723-14-0), potassium (7440-09-7)",,"",,"English","English",,,L645708271,10.1681/asn.0000000000000448,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1681/asn.0000000000000448","https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L645708271&from=export","https://libkey.io/libraries/1675/openurl?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=10466673&id=doi:10.1681%2Fasn.0000000000000448&atitle=A+Case+of+Multifactorial+Severe+Hypophosphatemia&stitle=J.+Am.+Soc.+Nephrol.&title=Journal+of+the+American+Society+of+Nephrology&volume=35&issue=&spage=1274&epage=&aulast=Murphy&aufirst=Andrew&auinit=A.&aufull=Murphy+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1274-&date=2024&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Copyright 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

When unwitnessed, it poses therapeutic and diagnostic challenges especially in the presence of pre-existing anatomical pathology. We aim to analyze the clinical course, management, and outcome of children with impacted esophageal FBs. Methods: Retrospective chart review (Jan 2000–Feb 2018) recruiting children with impacted esophageal FBs. FBs in cricopharynx and those that moved to stomach were excluded. Investigations/management were based on underlying anatomical pathology, duration of impaction, and difficult FBs. Clinical details, management, and outcomes were collated. Results: Of 86 children, N1 = 31 had identifiable predisposing anatomic pathology and N2 = 55 had impactions in normal esophagus or difficult FBs. N1 group presented early (42 months), had recurrent impactions (1–6), and needed multiple dilatations (0–8) and longer follow-up (avg 35 months). Food matter was commonest impaction. Many had persistent symptoms. N2 group had commonly coin impactions and strictures developed in long standing or corrosive FBs. Most were asymptomatic. Conclusion: Abnormal esophageal anatomy predisposes to impaction with organic food bolus. Age of presentation is earlier with recurrent impactions requiring multiple dilatations/surgery and longer follow-up. Metallic FBs commonly impact in normal esophagus and are often innocuous. Atypical/multiple FBs may mirror an underlying psychiatric illness.",,"Dilatation,Esophageal,Foreign body,Impacted,Stricture","","organic matter","esophagus foreign body (surgery), impacted esophageal foreign body (surgery)","airway obstruction, alligator forceps, aspiration pneumonia, balloon catheter, balloon catheterization, child, clinical outcome, coughing, cricopharyngeus muscle, disease course, dysphagia, electric battery, endoscopic biopsy, erythema, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, esophagoscopy, esophagus anastomosis, esophagus atresia, esophagus dilatation, esophagus diverticulosis, esophagus stenosis (surgery), esophagus ulcer, failure to thrive, female, fever, flexible esophagoscope, follow up, gag reflex, gastroesophageal junction, gastroesophageal reflux, gastrostomy, hematemesis, human, human tissue, hydrothorax, hypersalivation, hypotension, invasive ventilation, laparotomy, laryngoscope, laryngoscopy, lower respiratory tract infection, Mac Gill forcep, major clinical study, male, medical record review, operating room, organic food, otorhinolaryngology forceps, pediatric anesthesia, peritonitis, pneumonia, psychological counseling, recurrent disease, recurrent infection, respiratory distress, retching, retrospective study, review, safety pin, shock, stridor, thoracotomy, thorax radiography, tracheoesophageal fistula, vomiting, wheezing",,,"Mac Gill forcep",,,,"Otorhinolaryngology (11), Pediatrics and Pediatric Surgery (7)",,"English","English",,36617341,L2021000364,10.1007/s00383-022-05360-3,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00383-022-05360-3","https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2021000364&from=export","https://libkey.io/libraries/1675/openurl?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=14379813&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00383-022-05360-3&atitle=Impacted+esophageal+foreign+bodies+in+children&stitle=Pediatr.+Surg.+Int.&title=Pediatric+Surgery+International&volume=39&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Raju&aufirst=Rajkiran+S.&auinit=R.S.&aufull=Raju+R.S.&coden=PSUIE&isbn=&pages=-&date=2023&auinit1=R&auinitm=S","Copyright 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Often, patients with psychiatric conditions repeatedly ingest foreign bodies, leading to frequent emergency department visits. Standardised management guidelines are lacking, resulting in high hospitalisation rates, interventions, and complications. This study focuses on recent DFBI cases at our institution, providing insights into this complex condition and holistic management. Methods: Patients admitted by the surgical team at Croydon University Hospital between 2017 and 2023 with DFBI were included. Data on demographics, clinical presentation, investigations, and management were collected. Complications, hospitalisations, interventions, and cost analysis were recorded. Results: Eight patients presented a total of 52 times. The incidence of DFBI increased over time. Swallowed objects included knives, needles, magnets, glass, batteries, pencils, gloves, lighters, and screws. Each patient underwent an average of 21 X-rays, 2 CT scans, and 3 OGDs. Eleven laparotomies and 1 laparoscopy were performed. The average length of stay was 44.5 days. Complications included pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, enterotomy, hernia, and infection. The average cost per patient was £30,866.25. Conclusions: DFBI poses a significant burden on healthcare systems. Patients face radiation exposure and repeated invasive interventions, necessitating a comprehensive approach. Understanding DFBI from a biopsychosocial and ethical perspective is crucial. A multidisciplinary team should be involved early, with clear goals. Further research is needed for optimal management pathways.",,,"","","swallow (bird)","adult, clinical article, complication, computer assisted tomography, conference abstract, controlled study, cost benefit analysis, emergency ward, female, foreign body, health care system, human, incidence, intestine surgery, laparotomy, length of stay, lung embolism, male, mental disease, multidisciplinary team, pneumonia, practice guideline, radiation exposure, university hospital, X ray",,,,,,,"",,"English","English",,,L643049187,10.1093/bjs/znad348.067,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bjs/znad348.067","https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L643049187&from=export","https://libkey.io/libraries/1675/openurl?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=13652168&id=doi:10.1093%2Fbjs%2Fznad348.067&atitle=Hard+to+swallow%2C+hard+to+treat&stitle=Br.+J.+Surg.&title=British+Journal+of+Surgery&volume=110&issue=&spage=viii24&epage=&aulast=Ishak&aufirst=Athanasius&auinit=A.&aufull=Ishak+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=viii24-&date=2023&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Copyright 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The aim of this study is to describe the profile of inmates who have ingested foreign bodies, to determine the nature of these foreign bodies and to specify their management. Materials and Methods: Our retrospective and descriptive study focused' on 13 inmates having ingested' 47 foreign bodies and who consulted the emergency of our department over a 5-year period from January 2018 to July 2023. Results: The study population consisted of 12 men and one woman with an average age of 32 years (24 years-47 years). Foreign bodies ingested by inmates were dominated by batteries (59.52%) followed by lighters (19.04%). The majoritý of foreign bodies were, at the time of discovery, located mainly in the stomach (6 cases) and colon (4 cases). Ingestion resulted in epigastric pain (3 cases), externalized gastrointestinal bleeding with epigastralgia (2 cases), and no symptoms (8 cases). Of the 13 cases of foreign body ingestion, 6 patients underwent endoscopic extraction in the gastroenterology department. Extraction was by diathermic loop, dormia loop and endoscopic basket. Successful extraction was achieved in 4 cases (66.66%), and unsuccessful extraction in 2 cases (33.33%). Only one inmate required surgical extraction, and in 6 patients the elimination of foreign bodies in the stool was spontaneous under medical supervision. Conclusion: Foreign body ingestion is frequent and voluntary in the prison environment. It is characterized by the multiplicity of foreign bodies. The rate of successful extraction of ingested foreign bodies in our practice is satisfactory, requiring an experienced endoscopist to perform the extraction without complications and avoid recourse to surgery. Education of the prison population is important, and psychological follow-up is essential.",,,"","","correctional facility, foreign body, ingestion","adult, aged, clinical article, complication, conference abstract, endoscopist, epigastric pain, female, follow up, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, human, male, prisoner, retrospective study, surgery",,,,,,,"",,"English","English",,,L643178871,10.5152/tjg.2023.101123,"http://dx.doi.org/10.5152/tjg.2023.101123","https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L643178871&from=export","https://libkey.io/libraries/1675/openurl?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=21485607&id=doi:10.5152%2Ftjg.2023.101123&atitle=Ingestion+of+Foreign+Bodies+in+Prisons%3A+How+Should+They+Be+Managed%3A+Study+of+13+Cases&stitle=Turk.+J.+Gastroenterol.&title=Turkish+Journal+of+Gastroenterology&volume=34&issue=&spage=S93&epage=&aulast=Mezouari&aufirst=Fatima+Azzahra&auinit=F.A.&aufull=Mezouari+F.A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S93-&date=2023&auinit1=F&auinitm=A","Copyright 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
