That chest wounds occur frequently and are of considerable importance can be seen from Table I, which analyses the frequency and the fatality rates of chest injuries in the recent wars.

In forward areas the surgery of chest injuries is confined to emergency measures, such as the closing of sucking pneumothoraces and the relieving of tension pneumothoraces, etc., and is undertaken by the general surgeon, whilst the definitive surgery is performed by specialist surgeons at the base chest centres. Likewise, radiology in the forward areas is generally confined to scout films of the thorax, the special investigations being left to the radiologist at the special chest centres.

In modern warfare, the radiological investigation of a chest wound falls into two main classes:

(a) At Advanced Surgical Centres and C.C.S's

Films at this stage will generally be in the nature of scout films, to give a general estimation of the intra-thoracic damage. There is little place for complicated radiological examinations at this stage. Many of the patients are severely ill, often with multiple wounds, and as the portability of the apparatus (W.D. 85/15 unit) used of necessity limits its output, recourse to short distance technique must be made.

Using this technique, the anode film distance may be reduced to 30 in. or even less, to eliminate movement. The resulting distortion is no bar to correct interpretation as the lesion, unfortunately, is seldom minimal, whilst on the other hand the slightest movement may obscure even the most massive of lesions.",,

The medicolegal literature contains a number of references to esophageal injury. Certain excerpts dealing with several types of potential actions are extracted: (1) suits to recover damages for esophageal perforation in which negligent endoscopy was claimed; (2) suits following endoscopic accidents in which lack of informed consent was claimed; and (3) suits for professional liability based on misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis, or wrong treatment of esophageal perforation.
This review considers all possible modes of esophageal injury, based on a schema originally published in 1954 and more recently modified in 1970. For each category of injury there are detailed discussions of diagnosis and treatment. The best available knowledge of present-day modalities has been based on a survey of the literature for the past decade. When diverse methods of treatment were encountered, we have made comments consistent with our personal experience, when appropriate.",,

Pulmonary Aspiration Continues To Be An Ever...,"The term pulmonary aspiration complex represents the various types of pulmonary aspiration based on the nature of the material aspirated. Pulmonary aspiration continues to be an ever-threatening clinical problem even though knowledge of lung defense mechanisms and predisposing factors of aspiration has been advanced to a point which allows identification of patients at risk of suffering pulmonary aspiration. The identification of patients at risk however has not permitted adequate preventive measures from being exercised. This problem persists in part because few of the predisposing factors are reversible or controllable to a degree which would preclude pulmonary aspiration. In addition, the clinical diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration is more often tentative than absolute and based on the clinical setting and changes demonstrated on serial chest radiographs. This situation emphasizes the role of the radiologist and his knowledge of radiographic findings in pulmonary aspiration in suggesting the diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration. The diagnosis may then be confirmed by additional chest radiographs or by bronchoscopy and the retrieval of the aspirated material.
An understanding of the pathophysiology of the types of pulmonary aspiration serves to increase the awareness of certain pulmonary complications from aspiration, to select appropriate diagnostic studies, and to institute specific therapy. However, the nature of the material aspirated by a patient may not be obvious initially unless the episode is witnessed and may only be determined in retrospect in some cases. Thus, radiologists play a primary role in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration. Frequently, radiologists must integrate the chest radiographic findings of pulmonary aspirationthe distribution, types of parenchymal opacities, and the expected temporal changes in these opacities, with the patient's clinical situation to establish a diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration (Tables 5, 6).
Until recently, therapy of pulmonary aspiration was standardized, pragmatic, and frequently lacked an understanding of the distinct types of pulmonary aspiration. Controversy still surrounds some aspects of therapy. Perhaps, with additional efforts.",,

If these densities were found in the proximal ascending colon or upper gastrointestinal tract, the diagnosis was almost assured.

Six percent of patients exhibited complications suggested on serial radiographs, proving the necessity for follow-up studies until complete expulsion or removal of the foreign body.

suspected only on review of the lateral cervical
radiograph. In a previous report, failure to ini-

resulted in an endoscopic failure to clear the
esophagus. The technical aspects of Foley ex-
traction are reviewed along with the controver-
sy surrounding the procedure. Series totaling
294 cases document a cumulative success rate
of 85% without significant complications. The
technique, when performed by airway experts,
is concluded to be a viable alternative to endo-
scopic removal. Lateral films, fluoroscopic ex-
traction, and barium studies in select cases are
recommended as safeguards against missing non-
obvious foreign bodies of the esophagus.",,

Children with asymptomatic esophageal coins were allowed less than 24 hours to pass the coin to the stomach. Thirty children had esophageal coins; of these, 9 (30%) were asymptomatic.

(""chronic group""), uncertain in four (""uncertain group""); and the foreign body was
a broncholith in five patients (""broncholith group""). In the chronic and uncertain
groups, no precipitating factor was found and bone was the most common foreign
body. In the chronic group, a choking history was obtained before bronchoscopy
in only 15 patient.
Clinical manifestations and roentgenograms were nonspecific in most cases, except
in the acute group. In the chronic group, the mean duration of residence of the
foreign body was 25.8 months. The diagnosis was delayed due to absence of a
choking history and invisibility of the foreign body on chest films in 12, due to
patient's ignorance in 14, due to physician's ignorance in 1, and due to previous
unsuccessful retrieval attempts in 2 patients.
The main indication for bronchoscopy in the acute group was a choking history
or a visible foreign body on the chest film. In the chronic group, a choking histo-
ry or conditions leading to ""suspicion of an endobronchial lesion"" were the main
indications. The foreign body was removed with a fibreoptic bronchoscope in over
90% of patients. It is concluded that the most important diagnostic factor is a high
clinical index of suspicion and that flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy provides a valu-
able therapeutic option in selected conditions.",,

While feeding they transmit important diseases, among which are cowdriosis and East coast fever. It is generally known that pathogens after being ingested with the blood by the tick, move through the gut and reach the salivary gland where they are injected in a host with the saliva of the tick during feeding. Hardly anything is known on tick immune system. The goal of this work was to study the immune system of both A. variegatum and R. appendiculatus. Five types of haemocytes were found in both tick species. They were plasmatocytes, granulocytes, spherular cells, prohaemocytes and oenocytoids. There was no significant difference between total haemocyte count in adults and nymphs of A. variegatum and adults of R. appendiculatus. However total haemocyte count in infected ticks were significantly (P<0.05 ) higher than non-infected ones. Differential haemocyte count in non-infected showed a significant predominance of spherules and granular cells. The same trend was observed in ticks infected with bacteria. Tick haemocytes reacted to the presence of foreign bodies like bacteria, fungi and parasitoids by forming nodules or granulomma. All the ticks injected with Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana died within 5 to 10 days. None of the infected engorged females layed eggs. None of the engorged nymphs molted. Encapsulation was demonstrated using araldite as implant. Lysozyme activity was induced by injecting bacteria. Bacillus thuringiensis was observed to have induced more lysozyme activity than other bacteria. The tick parasitoid Ixodiphagus hookeri laid eggs in all the stages of both A. variegatum and R. appendiculatus but completed its development in the nymph of A. variegatum despite the cellular and humoral reactions of the host. The parasitoid goes through 3 larval stages, pupates, molt and emerges generally through one hole after 4 to 6 weeks post-infestation, leaving a dried empty cuticle.",,

A minority of FB ingestions are not identified for weeks to years and present significant problems for retrieval. The purpose of this study was to describe the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies needed to care for children who have chronic esophageal FBs.
Methods: Five children were identified as having retained esophageal FBs 2 months to 2 years after ingestion. During the same 3-year period, 100 children who had acute FBs were identified and had their foreign bodies removed endoscopically. The average age of the children was 3 years (range, 2.4 to 3.5).
Results: The average age of the five children identified in this study was 3 years. The items ingested included coins, a heart pendant, a clothespin spring, and a toy soldier. Complications from chronically retained foreign bodies were bronchoesophageal fistula, mediastinitis, esophageal diverticulum, and lobar atelectasis. One patient died from an aortoesophageal fistula. In all children, endoscopic removal was attempted. Barium esophagram was then performed, and foreign bodies were eventually removed via right thoracotomy.
Conclusions: Long-retained esophageal FBs are extremely morbid and life threatening. History most often identifies excess salivation, new onset asthma, and/or recurrent upper respiratory infections. Three diagnostic adjuncts are helpful in identifying the presence of a long retained FB: (1) Chest x-ray (PA and lateral), (2) barium swallow, and (3) esophagoscopy. Indications for thoracotomy for removal of foreign body include (1) Poor endoscopic visualization of FB because of inflammatory tissue and (2) Herald bleeding during endoscopy.",,

METHODS: For children under 15 years, all Victorian public hospital admissions, July 1987 to June 1995, due to asphyxiation or 'foreign body entering through other orifice' (which includes ingestions), were reviewed. Emergency department presentations due to asphyxiation and foreign body ingestion provided information on circumstances of, and the type of foreign bodies involved in the injuries. RESULTS: The childhood average annual admission rate for asphyxiation was 15.1 per 100,000. Food related asphyxiation peaked in infants under 1 year, and declined to low levels by 3 years. The main foods involved were nuts, carrot, apple, and candy. The rate of non-food related asphyxiation was relatively constant to 3 years of age and then declined by 6 years. Mechanical suffocation was less common. The annual admission rate for 'foreign body entering through other orifice' was 31.7 per 100,000. These injuries peaked in 2-3 year olds then gradually declined. About 80% of these foreign body admissions were ingestions, with coins being the major object ingested. Admission rates for these causes remained constant over the eight years. Asphyxiation resulted in a higher proportion admitted and longer hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of suffocation and strangulation needs to focus on a safe sleeping environment and avoidance of ropes and cords, while foreign body asphyxiation and ingestion needs a focus on education of parents and child carers regarding age, appropriate food, risk of play with coins, and other small items. Legislation for toy small parts could be extended to those used by children up to the age of 5 years, and to other products marketed for children.

Study  Design: Prospective Study. Methods: Thirty-Four Patients With Oropharyngeal  Dysphagia Underwent Videoendoscopy Of Swallowing To Assess Pharyngeal Propulsion  As Pathologic Or Nonpathologic, And Aspiration. These Features Were Compared With  Those Found On Manometry And Videofluoroscopy, Which Were Considered As The  Reference Examinations. Sensitivity, Specificity, And Positive And Negative  Predictive Values Of Videoendoscopy Were Estimated, With Their 95% Confidence  Intervals. Results: A Total Agreement Between Videoendoscopy And Videofluoroscopy  Was Found In 76.4% Of Cases For Pharyngeal Propulsion And In 82.3% For  Aspiration. This Rate For Pharyngeal Propulsion Reached 82.3% Between  Videoendoscopy And Manometry. Moreover, In 24 Cases (70.5%) In Which  Videofluoroscopy And Manometry Agreed For Pharyngeal Propulsion, 22 Were Assessed  Similarly Through Fiberoscopy. When Using Fluoroscopy And Manometry As Reference  Examinations, Videoendoscopy Detected Nearly 90% (95% Confidence Interval [Ci] =  0.80, 1.0) Of Impaired Pharyngeal Propulsion. Concerning Aspiration, 70% (95% Ci  = 0.54, 0.85) Of Events Detected By Videoendoscopy Were Also Observed On  Videofluoroscopy. Sensitivity, Specificity, And Positive And Negative Predictive  Values Of Videoendoscopy Reached A Higher Rate (90% To 92.8%) When Agreement Was  Found Between Fluoroscopy And Manometry.

The authors prefer to initially attempt removal of smooth, radiopaque esophageal foreign bodies using the balloon technique and then proceed to rigid esophagoscopy if unsuccessful.
Methods: The authors reviewed their 7-year experience with this approach in 276 children with esophageal foreign bodies.
Results: One hundred seventy-three children underwent attempted balloon extraction, and 146 of these underwent successful removal with this method. Fifteen remained lodged in the esophagus and were subsequently removed by esophagoscopy, and 12 passed into the stomach and were observed. The only complication was one episode of epistaxis that resolved. Success of the balloon method was not related to patient age, foreign body duration, location, or presenting symptoms. The use of more than 5 minutes of fluoroscopy time was associated with a low likelihood of successful extraction.
Conclusion: The balloon extraction technique is a safe and effective alternative to rigid esophagoscopy for the removal of slected esophageal foreign bodies in children.",,

Early diagnosis and treatment can decrease morbidity and length of hospital stay in these children. Three cases of delayed diagnosis in children with bronchial (2) and esophageal (1) foreign bodies are presented. In dealing with young children it is important to maintain a high clinical suspicion of a foreign body and to perform a detailed history and physical examination. Options in radiographic analysis of the patient with a suspected foreign body, probable locations of the foreign body, and the likelihood of definitive radiographic findings are discussed. Importantly, a negative radiographic analysis does not rule out the presence of an aerodigestive tract foreign body. Two flow charts for the evaluation of patients who have possibly ingested or inhaled a foreign body are presented to aid the primary care physician in diagnosis.",,

The radio-opacity and the size of fixed and removable dental prostheses in an animal carcass was investigated. Prostheses were placed one at a time in the oro-laryngopharynx or in tho trachea and the esophagus. Lateral radiographs were taken for each prosthesis in site. The radio-opacity and size of the prostheses on the radiograph was graded. Most of the prostheses investigated were radio-opaque though the removable prostheses were more likely to be radiolucent and differ in size.

In The Remaining Patient, Aef Was Caused By Swallowing A Fishbone. In 6 Cases Involving True Aef With A Direct Communication Between The Aorta And Esophagus, Massive Exsanguinating Hematemesis Occurred. It Was Usually Preceded By Minor Sentinel Bleeding, Two Patients Presented Esophagoparaprosthetic Fistula (Eppf). One Patient Presented Primary Aef That Was Contained By A Large Thrombus In The Communication. The Clinical Picture In These 3 Patients Involved Severe Sepsis Without Hemorrhage. Results: Two Patients Died As A Result Of Massive Hemorrhage Before Assessment And Surgical Treatment Could Be Undertaken. One 77-Year-Old Woman Presenting Eppf Refused To Undergo Surgery And Died Because Of Infection. The Remaining 6 Patients Underwent Surgical Treatment With Various Outcomes. One Man Died During Thoracotomy Caused By Exsanguinating Hemorrhage. One Woman Presenting Eppf Was Treated By Exclusion Followed By Ascending Aorta To Abdominal Aorta Bypass Grafting, Removal Of The Prosthesis, Esophageal Exclusion, And Directed Esophageal Fistula. She Died Of Infection. The Other 4 Patients Were Treated By In Situ Aortic Allograft Replacement. The Damaged Esophagus Was Repaired By Using The Tha1 Technique In 1 Patient. In The Remaining 3 Cases Subtotal Esophagectomy Was Performed In Association With Cervical Esophagostomy, Ligation Of The Abdominal Esophagus, Gastrostomy, And Jejunostomy. One Patient Died Of Sepsis During The First 24 Hours After The Operation. The Other 3 Patients Underwent Secondary Esophagoplasty And Survived With No Further Sign Of Infection. Mean Duration Of Follow-Up In The Survivor Group Was 53 Months (Range, 15-95 Months). Overall 6 Patients, Including 3 That Did Not Undergo Surgical Treatment, Died And 3 Patients Survived. Conclusion: Our Experience Confirms That Aef Is A Rare But Catastrophic Disorder. In Situ Allograft Replacement Usually In Association With Subtotal Esophagectomy Appears To Be An Excellent Salvage Modality Whenever Emergency Surgery Is Feasible.",,,

Patients And Methods: As Part Of A Larger Study Of  The Effects Of Retained Lead Bullets On Blood Lead, A Retrospective Review Of  Study Findings Was Completed On 5 Of 8 Patients Who Sustained Injuries To The  Maxillofacial Region. These 5 Patients Were Recruited Into The Larger Study  Within 11 Days Of Injury And Showed A Penetration Path For The Projectile That  Engaged The Upper Aerodigestive Tract. All Subjects Were Recruited From Patients  Presenting For Care Of Their Gunshot Injuries To A Large Inner-City Trauma Center  With A Retained Bullet Resulting From A Gunshot Injury. An Initial Blood Lead  Level Was Measured For All Recruited Patients And Repeated 1 To 17 Weeks Later.  Medical History Was Taken Along With A Screening And Risk Factor Questionnaire To  Determine Other Potential Or Actual Sources (Occupational/Recreational) Of Lead  Exposure. (109)Cd K-Shell X-Ray Fluorescence Determinations Of Bone Lead Were  Completed To Determine Past Lead Exposure Not Revealed By Medical History And  Risk Factor Questionnaire. Radiographs Taken Of The Abdomen And Chest, Required  As A Part Of The Patient'S Hospital Care, Were Retrospectively Reviewed For Signs  Of Metallic Fragments Along The Aerodigestive Tract. Results: All 5 Patients  Retained Multiple Lead Pellets Or Fragments At The Site Of Injury, Sustained  Fractures Of The Facial Bones, And Showed Increases In Blood Lead. Three Of The 5  Study Subjects Who Sustained Maxillofacial Gunshot Injuries Involving The Mouth,  Nose, Or Throat Region Showed Metallic Densities Along The Gastrointestinal Tract  Indicative Of Ingested Bullet Fragments. Each Patient With Ingested Bullet  Fragments Showed Rapid Elevation Of Blood Lead Exceeding 25 Microg/Dl And  Sustained Increases Well Beyond The Time When All Ingested Fragments Were  Eliminated. A 3-Year Follow-Up On These 3 Patients Showed Significantly Sustained  Elevation Of Blood Lead But Less Than That Observed During The Initial 6 Months  After Injury. None Of The 5 Study Subjects Showed Any Evidence Of Metallic  Foreign Bodies Within The Tracheobronchial Regions Indicative Of Aspiration.  Conclusion: Ingestion Of Lead Fragments Can Result From Gunshot Injuries To The  Maxillofacial Region And May Substantially Contribute To A Rapid Increase In  Blood Lead Level. Prompt Diagnosis And Elimination Of Ingested Lead Fragments Are  Essential Steps Necessary To Prevent Lead Being Absorbed From The  Gastrointestinal Tract. Increased Blood Lead In Victims After Gunshot Injuries  Must Be Fully Evaluated For All Potential Sources, Including Recent Environmental  Exposure, Absorption Of Lead From Any Remaining Bullets In Body Tissues, And The  Possibility Of Mobilization Of Lead From Long-Term Body Stores Such As Bone.",,,

Material And Methods: A Prospective Study Was Performed On 36 Patients (26 F, 10 M, Mean Age 70 Years) With A History Of Foreign Body Impaction. All Had Negative Findings At Indirect Laryngoscopy. Radiologic Assessment Included Unenhanced Helical Ct And A Barium Contrast Study. Patients With Positive Findings Were Taken To Esophagoscopy. All Patients Had A Posterior Clinical Surveillance. Results: Twenty Patients Had Both Normal Ct And Barium Study And Satisfactory Clinical Outcome. In 12 Patients A Foreign Body Was Noted In The Cervical Esophagus By Ct, Barium Study, And Endoscopy. In One Patient A Fish Bone Was Detected By Ct (And Not By Barium) Confirmed With Esophagoscopy. Another Patient Bad A Fish Bone Esophageal Perforation Which Was Observed Only By Ct And Confirmed At Surgery. Two Patients With Normal Barium And Endoscopy Presented A False-Positive Ct Result. Conclusion: Barium Swallow Is Currently The First Radiologic Study, But May Involve A Risk Of Aspiration And Can Impede A Subsequent Esophagoscopy. Esophagoscopy Is An Invasive Technique With A Certain Risk Of Serious Complications That Can Be Avoided With A Satisfactory Radiologic Assessment. Ct Is Easy, Fast, Has 100% Sensitivity And Is Therefore The First Choice Technique For Diagnosing Suspected Upper Esophageal Foreign Bodies Not Expected To Be Visible On Plain Radiographs.",,,

Purpose: To Establish Normal Cervical Spinal Dimensions And Analyze The  Differences Observed Between Men And Women, And Between Reports Using Subjects Of  Different Ethnicity. Study Design/Setting: Observational. Patient Sample: Forty  Men And 40 Women Of Chinese Descent With No History Or Symptoms Of Neck Pathology  Selected From Patients Presenting To The Emergency Department For Foreign Body  Ingestion. Outcome Measures: Measurements Of The Sagittal Developmental Diameter  (Sdd) And Vertebral Body Diameter (Vb) On The Lateral Cervical Radiograph With  Calculation Of Sdd/Vb (Torg Ratio). Methods: Lateral Radiographs Of The Cervical  Spine Were Taken In A Standardized Manner With A 180-Cm Film-To-Tube Distance.  Comparison Was Made Between Genders In The Study Population And With Previous  Reports On Subjects Of Different Ethnicity. Results: The Sdd Was Narrowest At The  C4 Level In Both Men And Women. Women Had Smaller Sdds At All Levels Of The  Cervical Spine. Female Vbs Were Of Sizes Similar To Their Corresponding Sdds,  Whereas Men Had Larger Vbs.

The Vast Majority Of Pediatric Ingestions Are  Accidental; Increasing Incidence Of Intentional Ingestions Starts In The  Adolescent Age Group. In The United States, The Most Common Pediatric Foreign  Bodies Ingested Are Coins, Followed By A Variety Of Other Objects, Including  Toys, Toy Parts, Sharp Objects, Batteries, Bones, And Food. In Adolescents And  Adults, Meat Or Food Impactions Are The Most Common Accidental Foreign Body  Ingestion. Esophageal Pathology Underlies Most Cases Of Food Impaction.  Management Of Foreign Body Ingestions Varies Based On The Object Ingested, Its  Location, And The Patient'S Age And Size. Esophageal Foreign Bodies As A Group  Require Early Intervention Because Of Their Potential To Cause Respiratory  Symptoms And Complications, Esophageal Erosions, Or Even An Aortoesophageal  Fistula. Ingested Batteries That Lodge In The Esophagus Require Urgent Endoscopic  Removal Even In The Asymptomatic Patient Due To The High Risk Of Complications.  Sharp Foreign Bodies Increase The Foreign Body Complication Rate From Less Than  1% To 15% To 35%, Except For Straight Pins, Which Usually Follow A Relatively  Benign Course Unless Multiple Pins Are Ingested. Magnets Are Increasingly  Ingested, Due To Their Ubiquitous Nature And The Perception That They Do Not Pose  A Risk. Ingestion Of Multiple Magnets Creates A Significant Risk Of Obstruction,  Perforation, And Fistula Development.

When Swallowed, Open Safety Pins Are Mostly Found Within The Esophagus Or Stomach, And  They Cannot Be Easily Removed By Rigid Esophagogastroscopy. Our Aim Was To  Evaluate The Removal Of Safety Pins Using Flexible Endoscopy In Infants.  Materials And Methods: We Evaluated The Cases Of 7 Infants Who Had Ingested Open  Safety Pins Between 2001 And 2004. In All The Patients, The Primary Diagnostic  Tool Was A Direct X-Ray Of The Neck, Chest, And Abdomen. In All Cases, The Safety  Pins Were Removed By Flexible Esophagogastroduo-Denoscopy. Clinical Records For  The Cases Were Reviewed. Results: Four Of The Open Safety Pins Were Lodged In The  Esophagus, Two In The Stomach, And One In The Duodenum. One Infant Had A Safety  Pin Lodged In The Esophagus With The Pin'S Open End Pointed Caudally; The Pin Was  Held With The Endoscopic Forceps By Its Tail End And Removed. Three Safety Pins  In The Esophagus Had Their Open Ends Pointing Cephalad; These Were Held By Their  Tail Ends Using The Endoscopic Forceps And Pushed Into The Stomach. Then They  Were Rotated In The Stomach And Removed Tail End First. The Safety Pins Located  In The Stomach Or Duodenum Were Also Removed Similarly.

Most Commonly, Fb Are Introduced Through The Anal Passage Or  Reach The Rectum After Oral Ingestion. We Describe Our Experience In The  Diagnosis And Treatment Of Fb Retained In The Rectum. Method: From 1997 To 2004,  Data Were Collected Prospectively In 30 Patients (20 Men And 10 Women; Median Age  42.5 Years). Extraction Method, Size And Type Of Object, And Postextraction  Evolution Were Reviewed. Results: The Fb Was Introduced Anally In 16 Cases And By  Oral Ingestion In 14. Principal Associated Factors Were: Mental Disorder In 11,  Penitentiary Confinement In Two, And Drug And Alcohol Intake In Two. Recent  Sexual Activity Had Taken Place In 14 Cases. The Size And Nature Of The Fb Were  Varied. The Most Frequent Symptom Was Constipation With Or Without Pelvic Or Anal  Discomfort (N = 23, 77%). Treatment Consisted Of Spontaneous Ejection (N = 2),  Digital Extraction With Or Without Enemas (N = 10), Digital Extraction Under  Local/Regional Anaesthesia After Fragmentation (N = 11) And Regional Exploratory  Laparotomy Under General Anaesthesia (N = 7).

diseases, changed laws, and single-handedly launched the era of
antibiotics. This incredible discovery was sulfa, the first antibiotic. In The
Demon Under the Microscope, Thomas Hager chronicles the dramatic
history of the drug that shaped modern medicine.
Sulfa saved millions of livesamong them those of Winston Churchill and
Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr.but its real effects are even more far reaching.
Sulfa changed the way new drugs were developed, approved, and sold;
transformed the way doctors treated patients; and ushered in the era of modern
medicine. The very concept that chemicals created in a lab could cure disease
revolutionized medicine, taking it from the treatment of symptoms and
discomfort to the eradication of the root cause of illness.
A strange and colorful story, The Demon Under the Microscope illuminates the
vivid characters, corporate strategy, individual idealism, careful planning, lucky
breaks, cynicism, heroism, greed, hard work, and the central (though mistaken)
idea that brought sulfa to the world. This is a fascinating scientific tale with all the

It Brings Sophisticat Processes, Developing ...","For the growing number of critics concerned to trace the links among historical forces, psychic experience, and literary expression, the growth of trauma studies since the publication of Cathy Caruth's Unclaimed Experience (1996) offers an important opportunity for reflection. On one hand, the work in this field has been justly influential. It brings sophisticated psychoanalytic concepts to bear on collective processes, developing accounts of historical violence that are both socially specific and psychologically astute. These accounts are especially compelling when focused on what I call ""punctual"" traumas: historical events of such singularity, magnitude, and horror that they can be read as shocks that disable the psychic system. Thus, for example, in their readings of the Holocaust-the paradigmatic example for critics concerned with this kind of trauma-Caruth and others have helped us see how a historical moment might be experienced less as an ongoing set of processes that shape and are shaped by those living through them than as a punctual blow to the psyche that overwhelms its functioning, disables its defenses, and absents it from direct contact with the brutalizing event itself. Precisely because the violence suffered by Holocaust victims was so extreme, on this view, it affected those victims as a psychic concussion that short-circuited their capacity to ""process"" the traumatizing event as it took place. Traumas of this kind thus become accessible only in the mind's recursive attempts to master what it has in some sense failed to experience in the first instance. A punctual incursion on the mind, having ""dissociated"" consciousness from itself, installs an unprocessed memory-trace that returns unbidden, as delayed effect, in an effort to force the mind to digest this previously unclaimed kernel of experience.",,

Coins Are By Far The Most Common Ingested Foreign Bodies. When Ingested Coins Become Lodged In  The Esophagus, They May Cause Serious Complications If They Are Not Removed In A  Timely Manner. Endoscopic Removal Is The Preferred Treatment In Many Pediatric  Centers As Its Safety And Effectiveness Are Well Established. Objectives: We  Performed This Study To Evaluate Safety And Effectiveness Of An Alternative  Method Of Managing Esophageal Coins, Using Bougienage Technique. Methods:  Previously Healthy Children Presenting To The Local Emergency Room With  Uncomplicated, Witnessed Coin Ingestion Of Less Than 24 Hours Duration Were  Prospectively Recruited With An Intent-To-Treat Analysis. A Single Oral Passage  Of A Hurst Bougie Dilator Was Performed By A Gastroenterologist To Dislodge The  Esophageal Coin Into The Stomach. If Bougienage Was Successful (X-Ray Showing  Coin In The Stomach), Patients Were Discharged And Instructions Were Given For  Monitoring Stools Until Passage Of The Coin Through Anus Was Confirmed. If  Bougienage Was Unsuccessful, The Child Developed Symptoms At Any Time Or If A  Coin Remained Intragastric For 4 Weeks, Endoscopic Removal Was Planned. Children  Whose Parents Declined To Participate In The Bougienage Treatment Received The  Standard Endoscopic Removal And Their Hospital Records Were Used As Controls.  Results: A Total Of 10 Children Were Enrolled In This Study, With A Mean Age Of  3.2 Years (11 Mo To 10 Y), 6 Boys And 4 Girls. All Received Little Or No  Sedation. Nine Children (90%) Were Successfully Treated Using Bougienage, All Of  Whom Spontaneously Passed The Ingested Coins, With A Mean Duration Of 2.6 Days (1  To 7 D) Without Subsequent Intervention. A Single Case Failed Bougienage And  Underwent Endoscopic Removal. Three Children Declined Bougienage Treatment And  Underwent Endoscopic Removal. There Were No Reported Minor Or Major Adverse  Events With Any Of Our Cases. The Mean Health Care Cost For The Hospital Visit  For Bougienage Treatment Was $1210, Compared With $3100 For The Endoscopic  Removal (P<0.001). Furthermore, The Mean Time Spent In The Hospital From  Diagnosis To Discharge Was 2 Hours For Bougienage-Treated Patients Compared With  8 Hours For Endoscopic Treatment (P<0.001). Conclusions: Bougienage Of Impacted  Esophageal Coins Is An Effective, Safe, And More Economic Treatment Modality For  Selected Pediatric Patients With Uncomplicated Coin Ingestion. This Simple  Technique May Provide A Valuable Tool To Emergency Room Physicians Or Primary  Care Doctors Especially When Endoscopy Is Not Readily Available.",,,

The purpose of the study was to assess the percentage of patients in whom urgent endoscopic investigation revealed true foreign bodies in the upper GIT and to evaluate the success of emergency endoscopic procedures. Methods: The study includes patients in whom urgent endoscopic investigations of the upper GIT were performed in the period 1 January 1994 to 1 May 2008. Results: 8552 patients were investigated, average age 60.6 years (SD17.1 years, range 1106 years), with 3276 (38 %) females and 5276 males (62 %). In 69 patients (0.8 %), true foreign bodies were detected in the esophagus or stomach. In these patients a total of 90 endoscopic investigations were performed: in 65/69 patients (94.2%) the foreign bodies were removed endoscopically; in 4 (5.8 %) cases the endoscopic procedures were unsuccessful. Among the foreign bodies removed were a variety metal or plastic objects, such as coins, keys, screws, hooks, batteries, razor blades, needles, lighters, buttons, and parts of kitchen, toilet or writing utensils. In patients with successful endoscopic removal of the objects, no significant complications were noted. In 4 patients (4/69, 5.8 %) mild hemorrhages from the region of the esophagogastric junction were observed.

Since Opioid Dependence Treatment With Naltrexone Tablets Suffers From High Dropout Rates, Several Depot Injections And Implants Are Under Investigation. Sustained‐Release Formulations Are Claimed To Be Effective, But A Systematic Review Of The Literature Is Lacking. Objectives To Evaluate The Effectiveness Of Sustained‐Release Naltrexone For Opioid Dependence And Its Adverse Effects In Different Study Populations. Search Methods The Following Databases Were Searched From Their Inception To November 2007: Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Lilacs, Psycinfo, Isi Web Of Science, Trial Database At Http://Clinicaltrials.Gov, Available Nida Monographs, Cpdd And Aaap Conference Proceedings. The Reference Lists Of Identified Studies, Published Reviews And Relevant Web Sides Were Searched Manually. Study Authors And Drug Companies Were Contacted To Obtain Any Unpublished Material Or Missing Data. Selection Criteria To Evaluate Effectiveness Only Rcts Were Included. To Evaluate Safety, Any Clinical Trial Reporting Adverse Effects Was Assessed. Treatment Condition Was Extended To Include Alcohol Dependent Subjects And Healthy Volunteers. Data Collection And Analysis Reviewers Independently Evaluated The Reports, Rated Methodological Quality And Extracted Data. Analyses Were Performed Separately For Opioid Dependent, Alcohol Dependent And Healthy Participants. Main Results Foe Effectiveness, One Report Met Inclusion Criteria. Two Dosages Of Naltrexone Depot Injections (192 And 384 Mg) Were Compared To Placebo. High‐Dose Significantly Increased Days In Treatment Compared To Placebo (Wmd 21.00, 95% Ci 10.68 To 31.32, P<0.0001). High‐Dose Compared To Low‐Dose Significantly Increased Days In Treatment (Wmd 12.00, 95% Ci 1.69 To 22.31, P=0.02). Number Of Patients Retained In Treatment Did Not Show Significant Differences Between Groups. For Adverse Effects, Seventeen Reports Met Inclusion Criteria Analyses, Six Were Rcts. Side Effects Were Significantly More Frequent In Naltrexone Depot Groups Compared To Placebo. In Alcohol Dependent Samples Only, Adverse Effects Appeared To Be Significantly More Frequent In The Low‐Dose Naltrexone Depot Groups Compared To Placebo (Rr 1.18, 95% Ci 1.02 To 1.36, P=0.02). In The Opioid Dependent Sample, Group Differences Were Not Statistically Significant. Reports On Systematic Assessment Of Side Effects And Adverse Events Were Scarce. Authors' Conclusions There Is Insufficient Evidence To Evaluate The Effectiveness Of Sustained‐Release Naltrexone For Treatment Of Opioid Dependence.  For Naltrexone Injections, Administration Site‐Related Adverse Effects Appear To Be Frequent, But Of Moderate Intensity And Time Limited. For A Harm‐Benefit Evaluation Of Naltrexone Implants, More Data On Side Effects And Adverse Events Are Needed. Plain Language Summary People With Opioid Dependence Require Substantial Therapeutic Effort To Keep Them Drug Free. Their Use Of Illicit Opioids Can Be Reduced And Retention In Treatment Improved With Supervised Agonist Replacement Therapy With Methadone, Which Is A Highly Addictive Drug. Naltrexone Is A Long‐Acting, Opioid‐Antagonist That Blocks Heroin Effects. It Is Used To Prevent Relapse Of Both Opioid And Alcohol Dependence. Highly Motivated People Do Best With  Naltrexone. Most Opioid Users Are Sceptical About Treatment With Naltrexone Tablets And Many Drop Out Early On. Dropouts Can Be Reduced With Supervised Tablet Taking, Offering Incentives And Using Sustained‐Release Naltrexone  Such As Subcutaneous Implants Or Depot Injections.  There Is Insufficient Evidence From Randomised Controlled Trials To Evaluate The Effectiveness Of Sustained‐Release Naltrexone. In The One Controlled Study That Met Inclusion Criteria, 60 Outpatients Were Randomised To One Of Three Groups That Received Two Sequential Depot Injections Of Naltrexone (192 Or 384 Mg) Or Placebo Injections. The Mean Dropout Time Was 48 Days With High Dose Naltrexone Compared With 27 Days On Placebo; An Increase In  Treatment Of 21 Days (Range 11 To 31 Days). The Lower Depot Dose Gave A Lesser Benefit. The Number Retained In Treatment At Eight Weeks Did Not Show A Clear Difference And Ranged From A Mean Of 68% To 39% Of Participants In  The Different Groups. 'Wanting Heroin' Did Not Differ On Naltrexone But 'Needing Heroin' Scored Significantly Lower With Depot Naltrexone Compared To Placebo. The Most Prominent Adverse Effects Were General Symptoms Of  Fatigue And Pain At The Injection Site. Seventeen Reports Met Inclusion Criteria For Assessing Adverse Effects. Seven Looked Specifically At Naltrexone Implants For Treatment Of Opioid Dependence And Wound Infection, Allergic Reaction To The Implant And Number Of Implants Removed. The Majority Of The Trials Did Not Have A Control Group And Systematic Assessment Of Adverse Effects Was Lacking.",,,

Thirty hospital inpatients with venous ulcers participated in this study for a treatment period of five weeks. They were divided randomly and equally into three groups (2 treatment groups and one control group). Patients in group (1) (HBOT group) received two 90 minutes treatments daily with 2 to3 L of humidified oxygen / minute at 22 mmHg. On the other hand, patients in group (2) (laser therapy group) received 1 J/cm2 infrared laser (Ga As), three times weekly. Patients in group (3) (control group) received standard wound care only. Wound surface area (WSA) and wound volume (WV) were used to measure the outcomes before starting the study and after the 3rd and 5th weeks posttreatment. It was found that, at the 5th week post-treatment there was a significant reduction in both WSA and WV in both the HBOT group and the laser therapy group when compared to the control group (P<0.0001), also there was a significant reduction in WSA and WV in the laser therapy group at the 5th week post-treatment when compared to the HBOT group (P<0.001). The findings strongly suggest that the application of infrared laser therapy at a dose of 1J/cm2, three times/week is more effective than the application of HBOT daily in the management of chronic venous ulcers.

Usually The Cases Involve Lumps Of Meat, Bones, Shards  Of Glass, Bottle Tops, Batteries Or Dentures. We Would Like To Report About An  Unusual Foreign Body Found In The Oesophagus. Patient: A 45-Year-Old Patient  Presented Himself In Our Interdisciplinary Casualty Department Where He Claimed  To Have Swallowed A Butter-Knife That Morning As A Bet. The Ent Examination  Showed No Abnormal Findings. The Thorax X-Ray Revealed A 14 Cm-Long Foreign Body  In Projection To The Oesophagus, Which Matched The Knife. Following Consultation  With The Thorax Surgeon, A Rigid Oesophagoscopy Was Conducted Under Endotracheal  Intubation And The Knife Was Easily Removed Using Tongs. Archive Searches  Conducted In The Meantime Showed That Foreign Bodies Had Been Removed From The  Patient On Numerous Occasions By Fellow Surgeons Either Laparoscopically Or Via  Open Surgery. As A Result, The Patient Was Transferred To The Psychiatric Ward  With Unimpeded Swallowing Reflex With A Suspected Self-Harming Syndrome.  Discussion: As An Ent Emergency, A Foreign Body In The Oesophagus Generally  Requires Intervention Because Of The Risk Of Complications Such As Perforation Or  Pressure-Induced Necrosis Of The Oesophagus Wall With Resulting Mediastinitis.  Suitable Instruments Are The Flexible Oesophagoscope, The Rigid Oesophagoscope  Under Anaesthesia Or Transcervical/Transthoracic Removal. The Choice Of Procedure  Crucially Depends On The Type And Localisation Of The Foreign Body In The  Oesophagus.

This Review Discusses The Anaesthetic Potential Risks And Complications Observed  With Tattooing And Piercing, Their Management And Prevention. Recent Findings:  Airway Management During Anaesthesia Is Of Particular Interest With Oral Jewelry.  Patients Often Refuse To Remove Their Piercing For Fear Of Tract Closure.

Even Theoretical  Concerns Are More And More Debated. Summary: Oral And Nasal Piercing Is Of  Particular Concern Because Of The Risks Of Swallowing And Aspiration.  Consequently, Patients Should Be Advised To Remove Piercing Before Anaesthesia.  Emergency Situations Are Especially Risky And Anaesthesiologists Should Be Aware  Of The Piercing Removal Techniques.

Current Literature Lacks Good  Data Documenting Long-Term Outcomes In Children. This Makes It Difficult To  Counsel Some Patients About Realistic Treatment Expectations. The Objective Of  This Study Is To Evaluate Our Institutional Experience And Define The Natural  History And Treatment Outcomes. Methods: A Retrospective Review Of Clinical Data  Obtained From Children Who Underwent Dilation For Ps Was Performed. Results: Over  The Past 30 Years, 114 Children And Adolescents Received 486 Dilations. The Most  Common Indications For Stricture Dilation Were Ps (42%) And Esophageal Atresia  (38%). Other Lesser Indications Included Congenital, Foreign Body, Corrosive,  Cancer, Radiation, Allergic, And Infectious. This Review Focuses On The 48  Children With Ps. Of The Children With Ps, A Congenital Anomaly Was Identified In  23 Children; And 12 Had Neurologic Impairment. Average Age At Presentation Was  10.2 Years (Range, 0.5-18.3 Years). Most Patients Had Had Symptoms For Many  Months Before Diagnosis. Peptic Stricture Was Most Common In The Lower Esophagus  (N = 39). However, Middle (N = 8) And Upper (N = 1) Strictures Were Occasionally  Identified. Noncompliance With Medical Therapy Was A Challenge In 12% (N = 5) Of  Children. Children With A Ps Received A Median Of 3 Dilations, But A Subset Of 5  Patients With Severe Strictures Underwent Up To 48 Dilations (Range, 1-48).  Repeated Dilations Were Required For A Median Of 20 Months (Range, 1-242 Months).  Among Patients Receiving Esophageal Dilation For Ps, 94% Required An Antireflux  Procedure (19% Required A Second Antireflux Surgery). A Subgroup Of Patients (N =  10) Was Identified Who Required Extended Dilations, Multiple Surgeries, And  Esophageal Resection. This Subgroup Had A Significantly Longer Period Of  Symptomatic Disease And Increased Risk Of Esophageal Resection Compared With  Those Patients Requiring Fewer Dilations. Surgical Resection Of The Esophageal  Stricture Was Ultimately Required In 3 Children With Ps After Failure Of More  Conservative Measures. Conclusion: Children And Adolescents Presenting With  Reflux Esophageal Stricture (Ps) Frequently Require Antireflux Surgery, Redo  Antireflux Surgery, And Multiple Dilations For Recurrent Symptoms.

We Studied The Poorly  Understood Group Of Patients Who Intentionally Ingest Fbs. Methods: Cases Of  Intentional Ingestion Of Fbs (N = 305) Were Identified, Retrospectively, From An  Electronic Endoscopy Database And Followed. Cases Occurred Among 33 Different  Patients, Who Underwent Endoscopy From October 1, 2001, To July 31, 2009 (39.0  Cases/Year); 79% Were Diagnosed With A Psychiatric Disorder. Financial Cost  Analysis Was Performed Using Hospital Billing And Cost Systems. Results: Commonly  Ingested Fbs Included Pens (23.6%), Batteries (9.2%), Knives (7.2%), And Razor  Blades (6.9%). Most Endoscopic Procedures Were Performed Under General  Anesthesia. Fbs Were Commonly Retrieved By Snares (58.0%), Rat-Toothed Forceps  (14.4%), And Nets (11.5%), Assisted Sometimes By Use Of Overtubes (10.8%), And  Hoods (4.6%). Fb Extraction Was Unsuccessful At The Initial Endoscopy In Only 20  Cases; 2 Cases Eventually Required Surgical Extraction. Minor Complications  Occurred In 11 Endoscopies. There Were No Deaths Or Perforations. The Total  Estimated Costs Were $2,018,073 ($1,500,627 In Hospital Costs, $240,640 In  Physician Fees, And $276,806 For Security Services). Costs Were Significantly  Higher For Inpatients. Major Payers Were Medicare (48%) And Medicaid (31%).  Conclusions: Intentional Fb Ingestion Occurs Among A Relatively Small Number Of  Patients With Psychiatric Disorders And Is Costly. Endoscopic Retrieval Is  Relatively Effective And Safe, But Often Requires General Anesthesia. These Cases  Utilize Significant Hospital And Fiscal Resources. Attention Should Be Focused On  Preventing These Recurrent And Costly Episodes.",,,

It Frequently Causes Some Degree Of Discomfort To The Patient. Various Different Topical Agents, Which Are Intended To Reduce This Discomfort, Are In Common Use. This Review Aimed To Assess The Effectiveness Of The Various Agents. Objectives To Assess The Effectiveness Of Topical Preparations Used To Reduce Discomfort And Facilitate Npl In Adults. Search Methods We Searched The Cochrane Ear, Nose And Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; The Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials (Central); Pubmed; Embase; Cinahl; Web Of Science; Biosis Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; Isrctn And Additional Sources For Published And Unpublished Trials. The Date Of The Most Recent Search Was 14 April 2010. Selection Criteria Randomised Controlled Trials (Rcts) Looking At The Effect Of Topical Anaesthetic Or Vasoconstrictor Agents Used Reduce Discomfort And Facilitate Npl In Adult Patients. Data Collection And Analysis Two Review Authors Independently Selected Studies, Extracted Data And Assessed Risk Of Bias. We Contacted Trial Authors For Further Information Where Necessary. The Primary Outcome Measured Was Pain/Discomfort. Secondary Outcomes That Were Looked At Included Side Effects Of The Topical Medications, Ease Of The Procedure And The Quality Of The View From The Operator'S Perspective. Main Results We Included Eight Rcts (746 Participants) In The Review. The Risk Of Bias In The Studies Was Generally Low. Five Studies Did Not Demonstrate Any Advantage In Using A Topical Treatment Prior To Endoscopy. One Study Suggested That A Vasoconstrictor Alone Should Be Used To Reduce The General Level Of Unpleasantness. Two Studies Did Not Compare Treatment Against Placebo Or No Treatment, So It Was Not Possible To Draw Meaningful Conclusions From Them. There May Be Some Unpleasant Side Effects From The Use Of Topical Preparations, Such As Unpleasant Taste. There Was Variation In The Format Of The Outcome Data And A Lack Of Complete Data; None Of The Included Studies Reported Their Results In A Way That Would Allow Pooling And We Could Not Therefore Perform Meta‐Analysis. Authors' Conclusions The Included Studies Do Not Demonstrate Any Evidence To Support The Use Of Topical Treatments Prior To The Use Of A Fibre‐Optic Nasal Endoscope. Some Go As Far As To Suggest That These Agents Should Not Be Used Due To Cost And Unpleasant Side Effects. Five Studies Did Not Demonstrate Any Advantage In Terms Of Reducing Pain Or Discomfort When Using A Topical Treatment Prior To Endoscopy. The Absence Of Demonstrable Effect May Be Due To Relatively Small Patient Groups. It Is Therefore Possible That There Is A Small Effect Of Using These Sprays. Further Research Using Standardised Reporting Methods Is Needed. Plain Language Summary Topical Anaesthetic Or Vasoconstrictor (Blood Vessel Narrowing) Preparations For Flexible Fibre‐Optic Nasal Pharyngoscopy And Laryngoscopy Topical Medications Are Often Applied To The Inside Of A Patient'S Nose Prior To Examining The Nose, Sinuses And Throat With A Flexible Nasopharyngolaryngoscope. The Aim Of This Is To Reduce Any Discomfort The Patient May Feel And Also To Improve The Adequacy Of The Examination. Types Of Preparation Include Lidocaine, Phenylephrine And Lidocaine, Oxymetazoline, Xylometazoline And Cocaine And They Are Usually Administered As A Spray, Although They May Also Be In The Form Of A Solution Which Can Be Applied To Cotton Wool And Placed In The Nasal Cavity, Or As Gels, Pastes Or Creams. We Looked For Randomised Controlled Trials Comparing Any Of These Topical Treatments With Placebo, No Treatment Or Another Topical Treatment In Adult Patients Undergoing Nasal Pharyngolaryngoscopy (Npl). We Included Eight Studies In The Review (With A Total Of 746 Patients). It Was Not Possible To Combine Data From Any Of The Studies, Therefore We Assessed The Individual Study Results. Five Of The Studies Did Not Demonstrate Any Advantage, In Terms Of Reducing Pain Or Discomfort, Of Using A Topical Treatment Prior To Endoscopy. One Of These Suggested That A Vasoconstrictor (Xylometazoline) Alone Reduced The Level Of ""General Unpleasantness"". Two Studies Did Not Compare The Treatment Against Placebo Or No Treatment. A Final Study Actually Suggested An Increase In Pain With The Use Of Topical Agents. There May Be Some Unpleasant Side Effects From The Use Of Topical Preparations, Such As Unpleasant Taste. Further Standardised Research Is Required.",,,

Methods:  The Medical Records Of 249 Patients Who Ingested Fbs Were Reviewed. In Addition,  They Were Studied By Telephone Questionnaires To Follow Up Spontaneously Passed  Fb. The Factors Associated With Sp Such As Age, The Type, Size, And Initial  Location Of The Fbs Were Analyzed. Results: Foreign Bodies Were Spontaneously  Passed In 145 Patients (58.2%), Endoscopic Removal Was Performed In 100 Patients  (40.2%), And Operative Removal Was Performed In 4 Patients (1.6%). Most Sp Fbs  Were Passed Within 5 Days. The Sp Rates (Sprs) According To The Initial Location  Were The Following: 12.2% For The Esophagus (P<0.0001), 71.4% For The Stomach,  85.7% For The Small Bowel, And 96.4% For The Colon. There Was No Significant  Difference In The Spr According To Age. When Coins And Disk Batteries That  Required Early Endoscopic Removal Were Excluded, The Spr Was 63.4% For Fbs Less  Than 10 Mm, 80.4% For Fbs 10 To 20 Mm, 72.8% For Fbs 20 To 30 Mm, And 50.0% For  Fbs More Than 30 Mm (P=0.091).

in children, whereas the majority of adults will have neu-
rological dysfunction, trauma, alcohol abuse, or psycho-
logical disorders. 1 Much has been written about psychiat-
ric patients engaging in self-mutilation such as cutting and
burning, but little is recorded about deliberate aspiration of
objects in these patients, who clinically can be separated
into 4 groups: (1) malingering, (2) psychosis, (3) pica, and (4)
personality disorders. The immediate psychological gain for
these patients is unclear, as the act is insidious with no evi-
dence of intentional harm or immediate danger. Thus, they
are considered as being parasuicidal events designed to
diminish other psychological processes. 2 Aspirated objects
that are not immediately dislodged by coughing, chok-
ing, or gagging require surgical intervention. Most of these
patients usually come to the attention of a psychiatrist, but
such intervention does not prevent recurrences. We discuss
a schizophrenic patient who aspirated multiple coins while
under psychiatric treatment for prior episodes of aspiration
of coins, ingestion of objects, and insertion of others in his

The  Aim Of The Study Is To Evaluate The Feasibility, Safety, And Outcomes Of The  Procedure. Methods: Three Patients (2 Girls And 1 Boy) With Average Age 46 Months  (34-57 Months) And Average Weight 12.6 Kg (11-15 Kg) Underwent The Procedure. The  Indications For Esophagectomy Were Esophageal Stricture From Caustic Ingestion (2  Patients) And Failed Repair Of Esophageal Atresia (1 Patient). Results: Average  Operative Time Was 7 H (0519-0752 Hours). There Were No Intraoperative  Complications With The Average Blood Loss Of 50 Cc (5-125 Cc). No Anastomotic  Leaks Were Noted On The Initial Esophagrams That Were Obtained On Postoperative  Day Five Or Six. One Patient Developed A Cervical Wound Infection On  Postoperative Day Seven Due To A Retained Piece Of Penrose, Which Required A Neck  Exploration, Removal Of Foreign Body And Repair Of A Small Leak. One Patient  Developed An Anastomotic Stricture At The 7-Month Follow-Up. She Was Successfully  Treated With Two Balloon Dilatations. One Patient Developed A Delayed  Esophagogastric Anastomotic Leak At 3 Months. The Leak Spontaneously Closed After  Surgical Drainage. At Average Of 22-Month Follow-Up (15-36 Months), All Patients  Were Eating Regular Food With Excellent Weight Gain. Conclusion: Minimally  Invasive Esophagectomy And Gastric Pull-Up Is Technically Challenging But  Feasible And Safe With Acceptable Outcomes. However, Further Study Is Needed To  Further Validate The Approach.",,,

Common malignancies in renal transplant recipients are non melanoma skin cancer, Kaposi sarcoma and non-hodgkin lymphoma with a 20 fold increase in their risk. Renal cell carcinoma in native kidneys after renal transplant is quite infrequent (0.3-4.8%). Here we report first case of renal cell carcinoma originating in native kidney, diagnosed by EUS guided FNA. Case Description: A 54-year-old gentleman status post renal transplant secondary to Goodpastures syndrome presented with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. His past medical history include hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. Early investigations included a liver battery, amylase, lipase; CBC and a basic metabolic panel were found negative. A right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed normal liver and gallbladder, however, cyst was found in an enlarged right native kidney. MRI of the abdomen showed retroperitoneal lymph nodes concerning for lymphoma along with enlargement of the right native kidney with irregular borders concerning for neoplasm. He then underwent endoscopic ultrasound to evaluate the perigastric/peripancreatic area for possible fine-needle aspiration of lymph nodes. The endosonographic examination revealed multiple lymph nodes at sub-carinal, paraesophageal, celiac axis, peripancreatic and periduodenal areas. Small-to-moderate amount of ascites was identified. Using a 25-gauge needle, fine-needle aspiration was performed from mediatsinal lymph nodes, celiac lymph nodes and peripancreatic lymph nodes. Ascetic fluid was then aspirated using a 19-gauge needle under endosonographic guidance. Cytopathology of the lymph node and ascetic fluid samples revealed metastatic renal cell carcinoma. PET scan confirmed it by lighting up in right kidney and other areas of metastatic lymphadenopathy. Conclusion: In conclusion, EUS guided FNA could have an important role in identifying the primary source of metastatic lymphadenopathy in renal transplant patients. It is safe, minimally invasive, feasible and highly accurate in making such diagnosis and assisting further management.",,

Thought it is a rare form of skin cancer there are about 160,000 new cases of melanoma yearly worldwide. More than 53,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with melanoma every year. It is currently the fastest growing cancer, both in the U.S. and worldwide. We present a case of a patient with metastatic malignant melanoma presenting as an infiltrating mass into the duodenum from the retroperitoneal space. A 77 year old male presented with fatigue and weight loss over the course of the preceding several months. The patient's past medical history was only significant for hyperlipidemia and BPH. The patient states that he has lost 40 lbs over the previous 1-2 months prior to admission. Physical exam was benign except for a palpable mass and guaiac testing was positive. The patient had a CT scan which demonstrated large complex lobulated mass in the sub-hepatic space measuring approximately 14.7 _ 14.1 _ 10.8 cm. The patient's labs demonstrated hemoglobin of 7.9, and the patient was transfused and taken for upper endoscopy. On esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) neoplastic lesions were noted to infiltrate the dudodenal bulb. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration demonstrated a hetergoenous mass with both hypo/hyperechoic features. The biopsy showed malignant cells most in architecture to melanoma. Immuno-histochemical studies performed on the cell block demonstrated positive staining of the tumor cells for vimentin, HMB45, melan-A, and focally for S100. Stains for mixed cytokeratins, smooth muscle actin, and CD34 are negative in the tumor cells. The final diagnosis of malignant melanoma was subsequently made. The patient was referred for surgical evaluation. Metastatic retroperitoneal lesions resulting from melanoma is an extremely rare finding and EUS-FNA is a novel method for diagnosing metastatic lesions. EUS-FNA has been shown to be a safe and reliable modality for obtaining definitive histological diagnosis. When it is compared with the traditional diagnostic modalities, it is not only more accurate than imaging studies such as computerized tomography, positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, but it is also a very safe procedure with fewer complications than transcutaneous biopsies. Clinicians should be aware of this imaging modality and consider its employment when applicable.",,

Rigid esophagoscopy for extraction of ingested foreign bodies is the recommended treatment. The purpose of this study was to present our experience with rigid esophagoscopy in removal of esophageal foreign bodies.

Material & Methods: This descriptive study was carried out from 1st January 2007 to 31st December 2011, in Department of ENT, Head & Neck Surgery, DHQ Teaching Hospital, D.I.Khan. One hundred and fifty five patients with suspected esophageal foreign bodies, irrespective of age and gender were included in the study. Rigid esophagoscopy under general anesthesia was performed by experienced ENT consultant. Each patient was studied for age, gender, symptomatology, site of impaction, type of foreign body extracted, and complications encountered. All patients were observed for 24 hours in the ward after procedure.

Several Brands Of These  Expanding Wood Glues (Those Containing Diphenylmethane Diisocyanate [Mdi]) Have  The Potential To Form Gastrointestinal (Gi) Foreign Bodies If Ingested. The  Ingested Adhesive Forms An Expanding Ball Of Glue In The Esophagus And Gastric  Lumen. This Expansion Is Caused By A Polymerization Reaction Using The Heat,  Water, And Gastric Acids Of The Stomach. A Firm Mass Is Created That Can Be 4-8  Times Its Original Volume. As Little As 2 Oz Of Glue Have Been Reported To  Develop Gastric Foreign Bodies. The Obstructive Mass Is Reported To Form Within  Minutes Of Ingestion Of The Adhesive. The Foreign Body Can Lead To Esophageal  Impaction And Obstruction, Airway Obstruction, Gastric Outflow Obstruction,  Mucosal Hemorrhage, Ulceration, Laceration, Perforation Of The Esophageal And  Gastric Linings, And Death. Clinical Signs Following Ingestion Include Anorexia,  Lethargy, Vomiting, Tachypnea, And Abdominal Distention And Pain, And Typically  Develop Within 12 Hours. Clinical Signs May Depend Upon The Size Of The Mass. If  Left Untreated, Perforation And Rupture Of The Esophagus Or Stomach Can Occur.  The Glue Mass Does Not Stick To The Gi Mucosa And Is Not Always Detectable On  Abdominal Palpation. Radiographs Are Recommended To Confirm The Presence Of The  ""Glue-Ball"" Foreign Body, And Radiographic Evidence Of The Obstruction May Be  Seen As Early As 4-6 Hours Following Ingestion. Emesis Is Contraindicated Owing  To The Risk Of Aspiration Of The Glue Into The Respiratory Tree Or The Subsequent  Lodging Of The Expanding Glue Mass In The Esophagus.

Mandibular Fractures May Be Treated Using Open (Surgical) And Closed (Non‐Surgical) Techniques. Fracture Sites Are Immobilized With Intermaxillary Fixation (Imf) Or Other External Or Internal Devices (I.E. Plates And Screws) To Allow Bone Healing. Various Techniques Have Been Used, However Uncertainty Exists With Respect To The Specific Indications For Each Approach. Objectives The Objective Of This Review Is To Provide Reliable Evidence Of The Effects Of Any Interventions Either Open (Surgical) Or Closed (Non‐Surgical) That Can Be Used In The Management Of Mandibular Fractures, Excluding The Condyles, In Adult Patients. Search Methods We Searched The Following Electronic Databases: The Cochrane Oral Health Group'S Trials Register (To 28 February 2013), The Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials (Central) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 1), Medline Via Ovid (1950 To 28 February 2013), Embase Via Ovid (1980 To 28 February 2013),  Meta Register Of Controlled Trials (To 7 April 2013), Clinicaltrials.Gov (To 7 April 2013) And The Who International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (To 7 April 2013). The Reference Lists Of All Trials Identified Were Checked For Further Studies. There Were No Restrictions Regarding Language Or Date Of Publication. Selection Criteria Randomised Controlled Trials Evaluating The Management Of Mandibular Fractures Without Condylar Involvement. Any Studies That Compared Different Treatment Approaches Were Included. Data Collection And Analysis At Least Two Review Authors Independently Assessed Trial Quality And Extracted Data. Results Were To Be Expressed As Random‐Effects Models Using Mean Differences For Continuous Outcomes And Risk Ratios For Dichotomous Outcomes With 95% Confidence Intervals. Heterogeneity Was To Be Investigated To Include Both Clinical And Methodological Factors. Main Results Twelve Studies, Assessed As High (Six) And Unclear (Six) Risk Of Bias, Comprising 689 Participants (830 Fractures), Were Included. Interventions Examined Different Plate Materials And Morphology; Use Of One Or Two Lag Screws; Microplate Versus Miniplate; Early And Delayed Mobilization; Eyelet Wires Versus Rapid Imf™ And The Management Of Angle Fractures With Intraoral Access Alone Or Combined With A Transbuccal Approach. Patient‐Oriented Outcomes Were Largely Ignored And Post‐Operative Pain Scores Were Inadequately Reported. Unfortunately, Only One Or Two Trials With Small Sample Sizes Were Conducted For Each Comparison And Outcome. Our Results And Conclusions Should Therefore Be Interpreted With Caution. We Were Able To Pool The Results For Two Comparisons Assessing One Outcome. Pooled Data From Two Studies Comparing Two Miniplates Versus One Miniplate Revealed No Significant Difference In The Risk Of Post‐Operative Infection Of Surgical Site (Risk Ratio (Rr) 1.32, 95% Ci 0.41 To 4.22, P = 0.64, I 2  = 0%). Similarly, No Difference In Post‐Operative Infection Between The Use Of Two 3‐Dimensional (3D) And Standard (2D) Miniplates Was Determined (Rr 1.26, 95% Ci 0.19 To 8.13, P = 0.81, I 2  = 27%). The Included Studies Involved A Small Number Of Participants With A Low Number Of Events. Authors' Conclusions This Review Illustrates That There Is Currently Inadequate Evidence To Support The Effectiveness Of A Single Approach In The Management Of Mandibular Fractures Without Condylar Involvement. The Lack Of High Quality Evidence May Be Explained By Clinical Diversity, Variability In Assessment Tools Used And Difficulty In Grading Outcomes With Existing Measurement Tools. Until High Level Evidence Is Available, Treatment Decisions Should Continue To Be Based On The Clinician'S Prior Experience And The Individual Circumstances. Plain Language Summary Treatments For Fractures Of The Lower Jaw Review Question The Lower Jaw (Also Known As The Mandible) Is An Important Bone That Shapes The Face, Holds The Lower Teeth In Place And Is Used To Move The Mouth, For Talking And Chewing Food. Fractures Are Most Often Found In The Part Of The Lower Jaw That Supports Teeth (Known As The Body), The Part Where The Jaw Curves Upwards Into The Neck (The Angle), Or At The Knobbly‐Shaped Joint Found At The Very Top Of The Jaw Bone (The Condyle). Available Treatments Align And Stabilize The Fracture, Allowing The Bone To Heal In The Proper Position. Treatments May Or May Not Involve Surgery. This Review, Produced By The Cochrane Oral Health Group, Examines Different Methods For Treating Fractures Of The Body And Angle Of The Mandible In Existing Research And Studies. Background People Of All Ages Can Fracture Their Lower Jaw, But Fractures Mainly Occur As A Result Of Violence (For Example, Being Hit Or Punched In The Jaw) Or By Being Involved In An Accident On The Road (For Example, Car Crashes Or Bicycle Accidents). These Fractures Can Be Stabilized By Physically Binding The Jaw Shut With A System Of Bars, Wires Or Elastic Bands (Intermaxillary Fixation), Or By Using Tiny Screws Or Plates Attached Directly To The Fractured Sections Of The Lower Jaw Bone Whilst Still Allowing The Mouth To Open (Rigid Fixation). Study Characteristics The Evidence On Which This Review Is Based Is Up To Date As Of 28 February 2013. Twelve Studies With A Combined Total Of 689 Participants Were Included In This Review. Participants Ranged In Age From 16 To 68 Years And Most Participants (90%) Were Male. All Of The Studies Compared Different Types Of Surgical Treatments, And Each Study Evaluated A Different Aspect Of Surgical Treatment Such As Different Types Of Plates, Screws, Or Wires Or How Long The Jaw Was Immobilized After Surgery. Key Results There Were Concerns About The Design And Quality Of All The Studies. All The Studies Evaluated Different Aspects Of Surgical Treatment. None Of The Studies Evaluated Non‐Surgical Treatments Such As Intermaxillary Fixation And No Study Compared Surgical Treatment With Non‐Surgical Treatment. As A Result There Is No Clear Evidence To Indicate Which Approach Is The Best To Manage These Fractures. Quality Of The Evidence The Quality Of The Evidence Found Is Poor. Recommendations Are Made For Further Well‐Conducted Research Studies In This Area To Be Undertaken.",,,

Although There Are Many Kinds Of Interventions, The Optimal One For The Palliation Of Dysphagia Remains Unclear. This Review Updates The Previous Version Published In 2009. Objectives The Aim Of This Review Was To Systematically Analyse And Summarise The Efficacy Of Different Interventions Used In The Palliation Of Dysphagia In Primary Oesophageal And Gastro‐Oesophageal Carcinoma. Search Methods To Find New Studies For This Updated Review, In January 2014 We Searched, According To The Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal And Pancreatic Diseases Model, The Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials (Central) ( The Cochrane Library ), Medline, Embase And Cinahl; And Major Conference Proceedings (Up To January 2014).   Selection Criteria Only Randomised Controlled Trials (Rcts) Were Included In Which Patients With Inoperable Or Unresectable Primary Oesophageal Cancer Underwent Palliative Treatment. Different Interventions Like Rigid Plastic Intubation, Self‐Expanding Metallic Stent (Sems) Insertion, Brachytherapy, External Beam Radiotherapy, Chemotherapy, Oesophageal Bypass Surgery, Chemical And Thermal Ablation Therapy, Either Head‐To‐Head Or In Combination, Were Included. The Primary Outcome Was Dysphagia Improvement. Secondary Outcomes Included Recurrent Dysphagia, Technical Success, Procedure Related Mortality, 30‐Day Mortality, Adverse Effects And Quality Of Life. Data Collection And Analysis Data Collection And Analysis Were Performed In Accordance With The Methods Of The Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal And Pancreatic Diseases Review Group. Main Results We Included 3684 Patients From 53 Studies. Sems Insertion Was Safer And More Effective Than Plastic Tube Insertion. Thermal And Chemical Ablative Therapy Provided Comparable Dysphagia Palliation But Had An Increased Requirement For Re‐Interventions And For Adverse Effects. Anti‐Reflux Stents Provided Comparable Dysphagia Palliation To Conventional Metal Stents. Some Anti‐Reflux Stents Might Have Reduced Gastro‐Oesophageal Reflux And Complications. Newly‐Designed Double‐Layered Nitinol (Niti‐S) Stents Were Preferable Due To Longer Survival Time And Fewer Complications Compared To Simple Niti‐S Stents. Brachytherapy Might Be A Suitable Alternative To Sems In Providing A Survival Advantage And Possibly A Better Quality Of Life, And Might Provide Better Results When Combined With Argon Plasma Coagulation Or External Beam Radiation Therapy. Authors' Conclusions Self‐Expanding Metal Stent Insertion Is Safe, Effective And Quicker In Palliating Dysphagia Compared To Other Modalities. However, High‐Dose Intraluminal Brachytherapy Is A Suitable Alternative And Might Provide Additional Survival Benefit With A Better Quality Of Life. Some Anti‐Reflux Stents And Newly‐Designed Stents Lead To Longer Survival And Fewer Complications Compared To Conventional Stents. Combinations Of Brachytherapy With Self‐Expanding Metal Stent Insertion Or Radiotherapy Are Preferable Due To The Reduced Requirement For Re‐Interventions. Rigid Plastic Tube Insertion, Dilatation Alone Or In Combination With Other Modalities, And Chemotherapy Alone Are Not Recommended For Palliation Of Dysphagia Due To A High Incidence Of Delayed Complications And Recurrent Dysphagia. Plain Language Summary Interventions For Reducing Difficulty In Swallowing In People With Oesophageal Cancer Review Question For Most Patients With Unresectable Or Inoperable Oesophageal Cancer, Providing Clinical Benefit With Palliative Treatment Is Highly Desirable. However, The Optimal Palliative Technique For Dysphagia Improvement And Better Quality Of Life Is Not Established. Background Dysphagia (Difficulty Or Discomfort In Swallowing) Is Common Among Patients With Unresectable Or Inoperable Oesophageal Cancer. There Are Five Levels Of Dysphagia, Ranging From The Ability To Eat A Normal Diet To Some Solids, Semisolids, Liquids And To Complete Dysphagia. Study Characteristics The Review Included Randomised Controlled Studies Comparing The Use Of Different Interventions To Improve Dysphagia Among Patients With Inoperable Or Unresectable Primary Oesophageal Cancer. To Find New Studies For This Updated Review, In January 2014 We Searched, According To The Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal And Pancreatic Diseases Model, The Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials (Central) ( The Cochrane Library ), Medline, Embase And Cinahl; And Major Conference Proceedings (Up To January 2014). Key Results The Review Updates The Previous Version But Still Fails To Present Any Obvious Superiority Of One Technique Over Another Among The Different Kinds Of Interventions. Self‐Expanding Metal Stents Provided Safer And More Effective Relief Of Dysphagia Compared To Rigid Plastic Stents. Other Techniques Like Radiotherapy Or Brachytherapy Were Also Suitable Alternatives And Might Be Favourable In Improving Quality Of Life And Prolonging Survival. Individual Differences Should Be Emphasised When The Intervention Type Was Determined. Quality Of The Evidence Half Of The Studies Included In This Review Were Of High Quality. Most Studies Did Not State The Methods Used To Seek And Report Quality Of Life Outcomes And Adverse Effects.",,,

The Preoperative Examination Using Ultrasonography And Computed Tomography Showed A Linear Foreign Body. Results: The Fish Bone Was Thought To Be Embedded Deeply In The Parotid Duct; Therefore, We Used A Combined Approach (Endoscopy With Open Surgery), Because We Anticipated Difficulties With Endoscopic Removal Of The Fish Bone. The Endoscopic View Showed That The Fish Bone Had Partially Penetrated The Soft Tissue In The Parotid Duct Wall, But The Fish Bone Could Not Be Removed Endoscopically. With Endoscopic Assistance, The Impacted Fish Bone Was Removed Using An Intraoral Surgical Approach. The Clinical Outcome Was Satisfactory During A 10-Month Follow-Up Period, With No Evidence Of Complications.

Fish bone (FB) is one of the common causes of foreign body impaction in the pharynx and esophagus.
Purpose
To investigate the efficacy of 64-slice multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) for the evaluation of pharynx and upper esophageal FB foreign bodies.
Material and Methods
Sixty-six patients with suspected FB foreign body ingestion were examined by plain radiography (n_=_40) and unenhanced MDCT (n_=_66). We analyzed the presence, location, size, shape, and lying position of the foreign bodies.
Results
On MDCT, 46 foreign bodies were detected. Among them, 45 were confirmed by endoscopy. The sensitivity of MDCT for the detection of foreign bodies was 100%, which was superior to that of the plain radiography (51.7%). The location of the foreign bodies was most common in the upper esophagus (n_=_22, 47.8%), followed by pharyngoesophageal junction (n_=_10, 21.7%), transjunctional (n_=_7, 15.2%), hypopharynx (n_=_5, 10.9%), and oropharynx (n_=_2, 4.3%). Their longest length was 5.340.1_mm (mean, 21.3_mm). Thirty-three FBs (71.7%) were linear and 13 (28.3%) were flat in shape. They showed transverse (n_=_23, 50.0%), parallel (n_=_13, 28.3%), and oblique positions (n_=_10, 21.7%) to the long axis of the pharynx and esophagus, respectively.
Conclusion
MDCT is useful for the evaluation of the pharynx and upper esophageal FB foreign bodies.",,

Previous Trials And Meta‐Analyses Have Led To Different Conclusions On Whether A High Fraction Of Supplemental Inspired Oxygen During Anaesthesia May Decrease Or Increase Mortality And Surgical Site Infections In Surgical Patients. Objectives To Assess The Benefits And Harms Of An Fio 2  Equal To Or Greater Than 60% Compared With A Control Fio 2  At Or Below 40% In The Perioperative Setting In Terms Of Mortality, Surgical Site Infection, Respiratory Insufficiency, Serious Adverse Events And Length Of Stay During The Index Admission For Adult Surgical Patients. We Looked At Various Outcomes, Conducted Subgroup And Sensitivity Analyses, Examined The Role Of Bias And Applied Trial Sequential Analysis (Tsa) To Examine The Level Of Evidence Supporting Or Refuting A High Fio 2  During Surgery, Anaesthesia And Recovery. Search Methods We Searched The Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials (Central), Medline, Embase, Biosis, International Web Of Science, The Latin American And Caribbean Health Science Information Database (Lilacs), Advanced Google And The Cumulative Index To Nursing And Allied Health Literature (Cinahl) Up To February 2014. We Checked The References Of Included Trials And Reviews For Unidentified Relevant Trials And Reran The Searches In March 2015. We Will Consider Two Studies Of Interest When We Update The Review. Selection Criteria We Included Randomized Clinical Trials That Compared A High Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen With A Routine Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen During Anaesthesia, Surgery And Recovery In Individuals 18 Years Of Age Or Older. Data Collection And Analysis Two Review Authors Extracted Data Independently. We Conducted Random‐Effects And Fixed‐Effect Meta‐Analyses, And For Dichotomous Outcomes, We Calculated Risk Ratios (Rrs). We Used Published Data And Data Obtained By Contacting Trial Authors. To Minimize The Risk Of Systematic Error, We Assessed The Risk Of Bias Of The Included Trials. To Reduce The Risk Of Random Errors Caused By Sparse Data And Repetitive Updating Of Cumulative Meta‐Analyses, We Applied Trial Sequential Analyses. We Used Grades Of Recommendation, Assessment, Development And Evaluation (Grade) To Assess The Quality Of The Evidence. Main Results We Included 28 Randomized Clinical Trials (9330 Participants); In The 21 Trials Reporting Relevant Outcomes For This Review, 7597 Participants Were Randomly Assigned To A High Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen Versus A Routine Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen. In Trials With An Overall Low Risk Of Bias, A High Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen Compared With A Routine Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen Was Not Associated With All‐Cause Mortality (Random‐Effects Model: Rr 1.12, 95% Confidence Interval (Ci) 0.93 To 1.36; Grade: Low Quality) Within The Longest Follow‐Up And Within 30 Days Of Follow‐Up (Peto Odds Ratio (Or) 0.99, 95% Ci 0.61 To 1.60; Grade: Low Quality). In A Trial Sequential Analysis, The Required Information Size Was Not Reached And The Analysis Could Not Refute A 20% Increase In Mortality. Similarly, When All Trials Were Included, A High Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen Was Not Associated With All���Cause Mortality To The Longest Follow‐Up (Rr 1.07, 95% Ci 0.87 To 1.33) Or Within 30 Days Of Follow‐Up (Peto Or 0.83, 95% Ci 0.54 To 1.29), Both Of Very Low Quality According To Grade. Neither Was A High Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen Associated With The Risk Of Surgical Site Infection In Trials With Low Risk Of Bias (Rr 0.86, 95% Ci 0.63 To 1.17; Grade: Low Quality) Or In All Trials (Rr 0.87, 95% Ci 0.71 To 1.07; Grade: Low Quality). A High Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen Was Not Associated With Respiratory Insufficiency (Rr 1.25, 95% Ci 0.79 To 1.99), Serious Adverse Events (Rr 0.96, 95% Ci 0.65 To 1.43) Or Length Of Stay (Mean Difference ‐0.06 Days, 95% Ci ‐0.44 To 0.32 Days). In Subgroup Analyses Of Nine Trials Using Preoperative Antibiotics, A High Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen Was Associated With A Decrease In Surgical Site Infections (Rr 0.76, 95% Ci 0.60 To 0.97; Grade: Very Low Quality); A Similar Effect Was Noted In The Five Trials Adequately Blinded For The Outcome Assessment (Rr 0.79, 95% Ci 0.66 To 0.96; Grade: Very Low Quality). We Did Not Observe An Effect Of A High Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen On Surgical Site Infections In Any Other Subgroup Analyses. Authors' Conclusions As The Risk Of Adverse Events, Including Mortality, May Be Increased By A Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen Of 60% Or Higher, And As Robust Evidence Is Lacking For A Beneficial Effect Of A Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen Of 60% Or Higher On Surgical Site Infection, Our Overall Results Suggest That Evidence Is Insufficient To Support The Routine Use Of A High Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen During Anaesthesia And Surgery. Given The Risk Of Attrition And Outcome Reporting Bias, As Well As Other Weaknesses In The Available Evidence, Further Randomized Clinical Trials With Low Risk Of Bias In All Bias Domains, Including A Large Sample Size And Long‐Term Follow‐Up, Are Warranted. Plain Language Summary The Effects Of Giving Adult Patients A High Inspiratory Oxygen Fraction Around The Time Of Surgery Review Question The Normal Air That We Breathe Contains 21% Oxygen. This Systematic Review Assesses The Beneficial And Harmful Effects Of A Percentage Of Inspired Oxygen Of 60% To 90% Compared With A Routine Percentage Of 30% To 40% Given During Anaesthesia, During Surgery And In The Immediate Recovery Period On The Numbers Of Deaths And Surgical Site Infections Reported In Adult Surgical Patients. Background Reduced Lung And Circulatory Function During Surgery Can Lead To Reduced Levels Of Oxygen (Hypoxia). Also, Oxygen Levels Are Often Low In Wounds At The End Of Surgery. This May Impair Bacterial Killing And Wound Healing. Trials And Previous Meta‐Analyses Have Led To Different Conclusions As To Whether A High Percentage Of Inspired Oxygen During Anaesthesia May Decrease Or Increase The Risk Of Death Or Surgical Site Infections. This Systematic Review Used Improved Cochrane Methodology For Carrying Out Systematic Reviews To Reassess Available Evidence Derived From Randomized Clinical Trials. Study Characteristics We Identified 28 Randomized Clinical Trials. Eight Trials With 4918 Participants Reported On Risk Of Death, And 15 Trials With 7219 Participants Reported On Surgical Site Infections Within 14 To 30 Days Of Surgery. Four Trials Reported Serious Adverse Events, Three Trials Respiratory Insufficiency, Nine Trials Length Of Stay During The Associated Hospital Admission And One Trial Quality Of Life. All Trials Were Conducted Without Direct Industry Funding. The Number Of Participants In Each Trial Ranged From 38 To 2012. The Mean Age Of Participants Was 50 Years (Range 15 To 92 Years) And 63% Were Women. Types Of Surgery Included Abdominal Surgery (Eight Trials), Caesarean Section (Four Trials), Breast Surgery (One Trial), Orthopaedic Surgery (Two Trials) And Various Other Surgical Procedures (Four Trials). Key Results A High Percentage Of Inspired Oxygen Was Not Statistically Associated With Increased Risk Of Death, Or With A Decrease In Surgical Site Infections, In All Trials That Measured These Outcomes, In Trials Of Highest Quality And In Those With Longest Follow‐Up. An Increased Risk Of Adverse Events Could Not Be Proved Right Or Wrong For A High Percentage Of Inspired Oxygen During Anaesthesia And Surgery. Quality And Quantity Of The Evidence Only Five Of The Included Trials Had Low Risk Of Bias. The Trials Randomly Assigned 9330 Participants, Of Whom Only 7537 Participants Provided Data For This Review. The Number Of Participants Required To Detect Or Reject A 20% Relative Risk Reduction In Deaths Was Not Reached; Therefore The Observed Results Were Uncertain.",,,

The ingestion of foreign body is a common problem in children, some of which may cause damage or may be associated with toxicity.
Objective
To evaluate and analyze the pattern of foreign bodies in children in the esophagus, ears and nose with review of the techniques for removal in the emergency department.
Methods
From Sept 1, 2008 to May 30, 2010, a review of all children with foreign bodies in the esophagus, ears and in the nose was done to assess the patterns and treatment outcomes. The source and the study group were (N-72). Data concerning socio- demographics, characterization, presenting symptoms and signs, techniques of retrieval and outcomes were extracted and filled in a previously prepared protocol sheet. Descriptive analysis was done using SPSS- computer statistical software.
Results
During the study period, 72 children, victims of foreign bodies in the esophagus, ears and in the nose were included in the study. Of these 44 (61.1%), 28 (38.9%) were male and female children, respectively. The age ranged from 11 months to 14 years with (mean = 4 years). The most affected age group was between 0-5 years accounting for 46 (63.9%) followed by the age group between 6-10 years accounting for 20 (27.8%) of all cases. Males 44 (61.1%) were predominantly most affected than females 28 (38.8%). The location of foreign bodies in this study were in the ears 45 (62.5%), esophagus 17 (23.6%) and in the nose 10 (13.9%) in order of their frequency. Swallowed foreign bodies were successfully removed by Magill forceps. Foreign bodies in the ears and in the nose were removed by careful but different techniques depending on the type and the clinical condition of the patient at time of intervention.
Conclusion
Our study revealed a higher number of patients with foreign bodies in the ears and in the esophagus. Only a small number ofpatients presented with FBS in the nose. Food items in the ears, in the nose and coins in the esophagus were items frequently observed. Early suspicion, early diagnosis and prompt intervention have attributed to reduce morbidities of major events.",,

Generally overlooked in histories of cholera or sanitation, this was the first epidemic to test the new English System and the confidence displayed by antiquarantinists both internationally and at home in the prophylactic capacities of the sanitary zone. Yet as the disease approached, even its most stalwart proponents began to lose their nerve. Their diminished faith in the surety of sanitary surveillance was linked directly to the widespread perception that Eastern European, primarily Jewish, immigrants and transmigrant (en route to America), were the prime conduits of the disease. Temporary measures were aimed directly at the migrants and appeared to contradict the long-standing assertions of antiquarantinists. The chapter explores whether the migrants came to represent a different subset within the categorisation of port diseases, and how they came to represent another notion of space or locality within the sanitary zone.",,

Our Previous Research Examined Determinants Of Hospital Admission, Endoscopy, And Surgery Among Prisoners Who Ingest Foreign Objects. However, Little Is Known About The Financial Impact Of These Events On Healthcare Facilities That Service The Prisoner Population. This Study Aims To Fill This Gap By Examining Hospital Charges Attributable To 435 Prisoner Episodes Of Iifo. Methods: A Retrospective Review Of All Prisoners Who Presented To Our Medical Center With The Complaint Of Iifo Was Conducted. Both Institutional Review Board And Bureau Of Prisons Approvals Were Obtained Before Data Collection. All Prisoners Ages 18-75 Were Included Between The Dates Of January 2004 And December 2011. Episodes Were Divided Into Three Categories: (A) Unverified Iifo Wherein Ingested Object Was Claimed By The Patient But Never Identified; (B) Verified Iifo Wherein Ingested Object Was Clearly Identified; (C) Secondary Events Due To Direct Complications Of Previous Iifo Episode (S). The Temporal Occurrence Of Iifo Was Organized By Increasing The Number Of Episodes And Grouped Accordingly. Detailed List Of Hospital Charges Was Obtained For Every Iifo Episode Including: (A) Emergency Services, (B) Procedures, (C) Laboratory, (D) Surgical Supplies, (E) Allied Health Services, (F) Radiology Studies, (G) Anesthesiology Charges, (H) Pharmacy, And (H) Intensive Care Costs. Descriptive Statistics Were Used To Analyze Basic Data. Kruskal-Wallis Test Was Used To Examine Differences Among Nonnormally Distributed Variables And Sub-Groups. Statistical Significance Set At Alpha = 0.05. Results: A Total Of 435 Iifo Episodes Occurred During The Study Period In A Population Of 125 Patients (Mean Age 33.8 +/- 11.7 Years, Median Age 34 [Range 19-75] Years, 92.8% Male). Hospital Charges Associated With These Episodes Totaled $6,209,557. There Were 94 Unverified Iifos, 332 Verified Iifos, And 9 Secondary Events. Verified Iifos Were Associated With Significantly Greater Median Charges ($5,860) Than Unverified Iifos ($3,997) And Secondary Events Carried Lower Cost ($3,501) Than The Former Two (P < 0.01). We Also Observed A Pattern Of Escalating Costs Associated With Increasing Number Of Sequential Iifo Episodes, With The 1St Episode Carrying Median Charges Of $4,683 And Episodes Numbered 11+ Carrying Median Charges Of $7,698 (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Hospital Charges Associated With The Care Of Prisoners Who Ingest Foreign Objects Tend To Escalate Over Time. Although Charges In Most Of The Categories Demonstrated Increases With Greater Numbers Of Ingestions, The Largest Contributors To This Pattern Of Escalating Charges Included Radiology, Pharmacy, Hospital Room Charges, And Surgical Services. These Findings Suggest That Early Intervention In The Destructive Cycle Of Iifo May Not Only Improve Patient Outcomes But Also Result In Savings To The Healthcare System.

Biomedical engineering history is full of hidden treasures, one of whom is Al-Zahrawi, a Muslim surgeon who had a wide reputation in Europe during the Middle Ages. Herein, besides recalling that he was a surgeon, the intent is to spotlight his talent in biomedical engineering. Important contributions in surgical instruments come up readily in a review of his work, contradicting the view some have maintained of him as a mere compiler. He was a true inventor, creating many surgical instruments that were not known in the Greco-Roman era. Quite early, he produced contributions influencing surgical procedures in Europe from the 14th to the 18th centuries. As a problem solver, he was aware of anatomical and physiological problems, and he moved through design, methods of manufacturing, and practical applications. The illustrations of such instruments in his encyclopedic work, Al-Tasrif, reflect his willingness to teach.",,

The management and clinical course in pediatric patients who had ingested foreign body were investigated retrospectively to evaluate the frequency and factor associated with successful removal of fishbone foreign body.
Methods
Based on the medical records of patients younger than 15 years old who visited emergency room because of foreign body ingestion from January 1999 to December 2012, the authors reviewed clinical characteristics including type of ingested foreign bodies, time to visits, managements and complications.
Results
Fishbone (50.1%) was the most common ingested foreign body in children. Among 416 patients with ingested fishbone, 245 (58.9%) were identified and removed using laryngoscope, rigid or flexible endoscope from pharynx or upper esophagus by otolaryngologists and pediatric gastroenterologists. The kind of ingested fish bone in children was diverse. The mean age of identified and removed fishbone group was 7.39 years old, and higher than that of unidentified fishbone group (5.81 years old, p<0.001). Identified and removed fishbone group had shorter time until hospital visit than the unidentified fishbone group (2.03 vs. 6.47 hours, p<0.001). No complication due to ingested fishbone or procedure occurred.
Conclusion
Older age and shorter time from accident to hospital visit were the different factors between success and failure on removal of ingested fish bone in children.",,

Plain Language Summary Fasting For Haemostasis In Children With Gastrointestinal Bleeding Review Question To Determine The Effects And Safety Of Fasting For Haemostasis In Children With Gastrointestinal Bleeding. Background Gastrointestinal Bleeding Refers To Loss Of Blood From Any Site Of The Digestive Tract. If The Bleeding Site Is Near The Ligament Of Treitz (The Muscle Extending From The Junction Of The Duodenum And Jejunum To The Diaphragm), It Is Described As Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding. If The Bleeding Site Is Away From The Ligament Of Treitz, It Is Described As Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding. People With A Small Amount Of Blood Loss May Have No Symptoms, And Have Bloody Vomiting Or See Blood In The Stool With Increased Bleeding. Chronic Mild Gastrointestinal Bleeding Can Lead To Anaemia, Causing Fatigue Or Pallor; Acute Massive Gastrointestinal Bleeding Can Be Life‐Threatening. Gastrointestinal Bleeding Has Two Scenarios In Children. The First Is A Complaint Of Attending The Emergency Department As A Symptom Of Diseases Such As Ulcers, Gastritis, Mallory‐Weiss Tears, Anorectal Fissures, Allergic Colitis, Infectious Colitis, Intussusception, Henoch‐Schonlein Purpura, And Meckel'S Diverticulum. The Second Occurs In Critically Ill Children Hospitalised In Intensive Care Units And Is Caused By Stress‐Induced Gastropathy. The Incidence Of The First Scenario Has Not Been Well Established, But There Are Substantial Cases In Paediatric Intensive Care Units In The Second Scenario. Whatever The Cause Of Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Fasting Is Believed To Be Necessary Due To The Fear That Eating May Affect Haemostasis Or Aggravate Bleeding.

There Are No Data To Evaluate The Prevalence Of This Phenomenon In Poland. In The United States The Annual Death Rate ...,"Foreign body ingestion is a commonly re-
ported clinical problem. There are no data to
evaluate the prevalence of this phenomenon
in Poland. In the United States the annual
death rate due to foreign body ingestion is
estimated at up to 1500-2700 (1). In 80% of
cases foreign body ingestion is unintentional
and reported in children (2). Among adults
unintentional foreign body ingestion is re-
ported most commonly in the elderly and al-
cohol-dependent patients (3). Some literature
indicates that intentional foreign body inges-
tion among adults accounts for only 10% of all
cases (4), there are however studies suggesting
that intentional foreign body ingestion ac-
counts for up to 92% of all cases of foreign body
ingestion (5). Multiple retrospective studies
confirm consistently that intentional foreign
body ingestions are most commonly reported
in patients with psychiatric disorders, mental
impairment and in prison inmates (4-7).
Considering all cases together, the major-
ity of foreign bodies pass spontaneously,
10-20% require endoscopic intervention and
only 1% are removed surgically (3). Inten-
tional foreign body ingestion is associated
with much more severe consequences, which
require emergency medical intervention in up
to 76% of patients and surgery in 28% of pa-
tients (8).
Foreign body ingestion management de-
pends on the characteristics of the ingested
foreign body, such as: size, shape, presence of
sharp edges, its location, time from ingestion,
severity of clinical symptoms and development
of potential complications (5). on the other
hand the material the foreign body is made of
determines the usefulness of diagnostic tech-
niques (9, 10).
This literature review presents the extent
of intentional foreign body ingestion with re-
gard to risk group characteristics, usefulness
of imaging diagnostics, management options
and prevention of recurrence.",,

Complications Of Pprom Include Prematurity, Chorioamnionitis, Neonatal Sepsis, Limb Position Defects, Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Pulmonary Hypoplasia Chronic Lung Disease, Periventricular Leukomalacia And Intraventricular Haemorrhage. A Number Of Different Sealing Techniques Have Been Employed Which Aim To Restore A Physical Barrier Against Infection And Encourage The Re‐Accumulation Of Amniotic Fluid. Routine Use Of Sealants Is Currently Not Recommended Due To A Lack Of Sufficient Evidence To Support The Safety And Effectiveness Of Such Interventions. Objectives To Assess The Effects Of Sealing Techniques Following Pprom Against Each Other, Or Versus Standard Care (Including No Sealant), On Maternal And Neonatal Outcomes. Search Methods We Searched The Cochrane Pregnancy And Childbirth Group’S Trials Register (30 May 2016) And Reference Lists Of Retrieved Studies. Selection Criteria Randomised And Quasi‐Randomised Controlled Trials Comparing Different Techniques For Sealing Preterm Prelabour Ruptured Membranes. Cluster‐Randomised Trials And Trials Using A Cross‐Over Design Were Not Eligible For Inclusion In This Review. We Planned To Include Abstracts When Sufficient Information Was Provided. Data Collection And Analysis Two Review Authors Independently Assessed Trials For Inclusion And Assessed Trial Quality. Two Review Authors Independently Extracted Data. Data Were Checked For Accuracy. Main Results We Included Two Studies (Involving 141 Women ‐ With Data From 124 Women). We Considered Both Studies As Being At High Risk Of Bias. Meta‐Analysis Was Not Possible Because The Included Studies Examined Different Interventions (Both In Comparison With Standard Care) And Reported On Few, But Different, Outcomes. One Study Compared Cervical Adapter (Mechanical Sealing), And The Other Study Examined An Immunological Membrane Sealant. Neither Of The Included Studies Reported On This Review'S Primary Outcome Of Interest ‐ Perinatal Mortality. Similarly, Data Were Not Reported For The Majority Of This Review'S Secondary Infant And Maternal Outcomes. Cervical Adapter (Mechanical Sealing) Versus Standard Care (One Study, Data From 35 Participants) No Data Were Reported For This Review'S Primary Outcome ‐  Perinatal Mortality . Data Were Reported For Few Of This Review'S Infant Or Maternal Secondary Outcomes. There Was No Clear Difference Between The Mechanical Sealing Group And The Standard Care Control In Relation To The Incidence Of  Neonatal Sepsis  (Risk Ratio (Rr) 1.19, 95% Confidence Interval (Ci) 0.28 To 5.09 ( Very Low‐Quality Evidence )) Or  Chorioamnionitis  (Rr 1.19, 95% Ci 0.28 To 5.09 ( Very Low‐Quality Evidence )). Oral Immunological Membrane Sealant Versus Standard Care (One Study, Data From 94 Participants) No Data Were Available For  Perinatal Mortality  (This Review'S Primary Outcome) Or For The Majority Of This Review'S Infant And Maternal Secondary Outcomes. Compared To Standard Care, The Immunological Membrane Sealant Was Associated With A Reduction In  Preterm Birth Less Than 37 Weeks  (Rr 0.48, 95% Ci 0.34 To 0.68 ( Very Low‐Quality Evidence )) And A Reduction In  Neonatal Death  (Rr 0.38, 95% Ci 0.19 To 0.75 ( Very Low‐Quality Evidence) ). However, There Was No Clear Difference Between Groups In Terms Of  Neonatal Sepsis  (Rr 0.64, 95% Ci 0.28 To 1.46 ( Very Low‐Quality Evidence )) Or  Respiratory Distress Syndrome  (Rr 0.64, 95% Ci 0.28 To 1.46 ( Very Low‐Quality Evidence )). Authors' Conclusions There Is Insufficient Evidence To Evaluate Sealing Procedures For Pprom. There Were No Data Relating To This Review'S Primary Outcome (Perinatal Mortality) And The Majority Of Our Infant And Maternal Secondary Outcomes Were Not Reported In The Two Included Studies. There Was Limited Evidence To Suggest That An Immunological Membrane Sealant Was Associated With A Reduction In Preterm Birth At Less Than 37 Weeks And Neonatal Death, But These Results Should Be Interpreted With Caution As This Is Based On One Small Study, With A High Risk Of Bias, And The Intervention Has Not Been Tested In Other Studies. Although Midtrimester Pprom Is Not A Rare Occurrence, There Are Only A Small Amount Of Published Data Addressing The Benefits And Risks Of Sealing Procedures. Most Of These Studies Are Retrospective And Cohort Based And Could Therefore Not Be Included In Our Data‐Analysis. This Review Highlights The Paucity Of Prospective Randomised Trials In This Area. Current Evidence Provides Limited Information Both On Effectiveness And Safety For The Interventions Described. Given The Paucity Of High‐Quality Data, We Recommend That Future Research Efforts Focus On The Conduct Of Randomised Trials Assessing The Effect Of Promising Interventions That Have Been Only Evaluated To Date In Cohort Studies (E.G. Amniopatch). Future Trials Should Address Outcomes Including Perinatal Mortality, Preterm Birth, Neonatal Death, Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Neonatal Sepsis And Developmental Delay. They Should Also Evaluate Maternal Outcomes Including Sepsis, Mode Of Delivery, Length Of Hospital Stay And Emotional Well‐Being. Plain Language Summary Treatments For Improving Outcomes For Mother And Baby When The Waters Have Broken Too Early What Is The Issue? Preterm Prelabour Rupture Of The Membranes (Pprom) Is When The Waters Break At Less Than 37 Weeks' Gestation. It Occurs In One In 50 Pregnancies And Can Happen Spontaneously Or After A Medical Procedure Has Been Performed, For Example, Tests Where A Needle Is Placed In To The Womb To Get A Sample Of Fluid Or Tissue, Or After An Operation Has Been Performed On The Baby Inside The Womb. Why Is This Important? Breaking Of The Waters Early In Pregnancy Can Lead To Significant Problems Including The Baby Being Born Too Soon To Survive, Having Immature Lungs, And Serious Infections. Preterm Babies Are Overall More Likely To Be Ill And To Suffer From Long‐Term Disabilities, If They Do Survive. The Survival Of Babies Affected By Pprom Is Related To How Early It Occurs In The Pregnancy And If An Infection Occurs. In Some Circumstances, The Waters May Reseal Themselves. This Is More Likely To Occur When No Infection Is Present. Several Treatments To Reseal The Membranes Have Been Tried, With Varying Success. Resealing Has Been Attempted By: A) Injecting Clotting Factors And Other Medicines In To The Hole In The Womb To Create A Patch Over The Area That Is Leaking; B) Taking Tablets That May Stimulate The Body’S Immune System To Mend The Area Where The Seal Has Broken; C) Placing A Sponge Over The Hole In The Waters; D) Placing A Seal Over The Neck Of The Womb To Stop Fluid Leaking Out And Prevent Infection. Our Study Is Important Because Finding A Successful Treatment For Pprom May Reduce The Potential Complications That May Happen To The Mother And Baby Such As Preterm Birth (Being Born Before 37 Weeks' Gestation) And Infections. What Did We Find? In Our Study We Assessed The Different Techniques Used For Resealing The Waters. We Aimed To Compare The Survival Of Babies Affected With This Condition Before And After Birth And Look At The Rates Of Complications In Both The Babies And Mothers. We Searched For Trials (30 May 2016) And Found Two Studies That Compared Treatments For Resealing The Membranes After They Had Broken. These Trials Involved 141 Women In Total And Compared Two Completely Different Modes Of Treatment. One Trial Compared The Use Of An Oral Immunological Membrane Sealant To Stimulate The Body’S Immune System To Mend The Area Where The Seal Has Broken And The Other Trial Placed A Mechanical Sealing Device Over The Cervix (Neck Of The Womb) To Stop Fluid Leaking. Unfortunately, Neither Trial Provided Any Data Relating To Death Of The Baby Within The Womb Or In The First 28 Days Of Life (Perinatal Mortality). There Was Limited Evidence To Suggest That Oral Immunological Membrane Sealant Was Associated With A Fewer Babies Being Before 37 Weeks’ Gestation And A Reduction In The Number Of Babies That Died Within The First 28 Days. However, These Results Are Based On  Very Low‐Quality Evidence  From One Small Trial (With Data From 94 Women) That We Judged To Be At A High Risk Of Bias. There Was No Clear Difference Between The Mechanical Sealing Device Group And The Control Group In Relation To The Number Of Babies Who Contracted A Serious Infection (Neonatal Sepsis) Or Chorioamnionitis (A Bacterial Infection That Causes Inflammation Of The Membranes Surrounding The Baby In The Womb). Although These Results Are Based On  Very Low‐Quality Evidence  From One Small Trial (Involving 35 Women) Judged To Be At A High Risk Of Bias. What Does This Mean? Overall, Our Question Remains Unanswered ‐ We Do Not Have Enough Data To Fully Evaluate Sealing Procedures For Pprom. This Review Demonstrates The Lack Of Research In This Area Regarding The Effectiveness And Safety Of Potential Treatments For Pprom. We Recommend That More Research Is Needed To Look At The Different Techniques For Sealing Broken Waters And That This Research Should Focus On The Effectiveness Of The Treatment In Improving Overall Outcomes. The Safety Of The Treatments To Both Mother And Baby Must Be Further Evaluated Before Sealing Techniques Can Be Recommended To Prevent Adverse Outcomes.",,,

unintentional foreign body ingestion is re-

confirm consistently that intentional foreign

in patients with psychiatric disorders, mental
impairment and in prison inmates (4-7).
Considering all cases together, the major-
ity of foreign bodies pass spontaneously,
10-20% require endoscopic intervention and
only 1% are removed surgically (3). Inten-

with much more severe consequences, which
require emergency medical intervention in up

Foreign body ingestion management de-

foreign body, such as: size, shape, presence of
sharp edges, its location, time from ingestion,
severity of clinical symptoms and development
of potential complications (5). on the other

The primary goal was to assess the clinical efficacy (rate of healing) of administered Procellera in conjunction with the standard-of-care (SOC) treatment, moleskin and Tegaderm , on the healing rate of blisters compared with the SOC treatment alone. The secondary end points for efficacy were the quantities of wound fluid biomarkers and bacterial bioburden. The tertiary end point was assessment of pain in the treatment group compared with that of the control group during the 2-week study. The results showed no statistical difference between the SOC and SOC+Procellera groups in wound healing and pain. Wound fluid was reported for 24 participants (64.9%) in the SOC group and 21 participants (56.8%) in SOC+Procellera group at the baseline measurement (_ = .475); however, the wounds were devoid of fluid on follow-up visits. The mild nature of the wounds in this study was apparent by the low pain scores at the beginning of the study, which disappeared by the follow-up visits. The average wound sizes were 2.2cm2 and 1.5cm2 for the SOC and SOC+Procellera groups, respectively. This trial protocol should be conducted on open softtissue wounds in severe heat. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical study conducted within the US Army Rangers training doctrine. ",,

Case Presentation: A 46-Year-Old  Woman With A History Of Depression Presented To The Emergency Department After An  Intentional Medication Overdose And Ingestion Of Two Japanese 1-Yen Coins. She  Complained Of Persistent Retrosternal Discomfort. In Order To Confirm Whether The  Coins Were In The Oesophagus Or Trachea, An Anteroposterior Chest Radiograph Was  Obtained; However, No Coins Were Detected. Owing To Her Persistent Symptoms, A  Chest Ct Was Performed. On The Initial Ct Scan, Two 1-Yen Coins Were Observed In  The Oesophagus: One In The Middle Oesophagus And The Other In The Lower  Oesophagus. After The Scanning, The Patient Drank Water With Permission, But  Vomited. No Coins Were Found In Her Vomit, And The Symptoms Of Retrosternal  Discomfort Had Completely Disappeared. A Subsequent Ct Scan Revealed That The Two  1-Yen Coins Were In The Patient'S Stomach. Conclusions: Japanese 1-Yen Coins Are  Made Of 100% Aluminium, Which Is Less Radiopaque Than The Metals That Make Up  Coins (Nickel, Bronze, And Lead), And So, They Were Not Visible Via Chest  Radiography In Our Case. Detecting Very Small Or Thin Radiolucent Foreign Bodies  Is Not Possible Using A Chest Radiograph Or Contrast Oesophagram, But Is Possible  Via Ct.

It is a common phenomenon and occurs in otherwise normal individuals several times during the day and night, especially after ingestion of fluids, e.g., soup, tea, coffee, or milk. The esophagus is a muscular tubular organ responsible for the transport of food from the mouth to the stomach. The esophagus has a parasympathetic innervation through the vagus nerve, which runs along the esophagus. Sympathetic innervation arises from postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic chain. Once food enters the esophagus, it is transported by a propulsive peristaltic wave into the stomach. Pathological reflux in this age group may be characterized by different symptoms. The most typical reported signs are regurgitation and effortless leak-out of milk or food after meals, between meals, and when asleep.",,

Whilst Resorbable Plates Appear To Offer Clinical Advantages Over Metal Plates In Orthognathic Surgery, Concerns Remain About The Stability Of Fixation And The Length Of Time Required For Their Degradation And The Possibility Of Foreign Body Reactions. This Review Compares The Use Of Titanium Versus Bioresorbable Plates In Orthognathic Surgery And Is An Update Of The Cochrane Review First Published In 2007. Objectives To Compare The Effects Of Bioresorbable Fixation Systems With Titanium Systems Used During Orthognathic Surgery. Search Methods Cochrane Oral Health'S Information Specialist Searched The Following Databases: Cochrane Oral Health'S Trials Register (To 20 January 2017); The Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials (Central; 2016, Issue 11) In The Cochrane Library (Searched 20 January 2017); Medline Ovid (1946 To 20 January 2017); And Embase Ovid (1980 To 20 January 2017).

No Restrictions Were Placed On The Language Or Date Of Publication When Searching The Electronic Databases. Selection Criteria Randomised Controlled Trials Comparing Bioresorbable Versus Titanium Fixation Systems Used For Orthognathic Surgery In Adults. Data Collection And Analysis Two Review Authors Independently Screened The Results Of The Electronic Searches, Extracted Data And Assessed The Risk Of Bias Of The Included Studies. We Resolved Disagreement By Discussion. Clinical Heterogeneity Between The Included Trials Precluded Pooling Of Data, And Only A Descriptive Summary Is Presented. Main Results This Review Included Two Trials, Involving 103 Participants, One Comparing Titanium With Resorbable Plates And Screws And The Other Titanium With Resorbable Screws. Both Studies Were At High Risk Of Bias And Provided Very Limited Data For The Primary Outcomes Of This Review. All Participants In One Trial Suffered Mild To Moderate Postoperative Discomfort With No Statistically Significant Difference Between The Two Plating Groups At Different Follow‐Up Times. Mean Scores Of Patient Satisfaction Were 7.43 To 8.63 (Range 0 To 10) With No Statistically Significant Difference Between The Two Groups Throughout Follow‐Up. Adverse Effects Reported In One Study Were Two Plate Exposures In Each Group Occurring Between The Third And Ninth Months. Plate Exposures Occurred Mainly In The Posterior Maxillary Region, Except For One Titanium Plate Exposure In The Mandibular Premolar Region. Known Causes Of Infection Were Associated With Loosened Screws And Wound Dehiscence With No Statistically Significant Difference In The Infection Rate Between Titanium (3/196), And Resorbable (3/165) Plates. Authors' Conclusions We Do Not Have Sufficient Evidence To Determine If Titanium Plates Or Resorbable Plates Are Superior For Fixation Of Bones After Orthognathic Surgery. This Review Provides Insufficient Evidence To Show Any Difference In Postoperative Pain And Discomfort, Level Of Patient Satisfaction, Plate Exposure Or Infection For Plate And Screw Fixation Using Either Titanium Or Resorbable Materials. Plain Language Summary Resorbable Versus Titanium Plates For Corrective Jaw Surgery Review Question Are Resorbable (Biodegradable) Plates Better Than Titanium (Metal) Plates For The Fixation Of Facial Bones After Corrective (Orthognathic) Jaw Surgery? Background Under‐ Or Overgrowth Of One Or Both Of The Jaw Bones Can Lead To Reduced Function And An Unattractive Facial Appearance, Either Of Which May Have Lasting And Significant Psychosocial Effects. Treatment Of Severe Cases May Require A Combination Of Orthodontic Appliances And Orthognathic (Corrective Jaw) Surgery. After Surgery The Cut Bone Needs To Be Immobilised To Ensure That Optimal Healing Takes Place. Titanium Plates Used For Fixation Are Recognised To Be The 'Gold Standard' But Recent Developments In Biomaterials Have Led To An Increased Use Of Bioresorbable Plates Or Screws For Corrective Jaw Surgery. The Use Of Bioresorbable Plates For The Fixation Of Facial Bones Might Appear To Reduce The Need For A Further Operation For The Removal Of Metal Plates. However, Whilst Resorbable Plates Do Appear To Offer Certain Advantages Over Metal Plates, Concerns Remain About The Stability Of Fixation, The Length Of Time Required For Their Resorption (Being Reabsorbed), The Possibility Of Foreign Body Reactions, And With Some Of The Technical Difficulties Experienced With Resorbable Plates. Study Characteristics We Included Two Studies That Analysed A Total Of 103 Participants. The Evidence In This Review Is Up To Date As Of 20 January 2017. Study Participants Were Adults Older Than 16 Years Of Age. One Study Compared Titanium With Resorbable Plates And Screws And The Other Titanium With Resorbable Screws. One Study Was Conducted In China, The Other In Germany. Key Results Both Studies Were At High Risk Of Bias And Provided Very Limited Data. We Do Not Have Sufficient Evidence To Determine If Titanium Plates Or Resorbable Plates Are Superior For The Fixation Of Bones After Corrective Jaw Surgery.

Iifos Often Require Surgical Or Endoscopic Interventions, Extended Hospital Stays, And May Result In Significant Morbidity Or Even Mortality. Although Psychiatric Illness Is Prevalent Among Prisoners Engaging In Iifo, This Association Remains Poorly Defined. The Aim Of This Study Is To Describe The Psychiatric Illness Profile Among Prisoners Diagnosed With Iifo. We Hypothesized That Repeated Episodes Of Iifo Are Associated With An Escalating Pattern Of Documented Psychiatric Illness. Methods: After Approvals Were Obtained From Our Institutional Review Board And The Ohio Department Of Rehabilitation And Correction, A Retrospective Study Was Conducted Of Prisoners Presenting To Our Facility With Iifo Between 2004 And 2011. All Historical And Concurrent Psychiatric Diagnoses Were Abstracted From The Medical Record And Classified Into Diagnostic And Statistical Manual Of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition Based Categories. In Addition, Medical History, Alcohol/Drug Use, And Prior Episodes Of Iifo Were Recorded. Statistical Analyses Included Chi-Square And Kruskal-Wallis Tests For Categorical And Continuous Data, Respectively. Results: We Analyzed 136 Iifo Episodes Involving 27 Patients. Repeat Iifo Episodes Were Associated With An Increasing Number Of Psychiatric Diagnoses. Patients With Their Fifth Or Later Iifo Had A Larger Number Of Psychiatric Diagnoses And The Number Of Objects Ingested As Compared To Patients Presenting With A First Episode (P < 0.01). Similarly, Patients Who Went On To Present With Additional Episodes Of Iifo During The Study Had More Psychiatric Diagnoses Identified Throughout Their Visits (P < 0.01). The Proportion Of Patients With Mood And Anxiety Disorders (Including Post-Traumatic Stress) Was Progressively Greater Among Prisoners With Recurrent Episodes Of Iifo (P < 0.05). Other Psychiatric Disorders Were Not Significantly Associated With Iifo Escalation. Conclusions: We Observed A Significant Association Between Iifo Recurrences And Increases In Both The Quantity Of Ingested Items And The Number Of Documented Psychiatric Diagnoses. Of Note, Psychiatric Diagnoses Of Malingering Or Secondary Gain Were Not Identified In The Current Patient Sample. Consideration Of Early Psychiatric Evaluation And Intervention In The Setting Of Iifo, Especially Recurrent Iifo, Is Strongly Encouraged.

This Study Aimed To Analyse The Circumstances Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts In A Japanese Psychiatric Hospital So As To Improve Management And Care. Methods: Incident Reports Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts During A 12.4-Year Period From November 2000 To March 2013 Were Reviewed. A Descriptive Analysis Was Conducted In Terms Of Age, Sex, And Diagnosis Of Patients, As Well As Level, Ward, Situations, And Causes Of Incidents. Results: During The Study Period, 90 Cases Of Self-Harm And Attempted Suicide Involving 58 Patients Were Reported. The Rate Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts Was 0.05 Per 1000 Patient-Days. The Types Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts Included Hanging (N = 25), Wrist Cutting (N = 19), Ingestion Of Foreign Objects (N = 17), And Others (N = 29). The Single Case Of Completed Suicide Involved Hanging, In A Patient With Schizophrenia. Among 55 Patients With Relevant Data, The Most Common Clinical Diagnosis Was Mood Disorder (41.8%), Followed By Schizophrenia (36.4%). Mood Disorder Was 3.5 Times As Prevalent In Females As In Males (14 Vs. 4). Fourteen Patients With Mood Disorder (N = 8) Or Schizophrenia (N = 6) Were Repeatedly Involved In 46 Of 89 Cases Of Self-Harm Or Attempted Suicide; 11 Were Female. One Woman With Mood Disorder Attempted Suicide 9 Times Within The Same Year. The Top 3 Management And Care Factors Related To Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts Were Failure To Adhere To Preventive Procedures (28%), Insufficient Therapeutic Communication (28%), And Difficulty In Predicting Suicide (20%). Conclusion: Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts At This Psychiatric Hospital Occurred At A Rate Of 0.05 Per 1000 Patient-Days Between Late 2000 And Early 2013.

In China, There Have Been A Few Studies Investigating The Prevalence Of Dsh In Heroin-Dependent Patients (Hdps), But Their Rates Varied Widely. We Thus Conducted A Meta-Analysis Of Studies Assessing The Prevalence Of Dsh Among Chinese Hdps. Methods: Relevant Studies Were Retrieved From Major Chinese Databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, And Sinomed) And Western Databases (Pubmed, Embase, And Psycinfo). Two Authors Independently Identified Eligible Studies And Extracted Data. Studies That Included A Representative Sample Of Chinese Hdps And Ascertained Dsh Caseness In A Reliable Way Were Considered As High Quality. Statistical Analysis Was Performed Using R Software. Results: In Total, 15 Eligible Studies With A Total Of 37,243 Chinese Hdps Were Included. All Included Studies Were Conducted In Heroin Detoxification Settings. Only Two Studies Were Rated As High Quality. The Pooled Prevalence Of Dsh In Chinese Hdps Was 4.4% (95%Ci: 2.9, 6.2%), But The Heterogeneity Of Prevalence Rates Across Studies Was Significant (I2 = 98%, P < 0.001). Studies Rated As High Quality Had Significantly Higher Prevalence Of Dsh Than Those Rated As Low Quality (13.2 Vs. 3.4%, P < 0.001). Swallowing Foreign Objects Was The Most Common Method Of Dsh, With A Combined Prevalence Of 2.7% (95%Ci: 1.6, 4.4%). Extreme Dsh Methods Such As Cutting Offfingers And Jumping From Height Were Also Not Uncommon In This Patient Population. Conclusion: Due To Methodological Problems In Available Studies, We Find A Relatively Low Prevalence Of Dsh Among Chinese Hdps Receiving Detoxification Treatment. Nevertheless, The Self-Harmers Of Chinese Hdps Are More Likely To Harm Themselves In A Dangerous Or Life-Threatening Way. Restricting The Availability Of Dsh Methods May Be An Effective Way To Prevent Or Reduce Dsh In China'S Detoxification Treatment Settings. © 2018 Zhong, Xu, Xie, Chen And Lu.",,,

lated to esophagus burns and complications as a result of swallow-
ing an alkaline battery. The main purpose of this case presentation
was to discuss the autopsy findings of late-developing complications
of swallowing an alkali battery in the light of the relevant literature.
On the chest radiography of a 9-month old baby with complaints
of vomiting for three days, an opacity was observed consistent with
a foreign body in the esophagus. Esophagoscopy was applied and
the swallowed battery was removed. On the fifth day after the opera-
tion, no complication has been observed to oral feeding was started
and on the following day the patient was discharged. Four days after
discharge, the patient was again brought to hospital with complaints
of blood in vomit and was again hospitalized with a diagnosis of
chemical esophageal burn. The patient died on the following day.
In the performed autopsy, findings of esophagotracheal fistula, cor-
rosive burn and gastrointestinal system bleeding were determined.
As the dimensions of an alkaline battery increase, the contact
surface increases and may this cause greater damage and toxicity. A
long contact period also increases the toxic effect of the battery. Ear-
ly diagnosis is essential to prevent late-developing complications.",,

We Describe A Case Of  Diphenhydramine Overdose Leading To Cardiac Arrest, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation  (Cpr), And Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (Ecmo) Cannulation For Refractory  Ventricular Fibrillation, A Process We Refer To As Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary  Resuscitation (Ecpr). Case Report: Responding To A Call For Altered Mental  Status, Emergency Medical Service (Ems) Personnel Found An Unconscious And  Seizing 17-Year-Old Male. He Had Reportedly Developed Generalized Tonic-Clonic  Seizures And Dysrhythmias After Ingesting Approximately 800 25-Mg Diphenhydramine  Tablets. He Was Transferred To Our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (Picu) After  Stabilization At A Local Emergency Center. After Approximately 7 Hours Of  Clinical Stability And Normalization Of Cardiac Rhythm, Electrolytes, And  Acidosis, He Developed Renewed Seizure Activity And Accelerated Ventricular  Rhythm Leading To Hemodynamic Collapse And Cardiac Arrest. He Was Cannulated For  Veno-Arterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (Vaecmo) With Cpr In Progress.

It Affects Millions Of International Travelers To Developing Countries Annually And Can Significantly Disrupt Travel Plans. Objective: To Provide An Update On The Evaluation, Diagnosis, Treatment, And Prevention Of Traveler'S Diarrhea. Methods: A Pubmed Search Was Completed In Clinical Queries Using The Key Term Traveler'S Diarrhea. The Search Strategy Included Meta-Analyses, Randomized Controlled Trials, Clinical Trials, Observational Studies, And Reviews. The Search Was Restricted To English Literature. Patents Were Searched Using The Key Term Traveler'S Diarrhea From Www.Freepatentsonline.Com. Results: Between 10% And 40% Of Travelers Develop Diarrhea. The Attack Rate Is Highest For Travelers From A Developed Country Who Visit A Developing Country. Children Are At Particular Risk. Travelers' Diarrhea Is Usually Acquired Through Ingestion Of Food And Water Contaminated By Feces. Most Cases Are Due To A Bacterial Pathogen, Commonly, Escherichia Coli, And Occur Within The First Few Days After Arrival In A Foreign Country. Dehydration Is The Most Common Complication. Pretravel Education On Hygiene And On The Safe Selection Of Food Items Is Important In Minimizing Episodes. For Mild Travelers' Diarrhea, The Use Of Antibiotic Is Not Recommended. The Use Of Bismuth Subsalicylate Or Loperamide May Be Considered. For Moderate Travelers' Diarrhea, Antibiotics Such As Fluoroquinolones, Azithromycin, And Rifaximin May Be Used. Loperamide May Be Considered As Monotherapy Or Adjunctive Therapy. For Severe Travelers' Diarrhea, Antibiotics Such As Azithromycin, Fluoroquinolones, And Rifaximin Should Be Used. Azithromycin Can Be Used Even For The Treatment Of Dysentery Whereas Fluoroquinolones And Rifaximin Cannot Be Used For Such Purpose. Recent Patents Related To The Management Of Travelers' Diarrhea Are Discussed. Conclusion: Although Travelers' Diarrhea Is Usually Self-Limited, Many Travelers Prefer Expedient Relief Of Diarrhea, Especially When They Are Traveling For Extended Periods By Air Or Ground. Judicious Use Of An Antimotility Agent And Antimicrobial Therapy Reduces The Duration And Severity Of Diarrhea.",,,

Diagnosis And Treatment Options For Ep Are Limited ...,"BACKGROUND: Esophageal perforation (EP) is a lethal surgical emergency that needs to be diagnosed and treated immediately.
Diagnosis and treatment options for EP are limited due to its lower incidence. There are scoring systems proposed for this purpose;
however, they cannot be applied to every patient. The recent trend in the treatment of EP is toward the non-operative approach over the
surgical treatment methods. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate our treatment methods and outcomes in patients with EP.
METHODS: Thirteen patients with EP treated in our clinic between 2013 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. The Pittsburgh
Perforation Severity Score (PSS), systemic condition status, and ClavienDindo Classification (CDC) score were assessed, and treatment
methods were reviewed. Their effects on morbidity and mortality were examined using Fishers exact test and biserial correlation test.
RESULTS: A total of 13 patients (six males and seven females; median age 64 years) were included in the study. Ten patients were
managed non-operative, and three were treated surgically. Of the 10 patients, two had additional surgery after non-operative manage-
ment. The PSS, systemic condition status, CDC score, duration of stay in the hospital, time to diagnosis, presence of hypotension, and
being in shock were strongly correlated with mortality (p<0.05). The PSS, CDC score, and stay in the intensive care unit were strongly
correlated with morbidity (p<0.05). The comparison between the non-operative and operative groups did not yield a statistically
significant difference in mortality and morbidity.
CONCLUSION: Even if the scoring systems help to understand the severity of the condition, they are inadequate to determine the
treatment option. Early diagnosis and treatment are the most important steps in management. Operative and non-operative treatment
options are not superior to each other, but their complementary use will be more beneficial for the patients.

Objectives: To Determine The Proportion Of Children And The  Factors Associated With Repeat Presentations To The Red Cross War Memorial  Children'S Hospital Trauma Unit (Rcwmch Tu) In Cape Town, South Africa, For All  Non-Transport-Related Injuries In Childhood. Methods: This Was A Retrospective  Cohort Study Using Data From The Rcwmch Tu. We Included Children Aged 0 - 10  Years With First Presentation From January 1997 To June 2013 And Followed Up  Until The Earlier Of Age 13 Years Or June 2016. We Assessed Individual And  Population-Level Factors Associated With Repeat Injury Using Multilevel Poisson  Regression Analysis. Child Dependency Ratios Were Derived From The 2011 National  Census. Results: Between 1997 And 2013, 72 490 Children Aged &Lt;10 Years (59%  Male) Presented To The Rcwmch Tu For The First Time With Injuries.

Endoscopic methods [endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)] are useful tools to diagnose and manage
chronic pancreatitis. Pediatric knowledge and use of these modalities is
limited and warrants dissemination.
Methods: Literature review of publications relating to use of ERCP and EUS
for diagnosis and/or management of chronic pancreatitis with special attention
to studies involving 018 years old subjects was conducted with summaries
generated. Recommendations were developed and voted upon by authors.
Results: Both EUS and ERCP can be used even in small children to assist in
diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in cases where cross-sectional imaging is
not sufficient to diagnose or characterize the disease. Children under 15 kg
for EUS and 10 kg for ERCP can be technically challenging. These
procedures should be done optimally by appropriately trained endoscopists
and adult gastroenterology providers with appropriate experience treating
children. EUS and ERCP-related risks both include perforation, bleeding and
pancreatitis. EUS is the preferred diagnostic modality over ERCP because of
lower complication rates overall. Both modalities can be used for management
of chronic pancreatitis -related fluid collections. ERCP has successfully been
used to manage pancreatic duct stones.
Conclusion: EUS and ERCP can be safely used to diagnose chronic pancreatitis
in pediatric patients and assist in management of chronic pancreatitis-related
complications. Procedure-related risks are similar to those seen in adults, with
EUS having a safer risk profile overall. The recent increase in pediatric-trained
specialists will improve access of these modalities for children.",,

We Retrospectively Analysed ...","ABSTRACT: Ingestion of abnormal materials by cetaceans has been reported worldwide, but few studies have investigated the causes of foreign material ingestion. We retrospectively analysed necropsies performed between 2012 and 2019 on 88 cetaceans stranded along the coast of Catalonia, Spain, and evaluated the association of abnormal ingested materials with 2 risk factors, namely disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and maternal separation. Abnormal materials were found in the digestive tract in 19 of 88 (21.6%) cetaceans; of these, 13 (60%) had lesions in the CNS, such as morbilliviral encephalitis, neurobrucellosis or encephalomalacia, and 3 were diagnosed as having experienced maternal separation. In a logistic regression model, CNS lesions and maternal separation were identified as risk factors for ingestion of foreign material, but with wide confidence intervals, probably due to the small sample size. In contrast, abnormal ingestion was not identified in any of the 25 (28%) cetaceans whose cause of death was attributed to interaction with humans. Abnormal ingestion should be interpreted with caution, and efforts should be made at necropsy to exclude CNS diseases through pathologic and microbiologic investigations. If disease of the CNS is a significant risk factor for ingestion of marine debris by small odontocetes, results of monitoring programmes may be biased by the prevalence of CNS disease in a specific area or population.

If The Bolus Does Not Pass Spontaneously, Then The Patient Is At Risk Of Aspiration, Dehydration, Perforation, And Death. Definitive Management Is With Endoscopic Intervention, Recommended Within 24 Hours. Prior To Endoscopy, Many Patients Undergo A Period Of Observation, Awaiting Spontaneous Disimpaction, Or May Undergo Enteral Or Parenteral Treatments To Attempt To Dislodge The Bolus. There Is Little Consensus As To Which Of These Conservative Strategies Is Safe And Effective To Be Used In This Initial Period, Before Resorting To Definitive Endoscopic Management For Persistent Impaction. Objectives To Evaluate The Efficacy Of Non‐Endoscopic Conservative Treatments In The Management Of Soft Food Boluses Impacted Within The Oesophagus. Search Methods We Searched The Following Databases, Using Relevant Search Terms: Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials (Central), Medline, Embase And Cinahl. The Date Of The Search Was 18 August 2019. We Screened The Reference Lists Of Relevant Studies And Reviews On The Topic To Identify Any Additional Studies. Selection Criteria We Included Randomised Controlled Trials Of The Management Of Acute Oesophageal Soft Food Bolus Impaction, In Adults And Children, Reporting The Incidence Of Disimpaction (Confirmed Radiologically Or Clinically By Return To Oral Diet) Without The Need For Endoscopic Intervention. We Did Not Include Studies Focusing On Sharp Or Solid Object Impaction. Data Collection And Analysis We Used Standard Methodological Procedures Recommended By Cochrane. Main Results We Identified 890 Unique Records Through The Electronic Searches. We Excluded 809 Clearly Irrelevant Records And Retrieved 81 Records For Further Assessment. We Subsequently Included One Randomised Controlled Trial That Met The Eligibility Criteria, Which Was Conducted In Four Swedish Centres And Randomised 43 Participants To Receive Either Intravenous Diazepam Followed By Glucagon, Or Intravenous Placebos. The Effect Of The Active Substances Compared With Placebo On Rates Of Disimpaction Without Intervention Is Uncertain, As The Numbers From This Single Study Were Small, And The Rates Were Similar (38% Versus 32%; Risk Ratio 1.19, 95% Confidence Interval 0.51 To 2.75, P = 0.69). The Certainty Of The Evidence Using Grade For This Outcome Is Low. Data On Adverse Events Were Lacking. Authors' Conclusions There Is Currently Inadequate Data To Recommend The Use Of Any Enteral Or Parenteral Treatments In The Management Of Acute Oesophageal Soft Food Bolus Impaction. There Is Also Inadequate Data Regarding Potential Adverse Events From The Use Of These Treatments, Or From Potential Delays In Definitive Endoscopic Management. Caution Should Be Exercised When Using Any Conservative Management Strategies In These Patients. Plain Language Summary Use Of Treatments To Dislodge Soft Foods Stuck Between The Throat And The Stomach To Try To Avoid The Need For An Endoscopy Review Question Can A Period Of Observation, Treatment With Swallowed Substances, Or Treatment With Substances Given Via The Blood Help To Dislodge Soft Foods That Are Stuck Between The Throat And The Stomach In Order To Avoid The Need For An Endoscopic Procedure To Clear It? Background Food Can Sometimes Get Stuck In The Oesophagus, The Pipe Connecting The Throat To The Stomach That Passes Through The Chest. This Food Often Dislodges On Its Own, Without Any Medical Help, But Occasionally A Doctor'S Help Is Needed To Clear It. Removing Or Dislodging These Lumps Of Food Can Be Done Using A Flexible Camera Or A Rigid Instrument, Called An Endoscope, But Endoscopic Procedures Can Have Serious Complications, Like Causing Holes In The Oesophagus. However, Waiting For Too Long For The Food To Clear On Its Own Can Also Increase The Risk Of A Hole In The Oesophagus And May Lead To Saliva Or Food Falling Into The Lungs, Causing Serious Infections. A Variety Of Treatments Are Currently Used To Try To Clear The Food, Without Having To Resort To An Endoscopy, Many Of Which Also Have Potential Side Effects, Including Difficulty Breathing, Increased Blood Sugar Levels, Low Blood Pressure, And Irregular Heartbeat. We Wanted To Know If Any Of These Treatments Were Better Than Simply Waiting For The Food To Clear On Its Own, Before Trying To Dislodge It With Instruments. Study Characteristics The Evidence Is Current To August 2019. We Found One Trial Suitable To Answer Our Question, Which Compared Giving A Patient Two Drugs Into A Vein In (Diazepam And Glucagon) To Placebos (Clear Liquids Which Appeared Similar To The Drugs But Have No Effect On The Body). We Did Not Look At Treating Sharp Or Hard Objects, As These Are Treated Differently. Key Results There Was Not Enough Evidence To Say With Certainty Which Treatments For Food Impacted In The Oesophagus Are Safe Or Effective. Quality Of The Evidence We Graded The Overall Certainty Of The Evidence As Low. More Studies With More Participants Are Needed To Be Able To Answer The Review Question.",,,

We Hypothesized That For Children  Presenting With A Clear History Of Coin Ingestion A Frontal Chest Radiograph  Including The Entire Esophagus Is Adequate To Guide Treatment. Methods: We  Reviewed The Clinical History And Radiographic Surveys Of 134 Patients Presenting  With Suspected Or Witnessed Coin Ingestion To The Emergency Department Of A  Tertiary Care Pediatric Hospital Between January 2012 And June 2016. Patient  Demographics, Presenting Symptoms, Anatomic Coverage Of Survey, Type, Number And  Location Of Radiopaque Foreign Bodies, Intervention, And Follow-Up Were Recorded.  Results: Coins Were Identified On Radiographic Surveys In 109 Of 134 Patients; 25  Of 134 Patients Had No Coin. Of Those With Coins, None Of 109 Had Coin(S) In The  Airway, 42 Of 109 Had Coin(S) In The Esophagus, And 67 Of 109 Had Coin(S) Distal  To The Esophagus. Of Those With Esophageal Coins, 35 Of 42 Reported Symptoms, 7  Of 42 Were Asymptomatic, 40 Of 42 Underwent Endoscopic Coin Removal, And 2 Of 42  Had No Intervention. Of 92 Of 134 Surveyed Patients With No Coin Or Coin Distal  To The Esophagus, 30 Of 92 Reported Symptoms, 62 Of 92 Were Asymptomatic, 90 Of  92 Had No Further Intervention, And 2 Of 92 Eventually Underwent Endoscopic Coin  Removal For Specific Indications (Abdominal Pain, Delayed Passage). When There  Was No Coin Found In The Esophagus, The Negative Predictive Value For  Intervention Was 97.8%. Conclusions: Following A Clear History Of Coin Ingestion,  A Frontal Chest Radiograph Including The Entire Length Of The Esophagus Provides  Sufficient Information To Direct Patient Management.",,,

Among The 25 Total Patients, 4 Ingested Foreign Bodies Intentionally, Whereas The Other 21 Cases Were Accidental. The Foreign Bodies Were Identified By Plain X-Ray Film In 2 Patients (2 Cases Of Needles) And By Multidetector Computed Tomography (Mdct) In 11 Patients (6 Cases Of Date Stones, 3 Cases Of Metallic Objects, And 2 Cases Of Bone Fragments), Thus Supporting The Correct Preoperative Diagnosis (13 Cases; 52%). The Most Common Location Of The Perforation Was The Terminal Ileum (N = 17). The Offending Objects Were Date Stones (N = 13), Bones (N = 7), And Metallic Objects (N = 5). The Most Common Treatment Was Removal Of The Foreign Body And Closure Of The Perforation With Simple Suture (N = 22). Ten Patients Were Treated Laparoscopically. The Present Study Shows That The Most Common Foreign Bodies Causing Intestinal Perforation Are Date Stones And Bones.

Its Origin Comes From Embryonic Cells Of The Notochord And It Is A Unipotent Tumor. Pyometra Is The Accumulation Of Purulent Content In The Uterine Lumen. Cystic Endometrial Hyperplasia Is One Of The Factors Predisposing A Dog To The Development Of Pyometra. The Safest And Most Efficient Treatment For Pyometra Is Ovariohysterectomy. The Purpose Of This Report Was To Describe A Case Of Ovarian Teratoma And Cystic Endometrial Hyperplasia With Concomitant Pyometra In A Labrador Retriever Bitch. Case: A 10-Year-Old Bitch Labrador Retriever, Weighing 42 Kg, Was Evaluated At Animal Care Barueri Veterinary Clinic, In Barueri, Sao Paulo. The Patient Was Referred From Another Veterinary Service To Our Clinic For An Ovariohysterectomy And Removal Of An Intestinal Foreign Body As Previous Ultrasonography (Us) Had Indicated The Presence Of Pyometra And A Foreign Body In The Descending Colon (She Had Ingested Cloth According To The Owner'S Report). Laboratory Tests, Complete Blood Count, Alanine Aminotransferase, Alkaline Phosphatase, Urea, And Creatinine Levels Did Not Show Any Significant Changes. Upon Examination, The Clinical Signs Were Mucopurulent Vaginal Discharge, 5% Dehydration, Rectal Temperature 39.1 Degrees C, Mild Abdominal Pain On Palpation, Normophagy, Normodipsia, And Normal Defecation And Urination. Laboratory Tests And A New Us Were Requested On Which The Uterus Was Observed With The Presence Of Luminal Anechoic Content And Increased Uterine Diameter (Uterine Horns 3.97 Cm), An Acoustic Intestinal Shadow Supposedly From A Foreign Body, And On The Leukogram, Leukocytosis (23,600/Mm3) Due To Neutrophilia With A Right Shift (20,532/Mm3) Was Observed. Therapeutic Ovariohysterectomy And Exploratory Celiotomy Were Chosen As Therapeutic Options. Celiotomy With Caudoumbilical Mid Ventral Access Was Performed. When The Left Uterine Horn Was Identified, An Attempt Was Made To Pull It In Order To Expose The Left Ovary, But This Maneuver Was Not Successful. For This Reason, The Abdominal Incision Was Enlarged Cranially. At That Point, A Huge Mass Was Observed In The Ovary (Which Was Supposedly The Acoustic Shadow Of The Foreign Body In The Descending Colon/Left Ovary). The Intestines Appeared Normal. Macroscopically, The Mass Had An Irregular Surface, Round Shape, Firm Consistency, And Was 15 Cm Long X 10 Cm Wide. Once Removed, The Mass Was Incised In The Transversal Direction, Purulent Content, Hair, And Mineralized Areas Inside It Were Observed. Histopathological Examination Showed Neoplastic Proliferation, Consisting Of Cells With Elongated Epithelioid Shape That Were Arranged In Long Irregular Bundles Among Well-Differentiated Adipose Tissue. An Exuberant Eosinophilic Matrix With Extensive Cystic Areas Filled With Lamellar Keratin And Hairy Stems Covered By Squamous Epithelium Was Also Observed. Extensive Areas Exhibiting Nervous Tissue With Minimal Atypia Are Shown. The Morphological Picture Was Compatible With Teratoma. Discussion: The Present Report Describes The Concomitant Presence Of Ovarian Teratoma And Pyometra In A Dog. The Diagnosis Of Pyometra Requires Complementary Tests (Laboratory And Imaging). The Intestinal Acoustic Shadow Observed On The Two Us Images Obtained By Two Different Professionals Was Suggestive Of Intestinal Foreign Body But Was Also A Wrong Diagnosis, Which Was Confirmed After An Exploratory Celiotomy When The Mass In The Left Ovary Was Identified. On The Histopathological Examination Of This Present Case, Epithelial, Nervous, And Cartilaginous Tissues Were Observed. This Differentiation Of Tissues Corroborated The Teratoma Diagnosis. Thus, The Importance Of An Accurate Diagnosis Contributes To The Resolution Of A Surgical Conditions That May Have Had A Poor Prognosis When The Procedure Took A Longer Time To Perform.",,,

The majority of foreign body ingestions occur in younger ages, with a peak incidence between the ages of 6 months and 6 years. Indications for removal depend upon a patient's age and size, the type and form of the swallowed item, its location as well as the clinical symptoms and time since ingestion. Esophageal impaction of a foreign body  whether it is blunt or sharp  requires more urgent intervention compared to more distally located foreign bodies. Food bolus impaction in children may indicate underlying esophageal pathology, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, peptic or other strictures, achalasia, and other motility disorders.

The use of two X-ray views will help localize the foreign body to the esophagus. Food boluses represent the most common type of foreign body in the esophagus. Patients having trouble with secretions due to foreign body ingestion should have an endoscopy within 24 hours. Button batteries constitute a special type of foreign bodies because they cause damage by three combined mechanisms. Due to their shape, these devices can lodge in the esophagus. Electrical current generated in the negative pole of the battery produces hydroxide, and the acid contents of the stomach can cause the battery to leak its contents, which are mainly alkaline electrolytes. The combination of those factors causes liquefaction necrosis, which in turn can lead to perforation and future scarring. Magnets are another type of foreign body that deserves special attention.",,

pecially; if the victim is a child. Infants and children are the most commonly seen victims, ingestion is often intentional, unlike
adults, who constitute a small proportion of victims and ingestion is often accidental. The number of foreign bodies found at
the emergency units of many hospitals is quite large. These include coins, safety pins, sewing needles, button batteries and nuts.
However, many of the foreign bodies are excreted safely without any untoward events, except for foreign bodies with sharp
ends, containing toxic chemicals and where there is a pre-existing anatomical abnormality in the gastro-Intestinal Tract (GIT).
Foreign bodies, especially those with sharp ends are prone to getting arrested, inflicting mucosal erosion or even perforating any
part of the GIT, particularly at the site of physiologic or anatomic constrictions. These areas are the three Oesophageal anatomic
narrowing, the pylorus, Ileo-Caecal valve and the recto-sigmoid junction. Most foreign bodies can be seen on plain radiograph,
removal, where indicated, can be done endoscopically or through an open surgery. But, majority can be managed expectantly,
aided by patience, careful serial radiographic monitoring and perhaps use of lubricating solutions like liquid paraffin.

Background: Foreign body (FB) in the aerodigestive tract presents more commonly in children and remains a surgical emergency with potential for fatal complications.

Objectives: To describe management and outcomes of aerodigestive FB managed at University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH) and proffer preventive measures.

Methods: A 9-year retrospective review of all patients with foreign body in the aerodigestive tract managed between March 2011 and July 2020.

Results: Sixty-six patients were studied. Median age was 9years with M:F ratio =1.6:1. FB was ingested in 38(57.6%) patients, aspiration occurred in 28(42.4%). Denture was most common FB 20(30.3%); plastic whistle/valve placed in dolls or football accounted for 4(6.1%). When ingested, FB was impacted in cervical 17(44.7%), upper thoracic 10(26.3%) and middle thoracic 2(5.3%) oesophagus. Oesophagoscopy was used in 30(8.9%) for retrieval. When aspirated, FB was located in the right bronchus 10(35.7%), left bronchus 7(25.0%), hypopharynx and trachea 2(7.1%) each, and cricopharynx 1(3.5%); no FB was found in 3(10.7%) patients. Direct Laryngoscopy was the method of retrieval in 3(10.1%) patients while others had rigid bronchoscopy. Mortality rate was 1.5%.

Conclusion: Children are most vulnerable group. Preventive effort should include public health education and close monitoring of children by parents and care givers during play.",,

Objectives Primary Objective To Assess The Effects Of Skin Care Interventions Such As Emollients For Primary Prevention Of Eczema And Food Allergy In Infants. Secondary Objective To Identify Features Of Study Populations Such As Age, Hereditary Risk, And Adherence To Interventions That Are Associated With The Greatest Treatment Benefit Or Harm For Both Eczema And Food Allergy. Search Methods We Performed An Updated Search Of The Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, Central, Medline, And Embase In September 2021. We Searched Two Trials Registers In July 2021. We Checked The Reference Lists Of Included Studies And Relevant Systematic Reviews, And Scanned Conference Proceedings To Identify Further References To Relevant Randomised Controlled Trials (Rcts).  Selection Criteria We Included Rcts Of Skin Care Interventions That Could Potentially Enhance Skin Barrier Function, Reduce Dryness, Or Reduce Subclinical Inflammation In Healthy Term (> 37 Weeks) Infants (≤ 12 Months) Without Pre‐Existing Eczema, Food Allergy, Or Other Skin Condition. Eligible Comparisons Were Standard Care In The Locality Or No Treatment. Types Of Skin Care Interventions Could Include Moisturisers/Emollients; Bathing Products; Advice Regarding Reducing Soap Exposure And Bathing Frequency; And Use Of Water Softeners. No Minimum Follow‐Up Was Required. Data Collection And Analysis This Is A Prospective Individual Participant Data (Ipd) Meta‐Analysis. We Used Standard Cochrane Methodological Procedures, And Primary Analyses Used The Ipd Dataset. Primary Outcomes Were Cumulative Incidence Of Eczema And Cumulative Incidence Of Immunoglobulin (Ig)E‐Mediated Food Allergy By One To Three Years, Both Measured At The Closest Available Time Point To Two Years. Secondary Outcomes Included Adverse Events During The Intervention Period; Eczema Severity (Clinician‐Assessed); Parent Report Of Eczema Severity; Time To Onset Of Eczema; Parent Report Of Immediate Food Allergy; And Allergic Sensitisation To Food Or Inhalant Allergen. Main Results We Identified 33 Rcts Comprising 25,827 Participants. Of These, 17 Studies Randomising 5823 Participants Reported Information On One Or More Outcomes Specified In This Review.  We Included 11 Studies, Randomising 5217 Participants, In One Or More Meta‐Analyses (Range 2 To 9 Studies Per Individual Meta‐Analysis), With 10 Of These Studies Providing Ipd; The Remaining 6 Studies Were Included In The Narrative Results Only.   Most Studies Were Conducted At Children'S Hospitals. Twenty‐Five Studies, Including All Those Contributing Data To Meta‐Analyses, Randomised Newborns Up To Age Three Weeks To Receive A Skin Care Intervention Or Standard Infant Skin Care. Eight Of The 11 Studies Contributing To Meta‐Analyses Recruited Infants At High Risk Of Developing Eczema Or Food Allergy, Although The Definition Of High Risk Varied Between Studies. Durations Of Intervention And Follow‐Up Ranged From 24 Hours To Three Years. All Interventions Were Compared Against No Skin Care Intervention Or Local Standard Care. Of The 17 Studies That Reported Information On Our Prespecified Outcomes, 13 Assessed Emollients. We Assessed Most Of The Evidence In The Review As Low Certainty And Had Some Concerns About Risk Of Bias. A Rating Of Some Concerns Was Most Often Due To Lack Of Blinding Of Outcome Assessors Or Significant Missing Data, Which Could Have Impacted Outcome Measurement But Was Judged Unlikely To Have Done So. We Assessed The Evidence For The Primary Food Allergy Outcome As High Risk Of Bias Due To The Inclusion Of Only One Trial, Where Findings Varied Based On Different Assumptions About Missing Data. Skin Care Interventions During Infancy Probably Do Not Change The Risk Of Eczema By One To Three Years Of Age (Risk Ratio (Rr) 1.03, 95% Confidence Interval (Ci) 0.81 To 1.31; Risk Difference 5 More Cases Per 1000 Infants, 95% Ci 28 Less To 47 More; Moderate‐Certainty Evidence; 3075 Participants, 7 Trials) Or Time To Onset Of Eczema (Hazard Ratio 0.86, 95% Ci 0.65 To 1.14; Moderate‐Certainty Evidence; 3349 Participants, 9 Trials). Skin Care Interventions During Infancy May Increase The Risk Of Ige‐Mediated Food Allergy By One To Three Years Of Age (Rr 2.53, 95% Ci 0.99 To 6.49; Low‐Certainty Evidence; 976 Participants, 1 Trial) But May Not Change Risk Of Allergic Sensitisation To A Food Allergen By Age One To Three Years (Rr 1.05, 95% Ci 0.64 To 1.71; Low‐Certainty Evidence; 1794 Participants, 3 Trials). Skin Care Interventions During Infancy May Slightly Increase Risk Of Parent Report Of Immediate Reaction To A Common Food Allergen At Two Years (Rr 1.27, 95% Ci 1.00 To 1.61; Low‐Certainty Evidence; 1171 Participants, 1 Trial); However, This Was Only Seen For Cow’S Milk, And May Be Unreliable Due To Over‐Reporting Of Milk Allergy In Infants. Skin Care Interventions During Infancy Probably Increase Risk Of Skin Infection Over The Intervention Period (Rr 1.33, 95% Ci 1.01 To 1.75; Risk Difference 17 More Cases Per 1000 Infants, 95% Ci One More To 38 More; Moderate‐Certainty Evidence; 2728 Participants, 6 Trials) And May Increase The Risk Of Infant Slippage Over The Intervention Period (Rr 1.42, 95% Ci 0.67 To 2.99; Low‐Certainty Evidence; 2538 Participants, 4 Trials) And Stinging/Allergic Reactions To Moisturisers (Rr 2.24, 95% 0.67 To 7.43; Low‐Certainty Evidence; 343 Participants, 4 Trials), Although Cis For Slippages And Stinging/Allergic Reactions Were Wide And Include The Possibility Of No Effect Or Reduced Risk. Preplanned Subgroup Analyses Showed That The Effects Of Interventions Were Not Influenced By Age, Duration Of Intervention, Hereditary Risk, Filaggrin ( Flg ) Mutation, Chromosome 11 Intergenic Variant Rs2212434,   Or Classification Of Intervention Type For Risk Of Developing Eczema. We Could Not Evaluate These Effects On Risk Of Food Allergy. Evidence Was Insufficient To Show Whether Adherence To Interventions Influenced The Relationship Between Skin Care Interventions And Eczema Or Food Allergy Development. Authors' Conclusions Based On Low‐ To Moderate‐Certainty Evidence, Skin Care Interventions Such As Emollients During The First Year Of Life In Healthy Infants Are Probably Not Effective For Preventing Eczema; May Increase Risk Of Food Allergy; And Probably Increase Risk Of Skin Infection. Further Study Is Needed To Understand Whether Different Approaches To Infant Skin Care Might Prevent Eczema Or Food Allergy. Plain Language Summary Skin Care Interventions For Preventing Eczema And Food Allergy Does Moisturising Baby Skin Prevent Eczema Or Food Allergies? Key Messages Skin Care Treatments In Babies, Such As Using Moisturisers On The Skin During The First Year Of Life, Probably Do Not Prevent Babies From Developing Eczema; May Increase The Chance Of Food Allergy; And Probably Increase The Chance Of Skin Infection. This Review Looked At The Prevention Of Eczema And Food Allergy Only. Skin Care Treatments Are Still Important To Treat Eczema.  What Are Allergies? An Immune Response Is How The Body Recognises And Defends Itself Against Substances That Appear Harmful. An Allergy Is A Reaction Of The Body'S Immune System To A Particular Food Or Substance (An Allergen) That Is Usually Harmless. Different Allergies Affect Different Parts Of The Body, And Their Effects Can Be Mild Or Serious. Food Allergies And Eczema Eczema Is A Common Skin Condition  That Causes Dry, Itchy, Cracked Skin. Eczema Is Common In Children, Often Developing Before Their First Birthday, And May Be Long‐Lasting. Allergies To Food Can Cause Itching In The Mouth, A Raised Itchy Red Rash, Swelling Of The Face, Stomach Symptoms, Or Difficulty Breathing. They Usually Happen Within Two Hours After A Food Is Eaten. People With Food Allergies Often Have Other Allergic Conditions, Such As Asthma, Hay Fever, And Eczema. Why We Did This Cochrane Review We Wanted To Learn How Skin Care Affects The Risk Of A Baby Developing Eczema Or Food Allergies. Skin Care Treatments Included: • Putting Moisturisers On A Baby'S Skin; • Bathing Babies With Water Containing Moisturisers Or Moisturising Oils; • Advising Parents To Use Less Soap, Or To Bathe Their Child Less Often; • Using Water Softeners.  We Also Wanted To Know If These Skin Care Treatments Cause Any Unwanted Effects.  What Did We Do? We Searched For Studies Of Different Types Of Skin Care For Healthy Babies (Aged Up To One Year) With No Previous Food Allergy, Eczema, Or Other Skin Condition. Search Date:  We Incorporated Evidence Published Up To July 2021. We Were Interested In Studies That Reported: • How Many Children Developed Eczema, Or Food Allergy, By Age One To Three Years; • How Severe The Eczema Was (According To A Researcher And To Parents); • How Long It Took For Eczema To Develop; • Parents' Reports Of Immediate (Under Two Hours) Reactions To A Food Allergen; • How Many Children Developed Sensitivity To A Particular Food Allergen; • Any Unwanted Effects. We Assessed The Strengths And Weaknesses Of Each Study To Determine How Reliable The Results Might Be, And Then Combined The Results Of The Relevant Studies And Looked At Overall Effects.   What We Found We Found 33 Studies, Involving 25,827 Babies, That Assessed Any Type Of Skin Intervention. The Included Studies Took Place In Europe, Australia, Japan, And The Usa, Most Often At Children'S Hospitals. Skin Care Was Compared Against No Skin Care Or Usual Skin Care For Babies In That Country. Treatment And Follow‐Up Times Ranged From 24 Hours To Three Years. Many Studies (13) Tested The Use Of Moisturisers; The Other Studies Mainly Tested The Use Of Bathing And Cleansing Products And How Often They Were Used. Of The 33 Included Studies, Only 11 Studies Had Comparable Outcomes Of Eczema, Food Allergy, Or Adverse Effects And Were Combined For Analysis. All Of These Studies Enrolled Babies Before They Were One Month Old, And  Eight Of These Studies Included Babies Thought To Be At High Risk For Developing Eczema.  What Are The Main Results Of Our Review? Compared To No Skin Care Or Standard Care, Moisturisers: • Probably Do Not Change The Chance Of Developing Eczema By Age One To Three Years (7 Studies; 3075 Babies), Or The Time Needed For Eczema To Develop (9 Studies; 3349 Babies); • May Increase The Chance Of Developing A Food Allergy As Judged By A Researcher (1 Study; 976 Babies) By Age One To Three Years; • May Slightly Increase The Number Of Immediate Reactions To A Common Food Allergen At Two Years, As Reported By Parents (1 Study; 1171 Babies); • Probably Cause More Skin Infections (6 Studies; 2728 Babies); • May Increase Unwanted Effects, Such As A Stinging Feeling Or An Allergic Reaction To Moisturisers (4 Studies; 343 Babies); • May Increase The Chance Of Babies Slipping (4 Studies; 2538 Babies); • May Not Affect The Chance Of Developing Sensitivity To Food Allergens (3 Studies; 1797 Babies) By Age One To Three Years. Confidence In Our Results We Are Moderately Confident In Our Results For Developing Eczema And The Time Needed To Develop Eczema. We Are Less Confident About Our Results For Food Allergy Or Sensitivity, Which Are Based On Small Numbers Of Studies With Widely Varying Results. These Results Are Likely To Change When More Evidence Becomes Available. Our Confidence In The Review Findings For Skin Infections Is Moderate, But Low For Stinging Or Allergic Reactions And Slipping. ",,,

We Present One Of The Lowest Presenting Blood Glucose Levels For The Edka  In The Setting Of Sglt2 Inhibitor Use. A 34-Year-Old Female With A Two-Year  History Of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2Dm) Presented After Accidental Ingestion  Of A Metal Clip And Lack Of Oral Intake For 28 Hours. She Reported A Recent  Intentional Weight Loss Of 60 Lbs. She Takes Metformin 1000 Mg Twice Daily And  Empagliflozin 25 Mg Daily. An Urgent Endoscopy Was Planned In The Intensive Care  Unit Given The Proximal Location Of The Foreign Body. The Basic Metabolic Profile  After The Procedure Demonstrated A Glucose Level Of 75 Mg/Dl, Bicarbonate Level  Of 11 Mmol/L, And Ag Of 17 Mmol/L. The Venous Ph Was 7.27 With A Partial Pressure  Of Carbon Dioxide Of 30 Mmhg. The Urinalysis Showed A Glucose Level Greater Than  500 Μmol/L With A Ketone Level Of 80 Μmol/L. The Blood And Urine Toxicology  Screening Results Were Unremarkable. The Patient Was Treated For Edka With The  Administration Of Intravenous (Iv) Dextrose 5% In Water With Subsequent  Initiation Of Iv Insulin. The Assessment Of Her Insulin Reserve Revealed A Low  C-Peptide Of 0.36 Ng/Ml, A High Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase Level Greater Than  250 Iu/Ml, And High Zinc Transporter 8 (Znt8) Antibodies Of 42 U/Ml, Consistent  With An Undiagnosed Transition To Latent Autoimmune Diabetes In Adults (Lada).  The Blood Glucose Levels For Previously Reported Cases Remain Between 90 And 250  Mg/Dl. In This Case, The Combination Of A Low Carbohydrate Diet And Prolonged  Starvation May Have Led To The Impressively Low Glucose. Additionally, The Sglt2  Inhibitor Use In Patients With Lada Serves As One Of The Known Risk Factors For  Edka. Edka Poses A Diagnostic Challenge, Especially In The Icu Setting Where  There Exists A Myriad Of Causes For High Ag Metabolic Acidosis. Additionally,  Many Of The Icu Patients Are In A Ketotic State Brought On By Prolonged  Starvation. Therefore, Prompt Diagnosis And Treatment For Edka Require Careful  History Taking And Complete Investigation For Other Causes Of High Ag Metabolic  Acidosis.",,,

Case Presentation: We Discuss A Case  Of A 43-Year-Old Male Presented To Our Emergency Department After Accidently  Swallowing A Metallic Screw, 1 H And A Half Prior To His Presentation. He Was  Initially Asymptomatic Then Started To Complain Of Vague Abdominal Symptoms.  X-Rays Of The Chest And Abdomen Demonstrated The Presence Of A Metallic Screw At  The Mid-Abdomen.

A Pubmed And Google Scholar Search  Discovered A Variety Of Case Reports Detailing Various Methods And Indications  For Endoscopic Retrieval Of Right Sided Colonic Foreign Bodies. This Case Report  Endeavors To Supplement The Literature So That Guidelines Can One Day Be  Established For Colonoscopic Retrieval Of Right-Sided Foreign Bodies. Case  Presentation: 36-Year-Old Male Prisoner Swallowed 6.5 Cm Nail Clippers With A  Long-Standing History Of Intentional Foreign Body Ingestion (Fbi) Including  Multiple Laparotomies For Foreign Body Retrievals.

It Is Associated With Severe Pain Developing 2 To 3 Days Postoperatively With Or Without Halitosis, A Socket That May Be Partially Or Totally Devoid Of A Blood Clot, And Increased Postoperative Visits. This Is An Update Of The Cochrane Review First Published In 2012.  Objectives To Assess The Effects Of Local Interventions Used For The Prevention And Treatment Of Alveolar Osteitis (Dry Socket) Following Tooth Extraction. Search Methods An Information Specialist Searched Four Bibliographic Databases Up To 28 September 2021 And Used Additional Search Methods To Identify Published, Unpublished, And Ongoing Studies. Selection Criteria We Included Randomised Controlled Trials Of Adults Over 18 Years Of Age Who Were Having Permanent Teeth Extracted Or Who Had Developed Dry Socket Postextraction. We Included Studies With Any Type Of Local Intervention Used For The Prevention Or Treatment Of Dry Socket, Compared To A Different Local Intervention, Placebo Or No Treatment. We Excluded Studies Reporting On Systemic Use Of Antibiotics Or The Use Of Surgical Techniques Because These Interventions Are Evaluated In Separate Cochrane Reviews. Data Collection And Analysis We Used Standard Methodological Procedures Expected By Cochrane. We Followed Cochrane Statistical Guidelines And Reported Dichotomous Outcomes As Risk Ratios (Rr) And Calculated 95% Confidence Intervals (Ci) Using Random‐Effects Models. For Some Of The Split‐Mouth Studies With Sparse Data, It Was Not Possible To Calculate Rr So We Calculated The Exact Odds Ratio (Or) Instead. We Used Grade To Assess The Certainty Of The Body Of Evidence. Main Results We Included 49 Trials With 6771 Participants; 39 Trials (With 6219 Participants) Investigated Prevention Of Dry Socket And 10 Studies (With 552 Participants) Looked At The Treatment Of Dry Socket. 16 Studies Were At High Risk Of Bias, 30 Studies At Unclear Risk Of Bias, And 3 Studies At Low Risk Of Bias. Chlorhexidine In The Prevention Of Dry Socket When Compared To Placebo, Rinsing With Chlorhexidine Mouthrinses (0.12% And 0.2% Concentrations) Both Before And 24 Hours After Extraction(S) Substantially Reduced The Risk Of Developing Dry Socket With An Or Of 0.38 (95% Ci 0.25 To 0.58; P < 0.00001; 6 Trials, 1547 Participants; Moderate‐Certainty Evidence). The Prevalence Of Dry Socket Varies From 1% To 5% In Routine Dental Extractions To Upwards Of 30% In Surgically Extracted Third Molars. The Number Of Patients Needed To Be Treated (Nnt) With Chlorhexidine Rinse To Prevent One Patient Having Dry Socket Was 162 (95% Ci 155 To 240), 33 (95% Ci 27 To 49), And 7 (95% Ci 5 To 10) For Control Prevalence Of Dry Socket 0.01, 0.05, And 0.30 Respectively.  Compared To Placebo, Placing Chlorhexidine Gel Intrasocket After Extractions Reduced The Odds Of Developing A Dry Socket By 58% With An Or Of 0.44 (95% Ci 0.27 To 0.71; P = 0.0008; 7 Trials, 753 Participants; Moderate‐Certainty Evidence). The Nnt With Chlorhexidine Gel (0.2%) To Prevent One Patient Developing Dry Socket Was 180 (95% Ci 137 To 347), 37 (95% Ci 28 To 72), And 7 (95% Ci 5 To 15) For Control Prevalence Of Dry Socket Of 0.01, 0.05, And 0.30 Respectively. Compared To Chlorhexidine Rinse (0.12%), Placing Chlorhexidine Gel (0.2%) Intrasocket After Extractions Was Not Superior In Reducing The Risk Of Dry Socket (Rr 0.74, 95% Ci 0.46 To 1.20; P = 0.22; 2 Trials, 383 Participants; Low‐Certainty Evidence).  The Present Review Found Some Evidence For The Association Of Minor Adverse Reactions With Use Of 0.12%, 0.2% Chlorhexidine Mouthrinses (Alteration In Taste, Staining Of Teeth, Stomatitis) Though Most Studies Were Not Designed Explicitly To Detect The Presence Of Hypersensitivity Reactions To Mouthwash As Part Of The Study Protocol. No Adverse Events Were Reported In Relation To The Use Of 0.2% Chlorhexidine Gel Placed Directly Into A Socket. Platelet Rich Plasma In The Prevention Of Dry Socket  Compared To Placebo, Placing Platelet Rich Plasma After Extractions Was Not Superior In Reducing The Risk Of Having A Dry Socket (Rr 0.51, 95% Ci 0.19 To 1.33; P = 0.17; 2 Studies, 127 Participants; Very Low‐Certainty Evidence).  A Further 21 Intrasocket Interventions To Prevent Dry Socket Were Each Evaluated In Single Studies, And There Is Insufficient Evidence To Determine Their Effects. Zinc Oxide Eugenol Versus Alvogyl In The Treatment Of Dry Socket Two Studies, With 80 Participants, Showed That Alvogyl (Old Formulation) Is More Effective Than Zinc Oxide Eugenol At Reducing Pain At Day 7 (Mean Difference (Md) ‐1.40, 95% Ci ‐1.75 To ‐1.04; P < 0.00001; 2 Studies, 80 Participants; Very Low‐Certainty Evidence) A Further Nine Interventions For The Treatment Of Dry Socket Were Evaluated In Single Studies, Providing Insufficient Evidence To Determine Their Effects. Authors' Conclusions Tooth Extractions Are Generally Undertaken By Dentists For A Variety Of Reasons, However, All But Five Studies Included In The Present Review Included Participants Undergoing Extraction Of Third Molars, Most Of Which Were Undertaken By Oral Surgeons. There Is Moderate‐Certainty Evidence That Rinsing With Chlorhexidine (0.12% And 0.2%) Or Placing Chlorhexidine Gel (0.2%) In The Sockets Of Extracted Teeth, Probably Results In A Reduction In Dry Socket. There Was Insufficient Evidence To Determine The Effects Of The Other 21 Preventative Interventions Each Evaluated In Single Studies. There Was Limited Evidence Of Very Low Certainty That Alvogyl (Old Formulation) May Reduce Pain At Day 7 In Patients With Dry Socket When Compared To Zinc Oxide Eugenol.  Plain Language Summary What Treatments Can Be Used To Prevent And Treat Alveolar Osteitis (Dry Socket)?  Key Messages ‐ Rinsing With Chlorhexidine Mouthwash Before A Dental Extraction Or Beginning 24 Hours After May Help To Prevent A Dry Socket.‐ Placing A Chlorhexidine Gel Directly Into The Socket Immediately After Tooth Extraction May Help To Prevent A Dry Socket.‐ Chlorhexidine Rinses Cause Some Minor Adverse (Unwanted) Effects; Chlorhexidine Intrasocket Gels Do Not Appear To Cause Adverse Effects.‐ Alvogyl Reduces The Pain Of A Dry Socket When Compared To Zinc Oxide Eugenol, But The Evidence For This Is Very Uncertain.‐ Alvogyl Does Not Appear To Cause Unwanted Effects.‐ We Need Future Studies To Strengthen The Evidence And Investigate The Best Ways To Prevent And Treat Dry Socket In All Teeth. What Is Dry Socket? Dry Socket Is A Painful Condition That Sometimes Arises After A Tooth Has Been Extracted And Is More Likely To Occur Following Extraction Of Wisdom Teeth In The Lower Jaw. What Causes Dry Socket? It Is Thought To Be Linked To The Loss Of Some Or All Of The Blood Clot That Forms At The Bottom Of A Tooth Socket After A Tooth Is Taken Out. How Can We Prevent Dry Socket? An Option For Prevention Of Dry Socket Is To Reduce Debris And The Bacterial Load In The Mouth, Though Dry Socket Is Not Bacterial In Origin. People With Poor Oral Hygiene (Food Debris And Plaque) Are At Greater Risk Of Dry Socket. Improved Oral Hygiene And Rinsing Before A Dental Extraction Or Beginning 24 Hours After May Reduce The Likelihood Of Dry Socket. How Can We Treat Dry Socket ? Options For Treating Dry Socket Largely Focus On Reducing Pain Locally Around The Tooth Extraction Site By Placing An Obtundent (A Soothing Medicated Dressing). What Did We Want To Find Out ? We Wanted To Find Out If Antiseptic Rinses, Gels, Or Healing Patches Could Help To Prevent Dry Socket. We Also Wanted To Find Out If Placing A Medicated Dressing Could Treat A Dry Socket And Whether Any Unwanted Side Effects Were Produced. What Did We Do? We Searched For Studies That Compared Antiseptic Rinses Or Intrasocket Gels With A Placebo (Dummy) Rinse Or Nothing And A Placebo (Dummy) Intrasocket Gel Or Nothing. To Find The Best Way To Treat Dry Socket We Searched For Studies That Compared Different Soothing Agents With A Placebo (Dummy) With Other Soothing Agents Or With Nothing. We Compared The Results Of The Studies And Summarised The Findings. We Made An Assessment Of Our Confidence In The Evidence Based On The Design Of The Study And The Number Of Patients Recruited. What Did We Find? We Identified 49 Trials; 39 Trials (6219 Participants) Investigated Prevention Of Dry Socket And 10 Trials (552 Participants) Investigated The Treatment Of Dry Socket. We Found That: ‐ Rinsing Both Before And After Tooth Extraction (Commencing 24 Hours After Extraction) With Chlorhexidine Gluconate Rinse (At 0.12% And 0.2% Strength) Probably Results In A Reduction In Dry Socket;‐ Placing Chlorhexidine Gel (0.2% Strength) In The Socket Of An Extracted Tooth Probably Results In A Reduction In Dry Socket;‐ Chlorhexidine Rinses And Gels Are Equally Effective At Reducing Dry Socket, But The Evidence For This Comparison Is Very Uncertain;‐ Chlorhexidine Rinses Produced Some Minor Unwanted Effects; Chlorhexidine Intrasocket Gels Appeared To Produce No Unwanted Effects;‐ There Was A Small Amount Of Evidence Of Very Low Certainty From Two Studies That Alvogyl (Old Formulation) May Reduce Pain At Day 7 In Patients With Dry Socket When Compared To Zinc Oxide Eugenol. This Evidence Relates To The Old Formulation Of Alvogyl Which Is No Longer Available. It Should Be Noted That The Formulation Of Alvogyl Has Changed, It Is Now Called Alveogyl.  Tooth Extractions Are Generally Undertaken By Dentists For A Variety Of Reasons, However, All But Five Studies Included In The Present Review Included Participants Undergoing Extraction Of Third Molars, Most Of Which Were Undertaken By Oral Surgeons.  What Are The Limitations Of The Evidence? The Main Limitation Of The Evidence Are That Studies: ‐ Reported Mostly On Tooth Extractions Involving Lower Wisdom Teeth;‐ Were Undertaken In Ways That Introduced Errors In The Conduct Of The Study Leading To Errors In The Results; And‐ Produced Imprecise Results When They Were Combined. Due To These Errors We Have Some Confidence In The Results Relating To Chlorhexidine Rinses And Gels But Further Research Is Likely To Have An Important Impact On Our Confidence In The Estimate Of Effect And May Change The Estimate. How Up To Date Is This Evidence? The Search For Existing Studies Was Completed By 28 September 2021.",,,

Food must be appropriately taken, ingested, and moved through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract: the stomach must secrete digestive enzymes, and the homeostatic function of the stomach must be maintained. Patients with oral disease may present with ptyalism, abnormal food prehension, dysphagia, inappetence, weight loss, and halitosis. Attempts to ingest food can cause trauma to the oropharyngeal mucosa, resulting in oral pain and bleeding. Esophageal diseases in dogs and cats are related to obstructive, motility, or inflammatory disorders. The esophagus connects the pharynx to the stomach and is responsible to transport ingesta and fluid. A Small intestinal surgery is most often indicated for GI obstruction. Recognizing peritonitis secondary to GI perforation caused by necrosis or ulceration is critical and must be treated promptly and aggressively.",,

Mostly Fbs Are Found Ingested Accidently Or Intentionally In Children And Adults With Mental  Status Alterations. Depending On The Type Of Object, Different Complications Can  Occur. There Exist Numerous Methods For Removing Each Specific Fb. Fortunately,  Most Fbs Tend To Move Uneventfully Through The Gastrointestinal Tract Without Any  Intervention; But Managing Some Foreign Objects Can Be Difficult And Lead To  Severe Complications. Endoscopy Helps With The Diagnosis And Treatment Of These  Cases, But The Time Of The Management Plays An Important Role. Case Presentation:  A 26-Year-Old Female Who Intentionally Swallowed Two Sewing Needles, Presented To  Our Emergency Department With Abdominal Pain Two Months After The Fb Ingestion.  One Of The Sewing Needles Was Spontaneously Excreted Through The Bowel, And The  Other Was Present In Her Body For Two Months.

Materials And Methods: Our Retrospective And Descriptive Study Focused' On 13 Inmates Having Ingested' 47 Foreign Bodies And Who Consulted The Emergency Of Our Department Over A 5-Year Period From January 2018 To July 2023. Results: The Study Population Consisted Of 12 Men And One Woman With An Average Age Of 32 Years (24 Years-47 Years). Foreign Bodies Ingested By Inmates Were Dominated By Batteries (59.52%) Followed By Lighters (19.04%). The Majoritý Of Foreign Bodies Were, At The Time Of Discovery, Located Mainly In The Stomach (6 Cases) And Colon (4 Cases). Ingestion Resulted In Epigastric Pain (3 Cases), Externalized Gastrointestinal Bleeding With Epigastralgia (2 Cases), And No Symptoms (8 Cases). Of The 13 Cases Of Foreign Body Ingestion, 6 Patients Underwent Endoscopic Extraction In The Gastroenterology Department. Extraction Was By Diathermic Loop, Dormia Loop And Endoscopic Basket.

Choking (Often Also Called  Suffocation) Can Be Caused By Food Or Inedible Objects And Leads To Various  Degrees Of Asphyxiation Or Lack Of Oxygen In The Blood Stream. The Incidence Is  Very High In Both Young Children And Adults, Especially Seniors. However, Since  Not All Choking Episodes End Up In The Emergency Room Or Become Fatalities, They  Often Escape Statistics. Although Episodes Of Choking From Non-Edible Bodies Are  Infrequent, They Affect Mostly Young Children. Three Of The Most Common Risks For  Choking In General Are Neurological Disorders, Dysphagia And Dental Issues (Few  Or No Teeth, Unstable Or Unsuitable Prosthesis Or Orthodontic Appliances).  The  Purpose Of This Study Was To Evaluate The Risk Factors Of Choking And Ways To  Reduce/Avoid This Event. We Reported Data On A Series Of 138 Patients Admitted To  The Emergency Department Following A Choking Event, At A Hospital In Rome, Italy.  The Age Group Of The Analyzed Population Ranged From 1 To 88 Years, With The Most  Represented Age Group Of These Between 40 And 59, With A Similar Distribution  Between Males And Females. The Types Of Foods On Which People Choked Reflected  The Seasonal, Traditional And Local Foods: 67% Of Patients Reported Choking On  Fish Bones Followed By Meat Bones (9%)  And Artichokes (3%). Three Relevant  Non-Food Choking Elements Reported Were: Orthodontic Items, Toothpicks And Pins  (One Occurrence Each). We Also Reported On Two Clinical Cases Of Patients Choking  On Meat And A Chicken Bone. In Conclusion, Choking Awareness And Prevention Are  Essential For Implementing Potential Life-Saving Precautions. Prevention Is The  First Tool To Reduce The Occurrence Of This Event, Therefore It Is Necessary To  Analyze The Risk Factors And Educate The Population To Eliminate Them. Proper  Chewing And Oral Manipulation Are Paramount Functions In Preventing Choking,  Along With Meal-Time Supervision If Little Children And Elderly. Then, It  Behooves The Healthcare Professionals To Disseminate Knowledge.",,,

Summary: Hyperphosphatemia Affects Most Patients With  End-Stage Renal Disease (Esrd) And Is Associated With Morbidity And Mortality.  Lanthanum Carbonate Reduces Daily Phosphate Absorption And Is Indicated As A  Non-Calcium-Based Phosphate Binder In Patients With Esrd. A 58-Year-Old Man With  A Medical History Of Stage 5 Chronic Kidney Disease Was Admitted To The Intensive  Care Unit (Icu) For Hyperkalemia And Acute Respiratory Failure After A Missed  Dialysis Session. He Required Vasopressors, Intubation, And Continuous Renal  Replacement Therapy. Admission Imaging Demonstrated Several Ingested Metallic  Foreign Bodies Within The Colon. There Was Consideration Of Colorectal Surgery  And Gastroenterology Consultation. On The Initial Medication Reconciliation, No  Medications That Would Have The Radiographic Appearance Of Ingested Metallic  Foreign Bodies Were Identified. On Further Review Of Prescription Data Available  Through The Electronic Medical Record, It Was Noted That The Patient Had Recently  Filled A Prescription For Lanthanum Despite Its Apparent Discontinuation On A  Previous Admission.

On 1 Implant Per Screwdriver, 26 Abutments Were Properly Attached One After The Other With The Corresponding Abutment Screws. After Tightening The Abutment Screw, The Force Required To Pull The Screwdriver Off The Screw Head Was Determined With A Spring Balance. For Both Manufacturers, Greater Pull-Off Forces Were Measured When Using The Original Screwdrivers Than When Using The Universal Screwdriver. The Pull-Off Force (Mean +/- Sd) Required For The Straumann Original Screwdriver Was 3.7 +/- 1.4 N, While That Required For The Universal Screwdriver Was 0.1 +/- 0.1 N (P < .001). The Pull-Off Force Was 1.5 +/- 1.5 N For The Bego Original Screwdriver And 0.7 +/- 0.9 N For The Universal Screwdriver (P = .19).

As A Clinicopathologic Disorder, A Diagnosis Of Eoe Requires A Constellation Of Clinical Symptoms Of Esophageal Dysfunction And Histologic Findings (At Least 15 Eosinophils/High‐Powered Microscope Field (Eos/Hpf)). Current Guidelines No Longer Require The Failure Of Response To Proton Pump Inhibitor Medications To Establish A Diagnosis Of Eoe, But Continue To Suggest The Exclusion Of Other Etiologies Of Esophageal Eosinophilia. The Treatment Goals For Eoe Are Improvement In Clinical Symptoms, Resolution Of Esophageal Eosinophilia And Other Histologic Abnormalities, Endoscopic Improvement, Improved Quality Of Life, Improved Esophageal Function, Minimized Adverse Effects Of Treatment, And Prevention Of Disease Progression And Subsequent Complications. Currently, There Is No Cure For Eoe, Making Long‐Term Treatment Necessary. Standard Treatment Modalities Include Dietary Modifications, Esophageal Dilation, And Pharmacologic Therapy. Effective Pharmacologic Therapies Include Corticosteroids, Rapidly Emerging Biological Therapies, And Proton Pump Inhibitor Medications. Objectives To Evaluate The Efficacy And Safety Of Medical Interventions For People With Eosinophilic Esophagitis. Search Methods We Searched Central, Medline, Embase, Clinicaltrials.Gov, And Who Ictrp To 3 March 2023. Selection Criteria Randomized Controlled Trials (Rcts) Comparing Any Medical Intervention Or Food Elimination Diet For The Treatment Of Eosinophilic Esophagitis, Either Alone Or In Combination, To Any Other Intervention (Including Placebo). Data Collection And Analysis Pairs Of Review Authors Independently Selected Studies And Conducted Data Extraction And Risk Of Bias Assessment. We Expressed Outcomes As A Risk Ratio (Rr) And As The Mean Or Standardized Mean Difference (Md/Smd) With 95% Confidence Interval (Ci). We Assessed The Certainty Of The Evidence Using Grade. Our Primary Outcomes Were: Clinical, Histological, And Endoscopic Improvement, And Withdrawals Due To Adverse Events. Secondary Outcomes Were: Serious And Total Adverse Events, And Quality Of Life. Main Results We Included 41 Rcts With 3253 Participants. Eleven Studies Included Pediatric Patients While The Rest Recruited Both Children And Adults. Four Studies Were In Patients With Inactive Disease While The Rest Were In Patients With Active Disease. We Identified 19 Intervention Comparisons. In This Abstract We Present The Results Of The Primary Outcomes For The Two Main Comparisons: Corticosteroids Versus Placebo And Biologics Versus Placebo, Based On The Prespecified Outcomes Defined Of The Primary Studies. Fourteen Studies Compared Corticosteroids To Placebo For Induction Of Remission And The Risk Of Bias For These Studies Was Mostly Low. Corticosteroids May Lead To Slightly Better Clinical Improvement (20% Higher), Measured Dichotomously (Risk Ratio (Rr) 1.74, 95% Ci 1.08 To 2.80; 6 Studies, 583 Participants; Number Needed To Treat For An Additional Beneficial Outcome (Nntb) = 4; Low Certainty), And May Lead To Slightly Better Clinical Improvement, Measured Continuously (Standard Mean Difference (Smd) 0.51, 95% Ci 0.17 To 0.85; 5 Studies, 475 Participants; Low Certainty). Corticosteroids Lead To A Large Histological Improvement (63% Higher), Measured Dichotomously (Rr 11.94, 95% Ci 6.56 To 21.75; 12 Studies, 978 Participants; Nntb = 3; High Certainty), And May Lead To Histological Improvement, Measured Continuously (Smd 1.42, 95% Ci 1.02 To 1.82; 5 Studies, 449 Participants; Low Certainty). Corticosteroids May Lead To Little To No Endoscopic Improvement, Measured Dichotomously (Rr 2.60, 95% Ci 0.82 To 8.19; 5 Studies, 596 Participants; Low Certainty), And May Lead To Endoscopic Improvement, Measured Continuously (Smd 1.33, 95% Ci 0.59 To 2.08; 5 Studies, 596 Participants; Low Certainty). Corticosteroids May Lead To Slightly Fewer Withdrawals Due To Adverse Events (Rr 0.64, 95% Ci 0.43 To 0.96; 14 Studies, 1032 Participants; Low Certainty). Nine Studies Compared Biologics To Placebo For Induction Of Remission. Biologics May Result In Little To No Difference In Clinical Improvement, Measured Dichotomously (Rr 1.14, 95% Ci 0.85 To 1.52; 5 Studies, 410 Participants; Low Certainty), And May Result In Better Clinical Improvement, Measured Continuously (Smd 0.50, 95% Ci 0.22 To 0.78; 7 Studies, 387 Participants; Moderate Certainty). Biologics Result In Better Histological Improvement (55% Higher), Measured Dichotomously (Rr 6.73, 95% Ci 2.58 To 17.52; 8 Studies, 925 Participants; Nntb = 2; Moderate Certainty). We Could Not Draw Conclusions For This Outcome When Measured Continuously (Smd 1.01, 95% Ci 0.36 To 1.66; 6 Studies, 370 Participants; Very Low Certainty). Biologics May Result In Little To No Difference In Endoscopic Improvement, Measured Dichotomously (Effect Not Estimable, Low Certainty). We Cannot Draw Conclusions For This Outcome When Measured Continuously (Smd 2.79, 95% Ci 0.36 To 5.22; 1 Study, 11 Participants; Very Low Certainty). There May Be No Difference In Withdrawals Due To Adverse Events (Rr 1.55, 95% Ci 0.88 To 2.74; 8 Studies, 792 Participants; Low Certainty). Authors' Conclusions Corticosteroids (As Compared To Placebo) May Lead To Clinical Symptom Improvement When Reported Both As Dichotomous And Continuous Outcomes, From The Primary Study Definitions. Corticosteroids Lead To A Large Increase In Histological Improvement (Dichotomous Outcome) And May Increase Histological Improvement (Continuous Outcome) When Compared To Placebo. Corticosteroids May Or May Not Increase Endoscopic Improvement (Depending On Whether The Outcome Is Measured Dichotomously Or Continuously). Withdrawals Due To Adverse Events (Dichotomous Outcome) May Occur Less Frequently When Corticosteroids Are Compared To Placebo. Biologics (As Compared To Placebo) May Not Lead To Clinical Symptom Improvement When Reported As A Dichotomous Outcome And May Lead To An Increase In Clinical Symptom Improvement (As A Continuous Outcome), From The Primary Study Definitions. Biologics Lead To A Large Increase In Histological Improvement When Reported As A Dichotomous Outcome, But This Is Uncertain When Reported As A Continuous Outcome, As Compared To Placebo. Biologics May Not Increase Endoscopic Improvement (Dichotomous Outcome), But This Is Uncertain When Measured As A Continuous Outcome. Withdrawals Due To Adverse Events As A Dichotomous Outcome May Occur As Frequently When Biologics Are Compared To Placebo. Plain Language Summary Medical Treatments For Eosinophilic Esophagitis Key Messages We Found That While Corticosteroids May Improve Patients' Symptoms, They Certainly Reduce The Amount Of Allergic Cells (Eosinophils) And They May Improve What The Disease Looks Like Under Visual Inspection (Endoscopy), When Compared To Placebo, For Children And Adults With Eosinophilic Esophagitis. They May Be Just As Safe As A Placebo (Dummy Treatment). We Found That Biologics (A Type Of Treatment That Uses Substances Made From Living Organisms To Treat Disease) May Improve Patients' Symptoms, That They Certainly Reduce The Amount Of Allergic Cells, And That They May Be No Different In Terms Of What The Disease Looks Like Under Visual Inspection, When Compared To Placebo, For Children And Adults With Eosinophilic Esophagitis. They May Be Just As Safe As A Placebo. What Is Eosinophilic Esophagitis? Eosinophilic Esophagitis Is A Long‐Term Allergic Condition In Which The Esophagus Becomes Inflamed (Sore), Which Can Lead To Difficulty Swallowing, Vomiting, Heartburn, And Chest And Stomach Pain. Particles In Foods Or The Air Cause The Immune System To Have An Allergic Reaction And Produce Immune Cells, Which Are Called Eosinophils. These Build Up In The Esophagus, The Tube That Connects The Mouth With The Stomach. Eosinophilic Esophagitis Was First Identified In The 1990S And Since Then It Has Been Recognized As A Major Digestive Illness. It Is Not Known What Causes It, But It Might Be Related To Genetics Combined With Environmental Triggers. People With Eosinophilic Esophagitis Tend To Have Other Allergies As Well. Currently, There Is No Cure For Eosinophilic Esophagitis, Making Long‐Term Treatment Necessary. Standard Treatments Include Diets, Stretching Of The Esophagus (Dilation), And Drugs Such As Corticosteroids, Biological Medications, And Proton Pump Inhibitor Medications. What Did We Want To Find Out? We Wanted To Find Out If The Available Medical Treatments For Eosinophilic Esophagitis Work For Improving Patients' Symptoms, Reducing The Amount Of Allergic Cells When Measured Under A Microscope, And Improving What The Disease Looks Like Under Visual Examination. We Also Wanted To Find Out How Safe They Are And If They Improve Quality Of Life. What Did We Do? We Searched For Randomized Controlled Trials (Studies Where People Are Assigned To One Of Two Or More Treatment Groups Using A Random Method) Comparing Any Medical Treatment For Eosinophilic Esophagitis With Any Other Medical Treatment, In Both Adults And Children. What Did We Find? We Found 41 Studies With 3253 Participants. Eleven Studies Were In Children Only While The Rest Were In A Mix Of Children And Adults. We Identified 19 Comparisons. In This Summary, We Present The Results Of The Two Main Comparisons: Corticosteroids Compared To Placebo And Biologics Compared To Placebo. We Found That Corticosteroids May Be Better Than Placebo At Improving Patients' Symptoms. We Are Highly Certain That Corticosteroids Are Better Than Placebo At Reducing The Amount Of Eosinophils (Allergic Cells) When Measured Under A Microscope. Corticosteroids May Be Better Than Placebo At Improving What The Disease Looks Like Under Visual Examination (Endoscopy). We Also Found That People Taking Corticosteroids May Be Less Likely To Leave A Study Due To Unwanted Or Harmful Effects (Side Effects), And That They Probably Experience A Similar Number Of Both Serious Side Effects And Side Effects In Total, Compared To Placebo. There May Be No Difference Between Corticosteroids And Placebo In The Improvement Of Quality Of Life. We Found That Biologics May Be Better Than Placebo At Improving Patients' Symptoms. It Is Likely That Biologics Are Better Than Placebo At Reducing The Amount Of Allergic Cells When Measured Under A Microscope. Biologics May Be No Different To Placebo At Improving What The Disease Looks Like Under Visual Examination. We Also Found That People On Biologics May Be Equally Likely To Leave A Study Due To Side Effects, Or Have Serious Side Effects, And May Experience Similar Numbers Of Total Side Effects, Compared To Placebo. There May Be No Difference Between Biologics And Placebo In The Improvement Of Quality Of Life. What Are The Limitations Of The Evidence? The Evidence In Children Only Was Quite Limited And We Do Not Know If The Conclusions Above Can Definitely Apply To Children Specifically. Another Limitation Of The Evidence Is That The Outcomes Were Measured In Many Different Ways, Which May Have Weakened Our Conclusions. Other Treatments Used By The Participants Were Also Something That Varied A Lot Between People, And May Have Affected Our Conclusions. Finally, We Were Limited In The Conclusions We Could Make About The Effects Of Sex, Age, Extent Of Disease, Dosage, And Type Of Corticosteroid Or Biologic. How Up‐To‐Date Is This Review?

Herein, We Present A Case Of Heroin  Body-Packing That Resulted In Subsequent Bowel Obstruction. Case Presentation: A  30-Year-Old Male, Who Was Brought From The Prison To The Emergency Department,  Complained Of Abdominal Pain. After The Absence Of Intoxication Symptoms And  Insignificant Plain Abdominal Radiograph Results, Abdominal Computed Tomography  (Ct) Scan Revealed The Presence Of Ingested Packets In The Stomach As Well As In  The Patient'S Small Intestine. Therefore, The Decision Of Surgery Was Immediately  Made For The Patient, And During The Surgery, The Drug Packets Were Entirely  Removed. The Patient Was Discharged In Good General Condition Three Days After  His Surgery. Clinical Discussion: Body Packers Are In Considerable Risk As  Rupture Of Packet Inside The Body And Risk Of Obstruction That Both Of Them May  Be Fatal. Patients Should Be Monitored For Complications, Possible Early  Treatment, And Removal Or Assistance In Expulsion Drug Packets From The Body.  Initially On Plain Abdominal Radiographs, Classic Findings Suggest The Presence  Of Drug Packets.

There Were 593 Patients Who Presented To The Emergency Department With Efi, Defined As Recent Soft Food Ingestion And Inability To Tolerate Oral Secretions. Adequate Follow-Up Was Defined As A Gastroenterology Clinic Visit Or Egd Within 6 Months Of Efi. Out Of These, 149 Patients (25.1%) Had Ner Of Their Efi.

Paediatric Gi Endoscopy Is A Core Competency Every Paediatric  Gastroenterologist Should Possess, And Represents One Of The Most Common  Procedures Performed In Children For Both Diagnostic And Therapeutic Purposes.  Yet There Remains A Dearth Of Literature On The Utility And Outcomes Of  Paediatric Gi Endoscopy In The Asia-Pacific Region. Data On The Diagnostic Value  Of Paediatric Gi Endoscopy Would Be An Important Aspect Of Discussion, With The  Emergence Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ibd) And Eosinophilic Gi Disease As  Increasingly Common Endoscopic Diagnoses. Time-Based Trends In Paediatric Gi  Endoscopy Do Point Towards More Ibd And Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Related  Complications Being Diagnosed, With A Declining Incidence Of Gi Bleeding.  However, The Real-World Diagnostic Value Of Endoscopy In Asia Must Be  Contextualised To The Region-Specific Prevalence Of Paediatric Gi Diseases.  Helicobacter Pylori Infection, Particularly That Of Multidrug-Resistant Strains,  Remains A Highly Prevalent Problem In Specific Regions. Paediatric Functional Gi  Disorders Still Account For The Majority Of Childhood Gi Complaints In Most  Centres, Hence The Diagnostic Yield Of Endoscopy Should Be Critically Evaluated  In The Absence Of Alarm Symptoms. Gi Therapeutic Endoscopy Is Also Occasionally  Required For Children With Ingested Foreign Bodies, Intestinal Polyposis Or  Oesophageal Strictures Requiring Dilation. Endoscopic Haemostasis Is A  Potentially Life-Saving Skill In Cases Of Massive Gi Bleeding Typically From  Varices Or Peptic Ulcers.

Adolescents And Young Adults May Carry Out This Act To Hurt Themselves Or Even Suicide. Often, Most Reports Related To Deliberate Swallowing Are Typically Either Surgical Or Gastrointestinal And Rarely Are Found In Psychiatric Articles; More Often, The Swallowed Foreign Objects (80 - 90%) Are Disposed Of Spontaneously, And 10 - 20% Of Them Require Endoscopy For More Study And Less Than 1% Of Them Need Surgery To Be Removed Or Its Complications. Case Presentation: The Presented Patient Is A 17-Year-Old Girl Admitted To The Psychosomatic Ward Of Afzalipour Hospital Due To Intentional Poisoning. During The Year Before Her Admission, On Three Separate Occasions, She Detached The Knife Blade From Its Haft And Swallowed It. She Underwent Laparotomy Twice, One Time For Sigmoid Tearing And Damage To The Left Ovary, To Remove The Knife And Regeneration Of The Left Ovary And Sigmoid, And Another Time To Remove The Knife In Order Not To Cause Damage To Her Intestines. To Our Knowledge, This Is The First Reported Case In The World In Which An Ovary Has Been Damaged. Further Investigation Into Her Background Shows Some Extent Of Privation Due To Her Family’S Long-Term Economic Problems And Instability; Moreover, Sexual And Physical Abuse Was Also Confirmed. The Patient Was Prescribed Clozapine, Which Decreased Her Suicidal Behavior And Attempts Noticeably. Conclusions: Swallowing Foreign Bodies In This Patient Is Interpreted As Both Self-Punishment And Punishing Others (Those Who Thought They Were Hurt Or May Be Blamed For Their Despair Or Rejection). Intentional Swallowing Of Foreign Objects Behavior Is More Resistant Than Other Self-Harming Activities And May Have A Worse Prognosis. Swallowing Foreign Objects Requires A Sophisticated Process That, If Not Correctly Managed, May Result In Serious Complications; Therefore, Appropriate Psychiatric Counseling And Supportive Treatment Are Necessary For These Patients. Specific To This Patient Eliminating The Effects Of Suicide And Reaching Medical Stability With A Short Admission Was Necessary. Her Suicidal Behavior And Attempts Decreased Significantly After Starting Clozapine Treatment. Therefore, Clozapine Treatment Is Recommended For Patients With Suicidal Behavior And Self-Harm. © 2023, Brieflands. All Rights Reserved.",,,

We Present A Case Of Multifactorial Severe Hypophosphatemia In The Setting Of Chronic Alcoholism And Presumed Refeeding Syndrome. Case Description: A 69 Year Old Male With A History Of Alcohol Use Disorder Presented To The Ed With Generalized Muscle Weakness, Recurrent Falls And Confusion. He Reported Consuming 2 Bottles Of Wine Daily For Several Years, With His Last Drink 24 Hours Prior To Presentation. He Reported A History Of Caloric Restriction With Intentional Weight Loss Followed By A Recent Increase In Caloric Intake In The Preceding Week. His Initial Presentation Was Consistent With Sepsis From Contained Sigmoid Perforation Due To Foreign Body Ingestion, Likely A Chicken Bone. Labs Revealed Phosphorus < 1, Potassium 2.0, Magnesium 1.4, Lactate 8.5, Wbc 6.1 With 34% Band Neutrophils, Mild Alkalosis (Venous Ph 7.43), Pco(2) 42, Hco(3) 24.

Here, We Present An Atypical Case Of Foreign Body Aspiration. Case Presentation: An 18-Year-Old Female With Major Depressive Disorder And Borderline Personality Disorder Presented For Foreign Body Aspiration. She Shared That She Uses A Box Cutter To Inflict Self-Harm And Hides It In Her Mouth. Inadvertently, She Aspirated The Box Cutter And Presented To The Hospital For The Same Reason. Besides A Mild Sore Throat, She Denied Cough, Hemoptysis Or Shortness Of Breath. She Was Hemodynamically Stable On Room Air. Her Aspiration Event Was Confirmed On A Chest X Ray, With A Blade Visualized In The Right Lower Lobe. Pulmonology Was Consulted Emergently With Plans For A Bronchoscopy The Following Morning. A Ct Chest Was Ordered To Confirm The Location Of The Box Cutter. Before This Was Performed, The Patient Spontaneously Expelled The Blade By Coughing Overnight Before Any Intervention Took Place. The Patient Did Not Suffer Any Consequence. Discussion: Physiologically, The Larynx Plays A Protective Role In Preventing Foreign Objects From Being Aspirated Via The Closure Of The Epiglottis, Vocal Cords And Cough Reflex (1). In The Absence Of Risk Factors, Aspiration Of Foreign Objects As In Our Patient Is Unlikely. Additionally, Aspirated Sharp Foreign Objects Are Extremely Hazardous And Pose A Risk Of Catastrophic Complications To The Airway Including Hemorrhage, Post Obstructive Pneumonia, Lung Abscess And Bronchiectasis. Emergent Intervention Using Rigid Bronchoscopy Is Warranted As The Spontaneous And Uneventful Expulsion Of Sharp Objects As In Our Patient, Is Rare In Literature (2). Conclusions: Foreign Body Aspiration Of Sharp Objects Calls For Immediate Intervention Due To The Risk Of Lethal Complications, Given That The Occurrence Of Spontaneous And Atraumatic Expulsion Is Extremely Rare.

There Are Numerous Methods Of Debridement Available, But No Consensus On Which One Is Most Effective For Surgical Wounds. Objectives To Assess The Effects Of Different Methods Of Debridement On The Rate Of Debridement And Healing Of Surgical Wounds. Search Methods In October 2021, We Searched The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, Central, Medline, Embase, And Cinahl. To Identify Additional Studies, We Searched Clinical Trials Registries For Ongoing And Unpublished Studies, And Scanned Reference Lists Of Relevant Included Studies, Reviews, Meta‐Analyses, And Health Technology Reports. There Were No Restrictions On Language, Date Of Publication, Or Study Setting. Selection Criteria We Included Randomised Controlled Trials (Rcts) That Enrolled People With A Surgical Wound That Required Debridement, And Reported Time To Complete Wound Debridement Or Time To Wound Healing, Or Both. Data Collection And Analysis Two Review Authors Independently Performed Study Selection, Risk Of Bias Assessment Using The Rob 1 Tool, Data Extraction, And Grade Assessment Of The Certainty Of Evidence. Main Results In This Fourth Update, We Identified One Additional Study For Inclusion. The Review Now Includes Six Studies, With 265 Participants, Aged Three To 91 Years. Five Studies Were Published Between 1979 And 1990 And One Published In 2014. The Studies Were Carried Out In Hospital Settings In China, Denmark, Belgium, And The Uk. Six Studies Provided Six Comparisons. Due To The Heterogeneity Of Studies, It Was Not Appropriate To Conduct Meta‐Analyses. Four Studies Evaluated The Effectiveness Of Dextranomer Beads/Paste; However, Each Study Used A Different Comparator (Eusol‐Soaked Dressings, 10% Aqueous Polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% Chloramine‐Soaked Packs, And Silicone Foam Elastomer Dressing). One Study Compared Streptokinase/Streptodornase With Saline‐Soaked Dressings, And One Compared Endoscopic Surgical Debridement With Conventional 'Open' Surgical Debridement. Five Studies Reported Time To Complete Debridement (Reported As Time To A Clean Wound Bed) And Three Reported Time To Complete Healing. One Study Reported Effect Estimates (Surgical Debridement Via Endoscopy Versus Surgical Debridement) For Time To A Clean Wound Bed And Time To Complete Wound Healing, And It Was Possible To Calculate Effect Estimates For One Other Study (Dextranomer Paste Versus Silicone Foam Elastomer) For Time To Complete Wound Healing. For The Other Four Studies That Did Not Report Effect Estimates, It Was Not Possible To Calculate Time To A Clean Wound Bed Or Time To Complete Wound Healing Due To Missing Variance And Participant Exclusions. None Of The Included Studies Reported Outcomes Pertaining To Proportion Of Wounds Completely Healed, Rate Of Reduction In Wound Size, Rate Of Infection, Or Quality Of Life. All Studies Had Unclear Or High Risk Of Bias For At Least One Key Domain. Dextranomer Paste/Beads (Autolytic Debridement) Compared With Four Different Comparators Four Studies Compared Dextranomer Paste Or Beads With Eusol‐Soaked Gauze (20 Participants), 10% Aqueous Polyvinylpyrrolidone (40 Participants), 0.1% Chloramine‐Soaked Dressings (28 Participants), Or Silicone Foam Elastomer (50 Participants). There Is Very Low‐Certainty Evidence That There May Be No Clear Difference In Time To A Clean Wound Bed Between Dextranomer Beads And Eusol Gauze. The Study Did Not Report Adverse Events. There Is Very Low‐Certainty Evidence That There May Be No Difference In Time To A Clean Wound Bed Between Dextranomer Paste And 10% Aqueous Polyvinylpyrrolidone Gauze. There Was Low‐Certainty Evidence That There May Be No Difference In Deaths And Serious Adverse Events. There May Be A Difference In Time Until The Wounds Were Clinically Clean And Time To Complete Wound Healing Between Dextranomer Paste And 0.1% Chloramine Favouring 0.1% Chloramine, But We Are Very Uncertain. There Is Low‐Certainty Evidence That There May Be No Difference In Deaths And Serious Adverse Events. There Is Very Low‐Certainty Evidence That There May Be No Difference In Time To Complete Healing Between Dextranomer Beads And Silicone Foam Elastomer. The Study Did Not Report Adverse Events. Streptokinase/Streptodornase Solution (Enzymatic) Compared With Saline‐Soaked Dressings One Study (21 Participants) Compared Enzymatic Debridement With Saline‐Soaked Dressings. There Is Low‐Certainty Evidence That There May Be No Difference In Time To A Clean Wound Bed Or Secondary Suture Between Streptokinase/Streptodornase And Saline‐Soaked Dressings. There Is Very Low‐Certainty Evidence That There May Be No Difference In Deaths And Serious Adverse Events. Surgical Debridement Via Endoscopic ('Keyhole') Surgery Compared With Surgical Debridement By 'Open' Surgery (The Wound Is Opened Using A Scalpel) One Study (106 Participants) Reported Time To Complete Wound Healing And Time To A Clean Wound Bed. There Is Low‐Certainty Evidence That There May Be A Reduction In Time To Complete Wound Healing And Very Low‐Certainty Evidence That There May Be No Difference In Time To A Clean Wound Bed With Surgical Debridement Via Endoscopy Compared To 'Open' Surgical Debridement. The Study Did Not Report Adverse Events. Overall, The Evidence Was Low To Very Low‐Certainty For All Outcomes. Five Included Studies Were Published Before 1991 And Investigated Treatments That Are No Longer Available. Worldwide Production Of Dextranomer Products Has Been Discontinued, Except For Dextranomer Paste, Which Is Currently Only Available In South Africa. Furthermore, Eusol, Used In One Study As The Comparator To Dextranomer, Is Rarely Used Due To Risk Of Harmful Effects On Healthy Tissue And The Enzymatic Agent Streptokinase/Streptodornase Is No Longer Available Worldwide. Authors' Conclusions Evidence For The Effects Of Different Methods Of Debridement On Complete Wound Debridement And Healing Of Surgical Wounds Remains Unclear. Adequately Powered, Methodologically Robust Rcts Evaluating Contemporary Debridement Interventions For Surgical Wounds Are Needed To Guide Clinical Decision‐Making. Plain Language Summary Is There A Best Way To Remove Dead Tissue From Surgical Wounds? Key Message We Cannot Be Certain Whether Removal Of Dead Or Infected Tissue Of Surgical Wounds Or Care That Is Usually Provided Makes Any Difference To How Long It Takes To Remove All Of The Dead Tissue From The Wound And For The Wound To Heal. What Did We Want To Find Out? Following Surgery, Most Surgical Wounds Heal Naturally With No Complications. However, Complications Such As Infection Can Occur, Which May Result In Delayed Healing. There Are Many Different Methods Of Removing Dead Or Infected Tissue (Called Debridement), Such As Surgical Removal Of The Tissue, Enzymes (Naturally Occurring Proteins That Dissolve The Tissue), And Mechanical Methods (For Example, A Special Dry Gauze That Is Removed When The Tissue Has Stuck To It). We Wanted To Look At The Different Ways To Remove Dead Or Infected Tissue From Wounds After Surgical Operations And Find Out How They Affect The Time It Takes To Remove All Of The Dead Tissue From The Wound And For The Wound To Heal. What Did We Do? We Searched Medical Databases For Well‐Designed Studies Including People Of Any Age That Compared One Method Of Debridement Versus A Dummy Treatment (Placebo), No Treatment, Or Another Method Of Debridement After Surgery. What Did We Find? We Found Six Studies Dating From 1979 To 2014 That Compared Different Types Of Wound Debridement With The Way Care Was Usually Provided For Wounds That Had Dead Tissue Within Them After Surgery. All Six Studies Compared Different Types Of Debridement Methods Or Different Types Of Usual Care, Meaning We Could Not Combine The Results. The Total Number Of Participants Within The Studies Was 265, And Ages Of Participants Ranged From Three To 91 Years. The Studies Were Carried Out In Hospitals In China, Denmark, Belgium, And The Uk. Four Studies Compared A Treatment Method That Promotes The Body'S Natural Wound Healing Process (Called Autolytic) With Different Types Of Usual Care. Overall, We Found That This Method May Make Little Or No Difference To How Long It Takes To Remove All Of The Dead Tissue. One Study Compared An Enzyme With Usual Care, And We Found That This Method May Make Little Or No Difference To How Long It Takes To Remove All Of The Dead Tissue. One Study Compared Different Methods Of Removing Dead Tissue Using Surgery (One Via 'Keyhole' Surgery, The Other 'Normal' Surgery). We Found That Using Keyhole Surgery To Remove The Dead Tissue May Have Little Or No Effect On Time For The Wound To Heal, But We Are Very Uncertain About The Results. Only Three Of The Studies (Two Autolytic And One Using An Enzyme) Reported Serious Harmful Events That Led To Discontinuation Of Treatment Or Hospital Admission. There May Be No Difference In Deaths And Serious Harmful Events Between The Treatment Methods. Overall, All The Studies Indicated That It Is Unclear Whether Any Type Of Wound Debridement Is Better Than Usual Care At Reducing Time To Remove All Of The Dead Tissue, Time To Complete Healing, Serious Harmful Events That Led To Discontinuation Of Treatment, Or Hospital Admission. What Are The Limitations Of The Evidence? Overall, We Are Very Uncertain About The Evidence, Mainly Because The Studies Had Small Numbers Of People, And Did Not Report The Results Well. Additionally, Five Studies Used Debridement Products That Are No Longer Used Clinically. How Up To Date Is The Evidence? We Searched For Studies Published Up To October 2021.",,,

Self-Harm Or Suicidal Intent May Be Overlooked Initially In Such Cases, Particularly When The Patient Is Unconscious Or Uncooperative. Correct Identification Of These Findings By The Radiologist Will Allow A Patient'S Management To Be Tailored Accordingly And May Prevent Future Suicide Attempts. The Initial Role Of The Radiologists In These Cases Is To Identify Life-Threatening Injuries That Require Urgent Medical Attention. The Radiologist Can Add Value By Drawing Attention To Associated Injuries, Which May Have Been Missed On Initial Clinical Assessment.

The Functional Oral Intake Scale (Fois) And Karnofsky Performance Status Scale Were Used To Assess The Patients’ Swallowing Status And Functional Abilities, Respectively. The Study Also Evaluated The Relationship Between Swallowing Function And Clinical-Demographic Factors. Results: Our Assessment Of 162 Hnc Patients Found That The Cancer Site Significantly Affects Swallowing. Although 92% Of Patients Had An Oral Diet, 64% Made Dietary Modifications. Patients With Non-Oral Intake Had Either Oral Or Pharyngeal Cancer, And Over 80% Of Oral Cancer Patients And 60% Of Those With Pharyngeal Cancer Had Already Made Changes To Their Diet. Patients With Laryngeal Cancer Had A Better Oral Intake, With 58% Reporting No Swallowing Issues. Conclusion: Patients With Hnc Scheduled For Radiation Therapy May Experience Varying Degrees Of Swallowing Difficulty. Early Intervention And Teaching Of Safe Swallowing Strategies Are Crucial To Prepare For The Potential Worsening Of Swallowing Difficulties Resulting From The Treatment. Advanced Tumor Stages And Oral/Pharyngeal Cancers Increase The Risk Of Significant Swallowing Issues.",,,

Case Reports: Herein, We Describe Successful Cases Of Surgical And Endoscopic Removal After Blister Ingestion. The First Case Was That Of A Polymorbid 75-Year-Old Man Who Presented With Acute Onset Of Abdominal Pain In The Right Upper Quadrant And Epigastric Regions. No Indication Of The Cause Was Observed On Initial Computed Tomography (Ct). The Patient Developed An Acute Abdomen, And Emergency Laparotomy Was Performed, During Which 2 Small Perforations Were Observed In The Terminal Ileum, And An Empty Tablet Blister Was Retrieved. The Second Patient Was A 55-Year-Old Man Who Presented With A Considerable Lack Of Awareness. On The Initial Ct, A Subdural Hematoma, Aspiration, And An Unidentified Foreign Body In The Stomach Were Observed. Gastroscopy Was Performed After Emergency Craniotomy. In Addition To The Initial Foreign Body, A Second Object, Which Had Gone Unnoticed On The Initial Ct, Was Found And Removed From The Esophagus.

Abstract Foreign Body Ingestion [Fbi] Is Rare In Adults As Compared With Children [1]. Foreign Body Ingestion Is Accidental In 95 Percent Of Cases And Is Usually Related To Food [Fish, ...","1. Abstract
Foreign body ingestion [FBI] is rare in adults as compared with
children [1]. Foreign body ingestion is accidental in 95 percent
of cases and is usually related to food [fish, chicken bones, tooth-
picks][2]. Foreign body ingestion in adults occur more frequently
in older adults, in indivuduals with underlying psychiatric diseases
or alcohol intoxification, in prison inmates, and for the purpose of
drug trafficking.[3] Most [80 to 90%] ingested foreign bodies pass
without the need of intervention [4]. Endoscopic intervention is
required in 10 to 20 percent of patients; the urgency for endoscopy
depends on the underlying clinical scenario and the nature of im-
pactation [food versus foreign body] [5]. In some cases, endosco-
py can be avoid if a radiograph immediately prior to the procedure
reveals that the foreign body has passed [6]. Surgical intervention
is required in less than 1 percent [7]. We present the case of a
29-year-old patient with borderline personality disorder who came
to the emergency room of our hospital referred from her psychi-
atric center due to ingestion of several foreign bodies [domino
pieces]. After radiological verification and rejecting endoscopic
treatment by the on-call endoscopist, urgent surgical intervention
was decided to resolve the problem.",,

Previous Data On The Topic Predominantly Comprises ...,"Carotid complications resulting from extra-luminal migration of ingested foreign bodies (FB) are rare but potentially
life-threatening. Previous data on the topic predominantly comprises isolated case reports, leaving a gap in compre-
hensive evidence necessary to guide clinical decision-making. In this article, we offer a narrative review alongside a
novel case report, aimed at providing a broad, evidence-based perspective on the topic to guide clinical practice. The
search strategy employed keywords related to carotid artery complications from ingested FB across the following elec-
tronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Central.
Screening involved standardized data extraction by two independent reviewers, with a focus on abstracts meeting inclu-
sion criteria and excluding non-English literature and non-relevant studies from further analysis. Moreover, we present
a novel case report on the topic that was successfully managed using a unique surgical approach.
Overall, a total of sixteen case reports were finally included, data on clinical presentations, diagnostic strategies and
findings, surgical management and outcome were extracted, tabulated, and discussed.
In carotid complications from extra-luminal migration of ingested FB, high clinical suspicion is crucial due to potentially
mild symptoms and negative first-level examinations. Computed tomography (CT) scan plays a pivotal role for accurate
diagnosis and surgical planning, along with neck ultrasound to detect complications. Tailored surgical strategies based
on the severity of carotid involvement, including venous patch grafts in severe vessels involvement, are crucial for op-
timal patient outcomes. As a novelty, in our case report, carotid shunt was successfully employed instead of prolonged
carotid clamping to reduce the risk of associated neurological sequelae. It could be concluded that diagnosis and man-
aging carotid complications from extra-luminal migration of ingested FB remains challenging and a multidisciplinary
approach is warranted.",,

Pediatric Gastroenterologists And Surgeons Were  Increasingly Tasked With Removing These Problematic Objects. The Purpose Of This  Study Was To Assess The Utility Of Single-Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (Sils) In  The Management Of Ingested Magnets. Patients And Methods: This Is A  Single-Center, Retrospective Assessment Of Surgical Interventions For Ingested  Magnets. International Classification Of Disease, 10Th Revision Codes Were Used  To Identify 349 Patients ≤21 Years Of Age Evaluated For Foreign Body Ingestion  Over A 4.5-Year Period. A Medical Record Review Helped Isolate 29 (8.3%) Magnet  Ingestions, 9 Requiring Surgical Intervention. Redcap Was Used For Analysis.  Results: Of 9 Surgical Patients, 7 Underwent Sils Intervention By 1 Surgeon.  Another Surgeon Performed An Open Operation, Whereas A Third Performed A  Multiport Operation. Of The 7 Sils Cases, 3 Were Completed Without Conversion To  Open. In One Of These Cases, Bowel Resection With Primary Anastomosis Was  Performed. For Sils Cases, Average Operating Room Time Was 109 Minutes (38-170  Minutes), Time To Enteral Feeds Was 23 Hours (0.28-79.2 Hours), And Hospital  Length Of Stay (Los) Was 3.8 Days (1.96-6.68 Days). Thirty-Day Readmission For  Sils Was 14.3%. No Other Complications Were Observed. Conclusions: Sils Has Been  Safely Utilized For Magnet Retrieval. It Offers An Ability To Identify The  Affected Intestinal Segment And An Opportunity To Intervene Extracorporeally  Through An Uncapped Port. In Addition, Knowing Where Matted Bowel Is Located Can  Direct A Limited Incision During Conversion To Laparotomy. This May Confer  Benefits Of Decreased Pain, Shortened Time To Enteral Feeds, And Decreased  Hospital Los.",,,

Treatments Include Supportive Therapy, Antidotes (When Available) And Decontamination Techniques With The Aim Of Reducing Drugs Absorption By The Gastrointestinal System To Minimize Toxicity. Nevertheless, The Decontamination Techniques Currently Used, Such As Gastric Lavage (Gl), Activated Charcoal Or Whole-Bowel Irrigation, Have A Questionable Effectiveness. Endoscopic Gastric Decontamination (Egd) Treatment For Massive Ingestion Of Drugs Or Formation Of Pharmacobezoars Is Currently Described Only In Anecdotal Cases. Here We Describe The Management Of An Intentional Drug Overdose In An Adolescent Patient Treated With Egd And The Effects Of This Therapy On Drugs Pharmacokinetics. Case Report: A 15-Year-Old Boy Was Admitted In An Unconscious State (Glasgow Coma Scale: 7–8) To The Pediatric Intensive Care Unit After Assuming An Unspecified Amount Of Quetiapine, Aspirin, Bisoprolol, Fluoxetine, Furosemide, Alprazolam, And Pregabalin Pills. Rapid Sequence Intubation Was Immediately Performed And Then The Patient Was Treated With Symptomatic Therapy And Gl With Minimal Removal Of Gastric Material. Accounting For The Type Of Drugs, The Time Elapsed From Oral Assumption And The Unknown Quantity Assumed, Egd Was Attempted With Aim Of Removing Potential Aggregate Of The Drugs. Serial Blood Samples Were Taken Before And After Egd To Measure The Plasma Level Of The Drugs. A Pharmacobezoar Was Found And Was Immediately Removed With Egd. The Results Of The Drug Monitoring Showed That Quetiapine Exceeded The Toxic Level Reported In Literature Indicating That It May Have Been The Drug Assumed In Higher Quantity By Our Patient. Picu Stay Was Uneventful, And The Patient Was Transferred To The Psychiatric Ward After Extubation. Discussion: Our Case Shows How Gl Is Not Effective In Mitigating Multidrug Absorption Especially Drugs Potentially Inducing Pharmacobezoars. Furthermore, Based On Our Plasma Drug Monitoring, We Believe That Early Egd Should Be Considered In All Cases Of Massive Pill Intake, Prolonged Release Drugs That Can Form Pharmacobezoars Or In Cases Where A Life-Threatening Dose Cannot Be Excluded.",,,

Methods: A  New Cr2032 Bb And Artificial Saliva Were Placed In A Fresh Pig Esophagus With The  Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve (Rln); The Negative Electrode Faced The Nerve In The  Experimental Group, While The Positive Electrode Faced The Nerve In The Control  Group. The Ph Values Of The Intra- And Extraesophageal Walls Were Measured  Simultaneously. Pathological Examination Was Performed After The Esophagus And  Nerves Were Damaged. Results: After Bb Ingestion, The Ph Near The Intraesophageal  Negative Electrode Increased Rapidly, Reaching 11.5 At 30 Min And Over 14 At 6 H,  While The Extraesophageal Ph Did Not Change At 1 H And Began To Accelerate After  2 H, Reaching 10 At 6 H.
