\subsection*{Data Items}
Outcome data were extracted for rates of endoscopy, surgery, conservative management, mortality, and complications. For the purposes of this study, \textit{surgery} was defined as \enquote{any operative intervention performed in a sterile operating theatre under general or regional anaesthesia, involving incision or surgical access to body cavities (including laparotomy, laparoscopy, thoracotomy, or cervical exploration) for the purpose of removing an ingested object or managing complications of ingestion}. Procedures performed \enquote{solely via flexible or rigid endoscopy through natural orifices} were categorised as \textit{endoscopy} and not considered surgical interventions.

Predictor variables were grouped in five subgroups: \textit{Age Group}, \textit{Gender}, \textit{Demographic}, \textit{Motivation}, \textit{Object}. Motivations are elaborated on here as they are key variables in this review. Intent to harm was defined as ingestion carried out with the purpose of self-harm, self-injury, or suicide. If the ingestion was for another reason, it was recorded as ‘N’. If the intent was unclear, it was marked as ‘UK’. Protest-related ingestion was defined as an act of ingestion carried out as a form of protest, demonstration, or manipulation—for example, in response to detention conditions. If the ingestion was not motivated by protest, it was marked as ‘N’; if unclear, as ‘UK’. Psychosocial motivation included ingestion motivated by social or interpersonal dynamics—such as imitative behaviour, a desire to shock, body-image concerns, or the use of ingestion for safekeeping objects. If these factors were not involved, the case was marked as ‘N’; if unclear, as ‘UK’. Unknown motivation was recorded when no clear motivation was identifiable in the documentation. If a specific motive was documented, this was marked as ‘N’. If the available information was ambiguous, it was recorded as ‘UK’.
