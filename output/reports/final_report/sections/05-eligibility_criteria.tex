\subsection*{Eligibility Criteria}

The review included studies involving human participants of any age who had intentionally ingested foreign objects via the oral cavity. Eligible exposures included deliberate ingestion events, regardless of motivation. Studies were considered if they included data on motivations for ingestion—such as protest, suicidal intent, self-harm, or psychiatric conditions—as well as details regarding management strategies, including whether conservative, endoscopic, or surgical treatment was used. Object-related factors such as type (e.g., blunt, sharp, long, short, multiple objects) were also criteria for inclusion.

Studies were required to report on at least one of the following outcomes: endoscopic intervention, surgical intervention, conservative management, complication rates, or mortality. All clinical settings were eligible, and a wide range of study designs were accepted, including observational studies (cohort, case-control, cross-sectional), case series, clinical trials, and case reports. 

A full list of eligibility criteria is availabe in Appendix~\ref{tab:inclusion-criteria} and a full list of exclusion criteria is available in Appendix~\ref{tab:exclusion-criteria}.
