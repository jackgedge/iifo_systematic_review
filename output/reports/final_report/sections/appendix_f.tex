\section{Results of Synthesis Expanded}
\label{appendix:synthesis_results}
Using the DerSimonian & Laird (DL) method, meta-analysis of proportions was undertaken on endoscopy, surgery, death, complication, and conservative. The pooled proportion of patients that endoscopy was 50.4\% (95\% CI 26.9\%--73.6\%), with substantial heterogeneity ($I^2$ = 90.5\%). The pooled proportion of patients that surgery was 30.5\% (95\% CI 16.5\%--49.4\%), with substantial heterogeneity ($I^2$ = 87.2\%). The pooled proportion of patients that death was 2.5\% (95\% CI 1.1\%--5.5\%), with low heterogeneity ($I^2$ <0.5\%). The pooled proportion of patients that complication was 34.6\% (95\% CI 13.0\%--65.2\%), with substantial heterogeneity ($I^2$ = 94.5\%). The pooled proportion of patients that conservative management was 41.5\% (95\% CI 14.4\%--75.0\%), with substantial heterogeneity ($I^2$ = 93.1\%).
