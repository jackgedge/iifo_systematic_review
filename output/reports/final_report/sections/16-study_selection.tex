\subsection*{Study Selection}

A total of 673 records were identified through initial database searches: PubMed (317), WoS (277), Embase (25), SCOPUS (24), PsycINFO (16), and Cochrane (14).
 
Following the removal of duplicate records—based on combinations of publication year, title, author, and DOI—313 duplicates were excluded. This left 360 unique database records for screening: PubMed (258), Web of Science (65), Cochrane (14), SCOPUS (12), Embase (9), PsycINFO (2).
A Google Scholar search yielded 135 results.
3 duplicates were removed manually. Thus, 132 records proceeded to screening.
Database records (360) and Google Scholar records (132) were then merged, yielding a total of 492 records.

Title and abstract review was then undertaken. JGE reviewed all 492 records. A random sample of 49 records was generated for independent screening MS.
After title and abstract screening, Cohen's Kappa was calculated for inter-reviewer agreement between JGE and MS, yielding a value of 0.38, indicating fair agreement.
Where JGE and MS disagreed, 16 records were reviewed by GC.
In total, 176 records were excluded, leaving 316 for full text review.

During full text review, JGE reviewed all 316 records. 
A random sample of 32 records was generated for independent review by MS. 
Inter-reviewer agreement was calculated using Cohen's Kappa, yielding a value of 0.45, indicating fair agreement.   
Where JGE and MS disagreed, 5 records were reviewed by GC.   
In total, 224 records were excluded during full text review. 92 records were included and proceeded to bibliography search.  

The bibliographies of the 92 included from full text review were searched by JGE manually. A list of included papers were collated using Python Pandas \cite{ThePandasDevelopmentTeam_2020}, ensuring each included item had its bibliography searched. Relevant bibliography items were identified; compared to the eligibility criteria; and collated in Zotero \cite{Stillman_2025}. The bibliography search results were then exported from Zotero as a CSV and input into Pandas for analysis, manipulation and duplicate removal.

In total, 204 records were identified during bibliography searching.
Using \textit{Python Pandas}, bibliography search records were then programatically compared to title and abstract screen and full text review records. In this process, 12 duplicates were identified.
Therefore, 194 full text bibliography search records were reviewed by JGE. 121 bibliography search records were excluded, leaving 73 for inclusion.
