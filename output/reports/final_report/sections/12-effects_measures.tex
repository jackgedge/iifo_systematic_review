\subsection*{Effects Measures}
For binary outcomes (endoscopy, surgery, and death), the effect measure used was the odds ratio (OR), calculated from 2x2 contingency tables. Each odds ratio was accompanied by a 95\% confidence interval (CI) and a p-value from a chi-square test of independence.

This approach was used consistently across all pairwise comparisons between binary exposure variables (e.g., motivations, object types, population characteristics) and binary outcome variables. Significant associations were identified at a threshold of $p < 0.05$ and reported alongside their respective ORs and CIs.
