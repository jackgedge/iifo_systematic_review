\subsection{Eligibility Criteria}
We included original studies involving humans of any age group who had intentionally ingested a foreign object through the oral cavity (mouth). Studies were excluded if the ingestion was not explicitly documented as intentional or if empirical data on individual intentional ingestions were unavailable.

Motivations or reasons for ingestion considered included protest, suicidal intent, self-harm, psychiatric conditions, and other documented motivations. Intervention details assessed included the number of ingestions and the management strategies employed (conservative, endoscopic, surgical). Object characteristics evaluated encompassed the ingestion of multiple, blunt, sharp-pointed, long (\(>5\text{ cm}\)), and short (\(<5\text{ cm}\))
