Magnets Pose A Unique Set Of Risks When Ingested Due To Their Attractive Forces  And Subsequent Risk Of Adherence, Pressure Necrosis, And Perforation  Complications. Radiographs Only Provide A Limited Snapshot In The Setting Of  Multiple Magnet Ingestion When The Risk Of Complication Is Highest. We  Hypothesize That Abdominal Ultrasound (Us) Has The Potential To Supplement  Radiographs In Assessing Ingested Magnets By Determining The Presence Of Bowel  Loop Entrapment And Of Any Extraluminal Fluid. Methods: We Recreated Various  Scenarios Of Magnet Configurations Using Animal Cadaveric Bowel Models. X-Ray And  Us Images Were Obtained In Various Bowel-Magnet Orientations. Results: We  Identified Several Key Us Features To Suggest Bowel Wall Tethering. These Include  Direct Visualization Of Bowel Wall Entrapment Between Magnets (What We Term The  ""Dangerous V Sign""), Anti-Dependent Positions Of The Magnets, And Inability To  Separate Loops Of Bowel With Compression. Conclusion: These Findings Could  Potentially Provide Valuable Information When Directing The Urgency Of  Intervention In Foreign Body Ingestion. Ultrasound May Supplement And Improve The  Current Guidelines In Management Of Magnet Ingestion.",,True,4.0,True,4.0,Exclude,Animal study

METHODS: For children under 15 years, all Victorian public hospital admissions, July 1987 to June 1995, due to asphyxiation or 'foreign body entering through other orifice' (which includes ingestions), were reviewed. Emergency department presentations due to asphyxiation and foreign body ingestion provided information on circumstances of, and the type of foreign bodies involved in the injuries. RESULTS: The childhood average annual admission rate for asphyxiation was 15.1 per 100,000. Food related asphyxiation peaked in infants under 1 year, and declined to low levels by 3 years. The main foods involved were nuts, carrot, apple, and candy. The rate of non-food related asphyxiation was relatively constant to 3 years of age and then declined by 6 years. Mechanical suffocation was less common. The annual admission rate for 'foreign body entering through other orifice' was 31.7 per 100,000. These injuries peaked in 2-3 year olds then gradually declined. About 80% of these foreign body admissions were ingestions, with coins being the major object ingested. Admission rates for these causes remained constant over the eight years. Asphyxiation resulted in a higher proportion admitted and longer hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of suffocation and strangulation needs to focus on a safe sleeping environment and avoidance of ropes and cords, while foreign body asphyxiation and ingestion needs a focus on education of parents and child carers regarding age, appropriate food, risk of play with coins, and other small items. Legislation for toy small parts could be extended to those used by children up to the age of 5 years, and to other products marketed for children. Design changes and warning labels also have a place in prevention.",False,,False,,Unclear,"Likely to be accidental , but might include some intentional foreign objects"

Methods: Children <18Years  Old Who Ingested A Magnet Were Reviewed From 1/2011 To 6/2016 From Two Tertiary  Center Children'S Hospitals. Demographics, Symptoms, Management And Outcomes Were  Analyzed. Results: From 2011 To 2016, There Were 89 Magnet Ingestions (50 From  Hospital 1 And 39 From Hospital 2); 50 (56%) Were Males. Median Age Was 7.9  (4.0-12.0) Years; 60 (67%) Presented With Multiple Magnets Or A Magnet And A  Second Metallic Co-Ingestion. Suspected Locations Found On Imaging Were: Stomach  (53%), Small Bowel (38%), Colon (23%) And Esophagus (3%). Only 35 Patients (39%)  Presented With Symptoms And The Most Common Symptom Was Abdominal Pain (33%). 42  (47%) Patients Underwent An Intervention, In Which 20 (23%) Had An Abdominal  Operation. For Those Undergoing Abdominal Surgery, An Exact Logistic Regression  Model Identified Multiple Magnets Or A Magnet And A Second Metallic Object  Co-Ingestion (Or 12.9; 95% Ci, 2.4 - Infinity) And Abdominal Pain (Or 13.0; 95%  Ci, 3.2-67.8) As Independent Risk Factors.

When Unwitnessed, It Poses Therapeutic And Diagnostic Challenges Especially In The  Presence Of Pre-Existing Anatomical Pathology. We Aim To Analyze The Clinical  Course, Management, And Outcome Of Children With Impacted Esophageal Fbs.  Methods: Retrospective Chart Review (Jan 2000-Feb 2018) Recruiting Children With  Impacted Esophageal Fbs. Fbs In Cricopharynx And Those That Moved To Stomach Were  Excluded. Investigations/Management Were Based On Underlying Anatomical  Pathology, Duration Of Impaction, And Difficult Fbs. Clinical Details,  Management, And Outcomes Were Collated. Results: Of 86 Children, N1 = 31 Had  Identifiable Predisposing Anatomic Pathology And N2 = 55 Had Impactions In Normal  Esophagus Or Difficult Fbs. N1 Group Presented Early (42 Months), Had Recurrent  Impactions (1-6), And Needed Multiple Dilatations (0-8) And Longer Follow-Up (Avg  35 Months). Food Matter Was Commonest Impaction. Many Had Persistent Symptoms. N2  Group Had Commonly Coin Impactions And Strictures Developed In Long Standing Or  Corrosive Fbs. Most Were Asymptomatic. Conclusion: Abnormal Esophageal Anatomy  Predisposes To Impaction With Organic Food Bolus. Age Of Presentation Is Earlier  With Recurrent Impactions Requiring Multiple Dilatations/Surgery And Longer  Follow-Up. Metallic Fbs Commonly Impact In Normal Esophagus And Are Often  Innocuous.

We prospectively evaluated 52 consecutive children who had swallowed coins to determine the incidence of asymptomatic esophageal coins and the rate of spontaneous passage. All patients had a roentgenogram; coins were removed from the esophagus if the patient was symptomatic. Children with asymptomatic esophageal coins were allowed less than 24 hours to pass the coin to the stomach. Thirty children had esophageal coins; of these, 9 (30%) were asymptomatic. The presence of symptoms was significantly associated with esophageal coins, but the absence of symptoms did not reliably exclude the possibility of an esophageal coin. All children who swallow coins should undergo roentgenographic evaluation.",False,,False,,Unclear,Could well include intentional coin ingestion

The Aim Of This Study Was To Present Some  Practical Suggestions For Ingested Safety Pins Using An Accompanying Algorithm,  Presented For The First Time In The Literature To The Best Of Our Knowledge.  Methods: Twenty Children With Ingested Safety Pins During A 4-Year Period Were  Retrospectively Included In The Study. Results: Median Age Of Patients Was 9.5  Months (Interquartile Range, 6.3-14 Months), And 70% Were Girls. On Endoscopic  Examination, Safety Pins Were Observed In The Stomach (25%), Duodenal Bulb (20%),  Upper Esophagus (15%), Middle Esophagus (10%), And Second Part Of The Duodenum  (10%) But Were Not Observed In 20% Of The Cases. Safety Pins Were Removed Using  Endoscopy In 15 Cases (75%). In Four Cases (20%), No Safety Pin Was Observed On  Endoscopic Examination. In One Case (5%) Involving A 6-Month-Old Infant, The  Safety Pin Could Not Be Removed Although It Was Observed Using Endoscopy. No  Surgical Intervention Was Needed For Any Patient. No Complications Such As  Perforation Or Deaths Developed, Except For Erosions, Due To The Foreign Body  Removal Procedure. Conclusion: Safety Pins Are Easily Removed Endoscopically. The  Best Option Is To Remove The Safety Pin Using Endoscopy While It Is Still In The  Esophagus And Stomach. For This Reason, Endoscopic Procedures Should Be Performed  As Soon As Possible In Children Who Have Ingested Safety Pins.",,False,,False,,Unclear,Likely to include intentional ingestion
