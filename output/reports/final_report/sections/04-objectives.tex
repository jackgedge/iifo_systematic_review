\subsection*{Objectives}
This systematic review aims to quantify the rates of endoscopic and surgical interventions following intentional ingestion of foreign objects in human populations. It also seeks to examine how individual factors—such as demographic characteristics, object characteristics and motivations for ingestion (including protest, self-harm, or suicidal intent)—influence the likelihood of requiring endoscopic or surgical procedures and the incidence of complications.
