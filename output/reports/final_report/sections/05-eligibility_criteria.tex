This study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines \cite{Page_2021}. Ethical approval was not required as all analysis was based on published data. Eligibility criteria were structured using the PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, Studies) framework.
