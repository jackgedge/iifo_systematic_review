\subsection*{Certainty of Evidence}

A formal assessment of certainty in the body of evidence (e.g.\ using the GRADE approach) was not performed, as the included evidence was primarily derived from case reports and case series, which are inherently subject to a high risk of bias and lack of control groups. Additionally, heterogeneity across studies was substantial for several outcomes, and reporting was inconsistent across series.

The small number of available case series per outcome, the inclusion of aggregate case report data, and the observational nature of the data all limit the certainty of the synthesised results. As such, the findings of this review should be interpreted as exploratory and hypothesis-generating, rather than providing high-confidence estimates of effect.
