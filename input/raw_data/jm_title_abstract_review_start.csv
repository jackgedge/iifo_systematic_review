In This Study, Aspiration Of Screwdriver  And Healing Abutment Is Reported With Literature Review. Materials And Methods: A  26-Year-Old Male Patient Was Referred From A Local Dental Clinic With The  Suspicion Of Ingestion Of A Screwdriver And Healing Abutment During The  Second-Stage Surgery. The Patient Reported Symptoms Including Dyspnea, Cough, And  Foreign Body Sensation. On The Chest Radiograph, A Radiopaque Foreign Body  Resembling The Screwdriver And Healing Abutment Was Observed At The Right Mid  Lung. Results: Bronchoscopic Examination Using Flexible Cable Was Performed Under  Conscious Sedation, And Microforceps Were Used To Remove The Instruments.  Aspirated Screwdriver And Healing Abutment Were Removed Safely Under Intravenous  Sedation. The Patient Did Not Have Any Symptoms Associated With Lung Aspiration  After Removal Of The Foreign Body During Follow-Up Periods. Conclusion:  Bronchoscopic Removal Is The Most Recommended Procedure For Removal Of The  Aspirated Foreign Body. This Can Be Performed Under Conscious Sedation.  Precautions, Such As Tethering The Screwdriver, Are Recommended During Implant  Procedures.",,,

Compared With Smooth Edged Fbs, Sharp Objects Are More Likely To Be Associated With Significant Adverse Events, When Penetrating The Wall Of The Digestive Tract. The Clinical Features Of Patients Who Experienced Sharp-Pointed Fbs Embedded In Both Sides Of The Duodenum Were Retrospectively Analyzed, As Were The Efficacy And Safety Of Endoscopic Removal Of These Fbs. Patients And Methods: This Retrospective Study Included 21 Adults With Both Sides Of Sharp-Pointed Fbs Embedded Into The Duodenal Wall Who Were Admitted To The Second Xiangya Hospital In China Between January 1, 1996, And May 31, 2021. Data Associated With The Endoscopic Removal Of These Fbs Were Collected From The Electronic Medical Record System (Emrs) Of The Hospital. Results: The Incidence Rate Of Duodenal Total Fbs And Fbs Embedded In Both Sides Was 8.87% And 1.03%, Respectively. The Success Rate Of Endoscopic Treatment Was 100.00% In 124 Patients Without Embedded Duodenal Fbs And 97.14% In 35 Patients With One Side Embedded Duodenal Fbs. Of The 21 Patients With Fbs Embedded In Both Sides Of The Duodenal Wall, Endoscopic Removal Was Successful In 85.71% Of Patients, Whereas 14.29% Required Surgery. Fbs Removed From These Patients Included Toothpicks In 12; Needles In 3; Jujube Pits In 2; And A Chopstick, Dentures, Fish Bones, And Chicken Bones In One Each. Most Of These 21 Fbs Were Located In The Bulb And Descending Duodenum, Followed By The Third Part Of Duodenum. Conclusion: Sharp-Edged Fbs With Both Sides Embedded In The Duodenal Wall Are Rare. Endoscopic Removal May Be Considered As A Feasible, Safe, And Effective Method Of Removing Sharp-Pointed Fbs With Both Sides Embedded In The Duodenal Wall. And If Endoscopic Removal Is Unsuccessful, Surgical Management Can Be A Secondary Option.",,,

Coins Are By Far The Most Common Ingested Foreign Bodies. When Ingested Coins Become Lodged In  The Esophagus, They May Cause Serious Complications If They Are Not Removed In A  Timely Manner. Endoscopic Removal Is The Preferred Treatment In Many Pediatric  Centers As Its Safety And Effectiveness Are Well Established. Objectives: We  Performed This Study To Evaluate Safety And Effectiveness Of An Alternative  Method Of Managing Esophageal Coins, Using Bougienage Technique. Methods:  Previously Healthy Children Presenting To The Local Emergency Room With  Uncomplicated, Witnessed Coin Ingestion Of Less Than 24 Hours Duration Were  Prospectively Recruited With An Intent-To-Treat Analysis. A Single Oral Passage  Of A Hurst Bougie Dilator Was Performed By A Gastroenterologist To Dislodge The  Esophageal Coin Into The Stomach. If Bougienage Was Successful (X-Ray Showing  Coin In The Stomach), Patients Were Discharged And Instructions Were Given For  Monitoring Stools Until Passage Of The Coin Through Anus Was Confirmed. If  Bougienage Was Unsuccessful, The Child Developed Symptoms At Any Time Or If A  Coin Remained Intragastric For 4 Weeks, Endoscopic Removal Was Planned. Children  Whose Parents Declined To Participate In The Bougienage Treatment Received The  Standard Endoscopic Removal And Their Hospital Records Were Used As Controls.  Results: A Total Of 10 Children Were Enrolled In This Study, With A Mean Age Of  3.2 Years (11 Mo To 10 Y), 6 Boys And 4 Girls. All Received Little Or No  Sedation. Nine Children (90%) Were Successfully Treated Using Bougienage, All Of  Whom Spontaneously Passed The Ingested Coins, With A Mean Duration Of 2.6 Days (1  To 7 D) Without Subsequent Intervention. A Single Case Failed Bougienage And  Underwent Endoscopic Removal. Three Children Declined Bougienage Treatment And  Underwent Endoscopic Removal. There Were No Reported Minor Or Major Adverse  Events With Any Of Our Cases. The Mean Health Care Cost For The Hospital Visit  For Bougienage Treatment Was $1210, Compared With $3100 For The Endoscopic  Removal (P<0.001). Furthermore, The Mean Time Spent In The Hospital From  Diagnosis To Discharge Was 2 Hours For Bougienage-Treated Patients Compared With  8 Hours For Endoscopic Treatment (P<0.001). Conclusions: Bougienage Of Impacted  Esophageal Coins Is An Effective, Safe, And More Economic Treatment Modality For  Selected Pediatric Patients With Uncomplicated Coin Ingestion. This Simple  Technique May Provide A Valuable Tool To Emergency Room Physicians Or Primary  Care Doctors Especially When Endoscopy Is Not Readily Available.",,,

A Pubmed And Google Scholar Search  Discovered A Variety Of Case Reports Detailing Various Methods And Indications  For Endoscopic Retrieval Of Right Sided Colonic Foreign Bodies. This Case Report  Endeavors To Supplement The Literature So That Guidelines Can One Day Be  Established For Colonoscopic Retrieval Of Right-Sided Foreign Bodies. Case  Presentation: 36-Year-Old Male Prisoner Swallowed 6.5 Cm Nail Clippers With A  Long-Standing History Of Intentional Foreign Body Ingestion (Fbi) Including  Multiple Laparotomies For Foreign Body Retrievals. Computerized Tomography (Ct)  Was Used Initially To Confirm The Position Of The Nail Clippers. After Almost Two  Weeks Of Failure Of The Foreign Body (Fb) To Move Beyond The Caecum As  Demonstrated On Plain Abdominal X-Rays, The Patient Had A Colonoscopy With  Successful Retrieval Of The Fb. Clinical Discussion: This Case Report Hopes To  Encourage The Consideration Of Colonoscopy For Retrieval Of Right Sided Colonic  Foreign Bodies That Have Failed To Pass On Their Own And Where An Operation May  Come With Increased Risk (Multiple Laparotomies, Multiple Comorbidities, And  Higher Anaesthetic Risk For A General Anaesthetic).

Paediatric Gi Endoscopy Is A Core Competency Every Paediatric  Gastroenterologist Should Possess, And Represents One Of The Most Common  Procedures Performed In Children For Both Diagnostic And Therapeutic Purposes.  Yet There Remains A Dearth Of Literature On The Utility And Outcomes Of  Paediatric Gi Endoscopy In The Asia-Pacific Region. Data On The Diagnostic Value  Of Paediatric Gi Endoscopy Would Be An Important Aspect Of Discussion, With The  Emergence Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ibd) And Eosinophilic Gi Disease As  Increasingly Common Endoscopic Diagnoses. Time-Based Trends In Paediatric Gi  Endoscopy Do Point Towards More Ibd And Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Related  Complications Being Diagnosed, With A Declining Incidence Of Gi Bleeding.  However, The Real-World Diagnostic Value Of Endoscopy In Asia Must Be  Contextualised To The Region-Specific Prevalence Of Paediatric Gi Diseases.  Helicobacter Pylori Infection, Particularly That Of Multidrug-Resistant Strains,  Remains A Highly Prevalent Problem In Specific Regions. Paediatric Functional Gi  Disorders Still Account For The Majority Of Childhood Gi Complaints In Most  Centres, Hence The Diagnostic Yield Of Endoscopy Should Be Critically Evaluated  In The Absence Of Alarm Symptoms. Gi Therapeutic Endoscopy Is Also Occasionally  Required For Children With Ingested Foreign Bodies, Intestinal Polyposis Or  Oesophageal Strictures Requiring Dilation. Endoscopic Haemostasis Is A  Potentially Life-Saving Skill In Cases Of Massive Gi Bleeding Typically From  Varices Or Peptic Ulcers.

Endoscopic Methods [Endoscopic Ultrasound (Eus), Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (Ercp)] ...","ntroduction: Pediatric chronic pancreatitis is increasingly diagnosed.
Endoscopic methods [endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)] are useful tools to diagnose and manage
chronic pancreatitis. Pediatric knowledge and use of these modalities is
limited and warrants dissemination.
Methods: Literature review of publications relating to use of ERCP and EUS
for diagnosis and/or management of chronic pancreatitis with special attention
to studies involving 018 years old subjects was conducted with summaries
generated. Recommendations were developed and voted upon by authors.
Results: Both EUS and ERCP can be used even in small children to assist in
diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in cases where cross-sectional imaging is
not sufficient to diagnose or characterize the disease. Children under 15 kg
for EUS and 10 kg for ERCP can be technically challenging. These
procedures should be done optimally by appropriately trained endoscopists
and adult gastroenterology providers with appropriate experience treating
children. EUS and ERCP-related risks both include perforation, bleeding and
pancreatitis. EUS is the preferred diagnostic modality over ERCP because of
lower complication rates overall. Both modalities can be used for management
of chronic pancreatitis -related fluid collections. ERCP has successfully been
used to manage pancreatic duct stones.
Conclusion: EUS and ERCP can be safely used to diagnose chronic pancreatitis
in pediatric patients and assist in management of chronic pancreatitis-related
complications. Procedure-related risks are similar to those seen in adults, with
EUS having a safer risk profile overall. The recent increase in pediatric-trained
specialists will improve access of these modalities for children.",,

Torture and ill-treatment are usually committed in a clandestine fashion and using increasingly sophisticated methods with a deliberate attempt to reduce any physical evidence of its practice. Mistreatment and torture of others are instruments to torment prisoners. This chapter highlights the uses and the limitations of diagnostic imaging. Physical ill-treatment may include any part or parts of the body, including hand and arm, foot and leg, torso, genitalia, and head and neck. Ill-treatment involving the head can produce a spectrum of injuries from contusions, to lacerations, to hemorrages, to skull fractures and, in some cases, may be fatal injuries.

Several Brands Of These  Expanding Wood Glues (Those Containing Diphenylmethane Diisocyanate [Mdi]) Have  The Potential To Form Gastrointestinal (Gi) Foreign Bodies If Ingested. The  Ingested Adhesive Forms An Expanding Ball Of Glue In The Esophagus And Gastric  Lumen. This Expansion Is Caused By A Polymerization Reaction Using The Heat,  Water, And Gastric Acids Of The Stomach. A Firm Mass Is Created That Can Be 4-8  Times Its Original Volume. As Little As 2 Oz Of Glue Have Been Reported To  Develop Gastric Foreign Bodies. The Obstructive Mass Is Reported To Form Within  Minutes Of Ingestion Of The Adhesive. The Foreign Body Can Lead To Esophageal  Impaction And Obstruction, Airway Obstruction, Gastric Outflow Obstruction,  Mucosal Hemorrhage, Ulceration, Laceration, Perforation Of The Esophageal And  Gastric Linings, And Death. Clinical Signs Following Ingestion Include Anorexia,  Lethargy, Vomiting, Tachypnea, And Abdominal Distention And Pain, And Typically  Develop Within 12 Hours. Clinical Signs May Depend Upon The Size Of The Mass. If  Left Untreated, Perforation And Rupture Of The Esophagus Or Stomach Can Occur.  The Glue Mass Does Not Stick To The Gi Mucosa And Is Not Always Detectable On  Abdominal Palpation. Radiographs Are Recommended To Confirm The Presence Of The  ""Glue-Ball"" Foreign Body, And Radiographic Evidence Of The Obstruction May Be  Seen As Early As 4-6 Hours Following Ingestion. Emesis Is Contraindicated Owing  To The Risk Of Aspiration Of The Glue Into The Respiratory Tree Or The Subsequent  Lodging Of The Expanding Glue Mass In The Esophagus. Likewise, Efforts To Dilute  The Glue And Prevent The Formation Of The Foreign Body Through Administration Of  Liquids, Activated Charcoal, Or Bulk-Forming Products To Push The Foreign Body  Through The Gi Tract Have Proven Ineffective. Even Endoscopy Performed To Remove  The Foreign Body Has Been Shown To Be Unreliable. The Safest, Most Effective, And  Successful Therapy Is Surgical Intervention To Remove The Gi Foreign Body. If  Performed Early Enough, Complete Recovery Of The Animal Can Be Expected.  Differential Diagnoses For Polyurethane Adhesive Ingestion Include Any Potential  Cause Of Gi Obstruction.

Information Regarding Psychiatric Risk Indicators Was Extracted From Participants’ Psychiatric Records. Generalized Linear Models With Negative Binomial Distribution And Log Link Function, As Well As Chi-Square Tests, Were Used To Address Study Aims. Clients With A Lifetime Atypical/Severe Nssi History Met Criteria For A Significantly Greater Number Of Psychiatric Risk Indicators Than Clients With A Lifetime History Of Common Nssi Only; However, These Clients Were Not Significantly More Likely To Report Recent Suicidal Actions. Individuals With An Atypical/Severe Nssi History May Demonstrate More Severe Psychopathology Than Those With A History Of Common Nssi Only. Thus, It May Be Clinically Useful To Consider Individuals With An Atypical/Severe Nssi History As A High-Risk Subgroup. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All Rights Reserved.",,,

Rigid esophagoscopy for extraction of ingested foreign bodies is the recommended treatment. The purpose of this study was to present our experience with rigid esophagoscopy in removal of esophageal foreign bodies.

Material & Methods: This descriptive study was carried out from 1st January 2007 to 31st December 2011, in Department of ENT, Head & Neck Surgery, DHQ Teaching Hospital, D.I.Khan. One hundred and fifty five patients with suspected esophageal foreign bodies, irrespective of age and gender were included in the study. Rigid esophagoscopy under general anesthesia was performed by experienced ENT consultant. Each patient was studied for age, gender, symptomatology, site of impaction, type of foreign body extracted, and complications encountered. All patients were observed for 24 hours in the ward after procedure.

Results: A total of 155 suspected cases of esophageal foreign bodies were managed successfully, comprising 97(62.6%) males and 58(37.4%) females. Mean age of the patients was 32.55+26.66, range1-80 years. Dysphagia was the major complaint 131(84.5%) by these patients. Coins were the predominant FB in children 64(41.3%), while meat bolus 38(24.5%), fish bones 12(7.75%), chicken bones 9(9.5%) and dentures 14(9.05%) were predominant in adult population. Most of the objects 98(63.22%) were lodged in upper esophagus. No mortality encountered in our series.",,

Sharp Metallic Objects Pose A Risk Of Perforation To The Entire Gi Tract And Are Often Difficult To Visualize Among Food And Other Matter In The Stomach. Methods: Three Patients With Histories Of Multiple Ingestions Are Considered. Metallic Foreign Bodies Can Be Easily Removed Using A Nasal Bridle. A Snare And Magnetic Catheter Are Used As Endoscopic Tools To Extract Various Metallic Items. Results: The Bridle Technique Was Used In 68 Endoscopies In 3 Patients Who Presented Numerous Times For Foreign Body Ingestions. The Technique Was Successful In 66 Of The 68 Procedures, With No Adverse Events. Conclusions: The Bridle Technique Is An Easy And Effective Way To Remove Metallic Foreign Bodies And Has Many Advantages Over Traditional, Mechanical Modes Of Foreign Body Retrieval.",,,

A review of patients treated over a 5-year period identified 367 children from whom aerodigestive tract foreign bodies were removed. Seventeen percent of these patients were 5 years of age or older. Among these children, 88% aspirated nonfood items, half of which were school supplies; 78% of the group 5 years old and under aspirated food items. Among older children with esophageal foreign bodies, 31 % had food impactions, compared with 7% in the younger group; 70% of these children had a history of some anatomic abnormality of the esophagus. These data suggest that older children and adolescents represent a distinct group of patients at risk for foreign body accidents. Pediatricians and parents of children in this age group should discourage the practice of using the oral cavity as a repository for school supplies, and should stress the need for adequate preparation and mastication of food, particularly among children with esophageal abnormalities.",,
