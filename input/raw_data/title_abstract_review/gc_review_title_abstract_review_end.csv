Magnets Pose A Unique Set Of Risks When Ingested Due To Their Attractive Forces  And Subsequent Risk Of Adherence, Pressure Necrosis, And Perforation  Complications. Radiographs Only Provide A Limited Snapshot In The Setting Of  Multiple Magnet Ingestion When The Risk Of Complication Is Highest. We  Hypothesize That Abdominal Ultrasound (Us) Has The Potential To Supplement  Radiographs In Assessing Ingested Magnets By Determining The Presence Of Bowel  Loop Entrapment And Of Any Extraluminal Fluid. Methods: We Recreated Various  Scenarios Of Magnet Configurations Using Animal Cadaveric Bowel Models. X-Ray And  Us Images Were Obtained In Various Bowel-Magnet Orientations. Results: We  Identified Several Key Us Features To Suggest Bowel Wall Tethering. These Include  Direct Visualization Of Bowel Wall Entrapment Between Magnets (What We Term The  ""Dangerous V Sign""), Anti-Dependent Positions Of The Magnets, And Inability To  Separate Loops Of Bowel With Compression. Conclusion: These Findings Could  Potentially Provide Valuable Information When Directing The Urgency Of  Intervention In Foreign Body Ingestion.

On The Chest Radiograph, A Radiopaque Foreign Body  Resembling The Screwdriver And Healing Abutment Was Observed At The Right Mid  Lung.

METHODS: For children under 15 years, all Victorian public hospital admissions, July 1987 to June 1995, due to asphyxiation or 'foreign body entering through other orifice' (which includes ingestions), were reviewed. Emergency department presentations due to asphyxiation and foreign body ingestion provided information on circumstances of, and the type of foreign bodies involved in the injuries. RESULTS: The childhood average annual admission rate for asphyxiation was 15.1 per 100,000. Food related asphyxiation peaked in infants under 1 year, and declined to low levels by 3 years. The main foods involved were nuts, carrot, apple, and candy. The rate of non-food related asphyxiation was relatively constant to 3 years of age and then declined by 6 years. Mechanical suffocation was less common. The annual admission rate for 'foreign body entering through other orifice' was 31.7 per 100,000. These injuries peaked in 2-3 year olds then gradually declined. About 80% of these foreign body admissions were ingestions, with coins being the major object ingested. Admission rates for these causes remained constant over the eight years. Asphyxiation resulted in a higher proportion admitted and longer hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of suffocation and strangulation needs to focus on a safe sleeping environment and avoidance of ropes and cords, while foreign body asphyxiation and ingestion needs a focus on education of parents and child carers regarding age, appropriate food, risk of play with coins, and other small items. Legislation for toy small parts could be extended to those used by children up to the age of 5 years, and to other products marketed for children. Design changes and warning labels also have a place in prevention.",FALSE,,TRUE,3,FALSE,,Unclear,"Likely to be accidental , but might include some intentional foreign objects"

Methods: The Esophageal Structure And  Function Of 8 Patients Treated For Afbi Requiring Endoscopic Removal Of  Alimentary Foreign Bodies In 6 Of Them (Up To 4 Times In 1 Case) Were  Investigated By Barium Meal, Esophagoscopy-Biopsy, Ph-Metering, Pull-Through  Stationary Manometry, And 24-Hour Ambulatory Manometry. The Results Were Compared  With Those In A Group Of Age-Matched Regular Refluxers (N = 14) Without Afbi.  Results: Six Boys And 2 Girls Aged 108 +/- 59 Months Had Impaction. Six Children  Had Symptoms Of Ger Like Vomiting During Infancy, Heartburn, Or Respiratory Tract  Disease. Barium Swallow Ruled Out Stenosis In All Patients And Showed Small  Hiatal Hernias In 3. All Had Endoscopic And Histologic Esophagitis (Moderate To  Severe In 6), And One Had Schatzki Ring.

Paediatric Gi Endoscopy Is A Core Competency Every Paediatric  Gastroenterologist Should Possess, And Represents One Of The Most Common  Procedures Performed In Children For Both Diagnostic And Therapeutic Purposes.  Yet There Remains A Dearth Of Literature On The Utility And Outcomes Of  Paediatric Gi Endoscopy In The Asia-Pacific Region. Data On The Diagnostic Value  Of Paediatric Gi Endoscopy Would Be An Important Aspect Of Discussion, With The  Emergence Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ibd) And Eosinophilic Gi Disease As  Increasingly Common Endoscopic Diagnoses. Time-Based Trends In Paediatric Gi  Endoscopy Do Point Towards More Ibd And Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Related  Complications Being Diagnosed, With A Declining Incidence Of Gi Bleeding.  However, The Real-World Diagnostic Value Of Endoscopy In Asia Must Be  Contextualised To The Region-Specific Prevalence Of Paediatric Gi Diseases.  Helicobacter Pylori Infection, Particularly That Of Multidrug-Resistant Strains,  Remains A Highly Prevalent Problem In Specific Regions. Paediatric Functional Gi  Disorders Still Account For The Majority Of Childhood Gi Complaints In Most  Centres, Hence The Diagnostic Yield Of Endoscopy Should Be Critically Evaluated  In The Absence Of Alarm Symptoms. Gi Therapeutic Endoscopy Is Also Occasionally  Required For Children With Ingested Foreign Bodies, Intestinal Polyposis Or  Oesophageal Strictures Requiring Dilation. Endoscopic Haemostasis Is A  Potentially Life-Saving Skill In Cases Of Massive Gi Bleeding Typically From  Varices Or Peptic Ulcers.
