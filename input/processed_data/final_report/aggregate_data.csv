In addition, the high reported incidence of past suicide attempts by other methods is startling. In our sample, a remarkable 84 percent descnibed a history ofsuicide attempts, and most of these attempts occurred before imprisonment. Also common in this sample was psychosis. About three-quarters of the patients were judged by the psy chiatnic consultant to have bad corn mand hallucinations, suicidal idea tion, or both. In addition, the swat lowing ofantennae and toothbrushes can be construed as psychotic behav ion. Psychosis may have occurred in the setting of schizophrenia; almost a third of the sample had that diagnosis. No patient swallowed a foreign body before his first impnisonment. Desire to leave prison may explain this behavior, as may suicidal idea tion in response to incarceration. Sm cide pacts or copycat phenomena may contribute to foreign body in gestion in prison; two ofthe patients had shared a razor blade, each swal lowing half.
