\toprule
\textbf{\#} & \textbf{Exclusion Criterion} \\
\midrule

1 & Full text not available in English. \\

2 & Studies not focusing on intentional self-ingestion (into the gastrointestinal tract) of foreign object via the oral cavity (mouth) or where unclear if ingested. \\

3 & Studies focussing solely on accidental ingestion. \\

4 & Non-human or animal studies. \\

5 & Reviews, editorials, commentaries, and opinion pieces without original empirical data. \\

6 & Duplicate publications or studies with overlapping data sets (the most comprehensive or recent study will be included). \\

7 & Studies focusing on ingestion or co-ingestion of substances (e.g. poisons, medications) rather than physical foreign objects. \\

8 & Ingestions undertaken in controlled environments as part of a voluntary study. \\

9 & Ingestions not explicitly stated to be intentional and history not suggestive of deliberate ingestion (i.e. Age < 8, no history of previous ingestions, no psychiatric co-morbidities, not a prisoner/detainee/vulnerable group). \\

10 & Does not meet inclusion criteria. \\

11 & Ingestions where death resulted from other means (i.e. suicide). \\

12 & Studies before the advent of endoscopy (1906). \\
