"CD007352.PUB3","Hardman, J; Sharma, N; Smith, J; Nankivell, P","Conservative management of oesophageal soft food bolus impaction","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2020","Abstract - Background Impaction of a soft food bolus in the oesophagus causes dysphagia and regurgitation. If the bolus does not pass spontaneously, then the patient is at risk of aspiration, dehydration, perforation, and death. Definitive management is with endoscopic intervention, recommended within 24 hours. Prior to endoscopy, many patients undergo a period of observation, awaiting spontaneous disimpaction, or may undergo enteral or parenteral treatments to attempt to dislodge the bolus. There is little consensus as to which of these conservative strategies is safe and effective to be used in this initial period, before resorting to definitive endoscopic management for persistent impaction. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of non‐endoscopic conservative treatments in the management of soft food boluses impacted within the oesophagus. Search methods We searched the following databases, using relevant search terms: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL. The date of the search was 18 August 2019. We screened the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews on the topic to identify any additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of the management of acute oesophageal soft food bolus impaction, in adults and children, reporting the incidence of disimpaction (confirmed radiologically or clinically by return to oral diet) without the need for endoscopic intervention. We did not include studies focusing on sharp or solid object impaction. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Main results We identified 890 unique records through the electronic searches. We excluded 809 clearly irrelevant records and retrieved 81 records for further assessment. We subsequently included one randomised controlled trial that met the eligibility criteria, which was conducted in four Swedish centres and randomised 43 participants to receive either intravenous diazepam followed by glucagon, or intravenous placebos. The effect of the active substances compared with placebo on rates of disimpaction without intervention is uncertain, as the numbers from this single study were small, and the rates were similar (38% versus 32%; risk ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 0.51 to 2.75, P = 0.69). The certainty of the evidence using GRADE for this outcome is low. Data on adverse events were lacking. Authors' conclusions There is currently inadequate data to recommend the use of any enteral or parenteral treatments in the management of acute oesophageal soft food bolus impaction. There is also inadequate data regarding potential adverse events from the use of these treatments, or from potential delays in definitive endoscopic management. Caution should be exercised when using any conservative management strategies in these patients. Plain language summary Use of treatments to dislodge soft foods stuck between the throat and the stomach to try to avoid the need for an endoscopy Review question Can a period of observation, treatment with swallowed substances, or treatment with substances given via the blood help to dislodge soft foods that are stuck between the throat and the stomach in order to avoid the need for an endoscopic procedure to clear it? Background Food can sometimes get stuck in the oesophagus, the pipe connecting the throat to the stomach that passes through the chest. This food often dislodges on its own, without any medical help, but occasionally a doctor's help is needed to clear it. Removing or dislodging these lumps of food can be done using a flexible camera or a rigid instrument, called an endoscope, but endoscopic procedures can have serious complications, like causing holes in the oesophagus. However, waiting for too long for the food to clear on its own can also increase the risk of a hole in the oesophagus and may lead to saliva or food falling into the lungs, causing serious infections. A variety of treatments are currently used to try to clear the food, without having to resort to an endoscopy, many of which also have potential side effects, including difficulty breathing, increased blood sugar levels, low blood pressure, and irregular heartbeat. We wanted to know if any of these treatments were better than simply waiting for the food to clear on its own, before trying to dislodge it with instruments. Study characteristics The evidence is current to August 2019. We found one trial suitable to answer our question, which compared giving a patient two drugs into a vein in (diazepam and glucagon) to placebos (clear liquids which appeared similar to the drugs but have no effect on the body). We did not look at treating sharp or hard objects, as these are treated differently. Key results There was not enough evidence to say with certainty which treatments for food impacted in the oesophagus are safe or effective. Quality of the evidence We graded the overall certainty of the evidence as low. More studies with more participants are needed to be able to answer the review question.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Conservative Treatment [*methods]; Deglutition Disorders [etiology, *therapy]; Diazepam [*administration & dosage]; Food [*adverse effects]; Gastrointestinal Agents [*administration & dosage]; Glucagon [*administration & dosage]; Humans; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Muscle Relaxants, Central [*administration & dosage]; Placebos [administration & dosage]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD007352.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007352.pub3","Gut"
"CD006204.PUB3","Agnihotry, A; Fedorowicz, Z; Nasser, M; Gill, KS","Resorbable versus titanium plates for orthognathic surgery","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2017","Abstract - Background Recognition of some of the limitations of titanium plates and screws used for the fixation of bones has led to the development of plates manufactured from bioresorbable materials. Whilst resorbable plates appear to offer clinical advantages over metal plates in orthognathic surgery, concerns remain about the stability of fixation and the length of time required for their degradation and the possibility of foreign body reactions. This review compares the use of titanium versus bioresorbable plates in orthognathic surgery and is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2007. Objectives To compare the effects of bioresorbable fixation systems with titanium systems used during orthognathic surgery. Search methods Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 20 January 2017); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 11) in the Cochrane Library (searched 20 January 2017); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 20 January 2017); and Embase Ovid (1980 to 20 January 2017). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov ( clinicaltrials.gov ; searched 20 January 2017), and the  World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform  (searched 20 January 2017) for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing bioresorbable versus titanium fixation systems used for orthognathic surgery in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the results of the electronic searches, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We resolved disagreement by discussion. Clinical heterogeneity between the included trials precluded pooling of data, and only a descriptive summary is presented. Main results This review included two trials, involving 103 participants, one comparing titanium with resorbable plates and screws and the other titanium with resorbable screws. Both studies were at high risk of bias and provided very limited data for the primary outcomes of this review. All participants in one trial suffered mild to moderate postoperative discomfort with no statistically significant difference between the two plating groups at different follow‐up times. Mean scores of patient satisfaction were 7.43 to 8.63 (range 0 to 10) with no statistically significant difference between the two groups throughout follow‐up. Adverse effects reported in one study were two plate exposures in each group occurring between the third and ninth months. Plate exposures occurred mainly in the posterior maxillary region, except for one titanium plate exposure in the mandibular premolar region. Known causes of infection were associated with loosened screws and wound dehiscence with no statistically significant difference in the infection rate between titanium (3/196), and resorbable (3/165) plates. Authors' conclusions We do not have sufficient evidence to determine if titanium plates or resorbable plates are superior for fixation of bones after orthognathic surgery. This review provides insufficient evidence to show any difference in postoperative pain and discomfort, level of patient satisfaction, plate exposure or infection for plate and screw fixation using either titanium or resorbable materials. Plain language summary Resorbable versus titanium plates for corrective jaw surgery Review question Are resorbable (biodegradable) plates better than titanium (metal) plates for the fixation of facial bones after corrective (orthognathic) jaw surgery? Background Under‐ or overgrowth of one or both of the jaw bones can lead to reduced function and an unattractive facial appearance, either of which may have lasting and significant psychosocial effects. Treatment of severe cases may require a combination of orthodontic appliances and orthognathic (corrective jaw) surgery. After surgery the cut bone needs to be immobilised to ensure that optimal healing takes place. Titanium plates used for fixation are recognised to be the 'gold standard' but recent developments in biomaterials have led to an increased use of bioresorbable plates or screws for corrective jaw surgery. The use of bioresorbable plates for the fixation of facial bones might appear to reduce the need for a further operation for the removal of metal plates. However, whilst resorbable plates do appear to offer certain advantages over metal plates, concerns remain about the stability of fixation, the length of time required for their resorption (being reabsorbed), the possibility of foreign body reactions, and with some of the technical difficulties experienced with resorbable plates. Study characteristics We included two studies that analysed a total of 103 participants. The evidence in this review is up to date as of 20 January 2017. Study participants were adults older than 16 years of age. One study compared titanium with resorbable plates and screws and the other titanium with resorbable screws. One study was conducted in China, the other in Germany. Key results Both studies were at high risk of bias and provided very limited data. We do not have sufficient evidence to determine if titanium plates or resorbable plates are superior for the fixation of bones after corrective jaw surgery. This review provides insufficient evidence to show any difference in postoperative pain and discomfort, level of patient satisfaction, plate exposure or infection for plate and screw fixation using either titanium or resorbable materials. Quality of the evidence Both included studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias and the very limited and weak evidence was of very low quality.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Absorbable Implants; *Bone Plates; *Internal Fixators; *Titanium; Bone Screws; Device Removal; Humans; Mandible [*surgery]; Maxilla [*surgery]; Osteotomy [methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD006204.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006204.pub3","Oral Health"

Speech and language therapy forms the initial mainstay of management in cases of UVFP, since up to 60% of cases will resolve spontaneously. If vocal fold paralysis persists surgery, in the form of injection medialisation, has been shown to be an effective intervention. What is currently unclear is which is the most effective material available for injection. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of alternative injection materials in the treatment of UVFP. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 23 March 2012. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of injectable materials in patients with UVFP. The outcomes of interest were patient and clinician‐reported improvement, and adverse events. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies from the search results and extracted data. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess study quality. Main results We identified no RCTs which met the inclusion criteria for this review. We excluded 18 studies on methodological grounds: 16 non‐randomised studies; one RCT due to inadequate randomisation and inclusion of non‐UVFP patients; and one RCT which compared two different particle sizes of the same injectable material. Authors' conclusions There is currently insufficient high‐quality evidence for, or against, specific injectable materials for patients with UVFP. Future RCTs should aim to provide a direct comparison of the alternative materials currently available for injection medialisation. Plain language summary Alternative materials injected into the vocal fold (cord) for unilateral vocal fold paralysis Paralysis of one of the vocal folds (vocal cords) can have a significant impact upon a patient's quality of life. The affected patient may suffer with poor voice, breathlessness and problems with their swallowing. The treatment options include voice therapy, injection to the vocal cord or open surgery. The injection of a material into the affected vocal fold aims to improve voice, breathlessness and prevent episodes of aspiration (choking). There are a wide variety of injectable materials available and this review aimed to assess their effectiveness. Our systematic review of the relevant literature could not identify any randomised controlled trials of sufficient quality to include in this review. There is currently insufficient high‐quality evidence to support the effectiveness of any particular injectable material. Further, well‐designed, robust research is required in this area.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Biocompatible Materials [*administration & dosage]; Humans; Injections [methods]; Vocal Cord Paralysis [pathology, *therapy]; Vocal Cords [pathology]","10.1002/14651858.CD009239.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009239.pub2","ENT"
"CD005606.PUB2","Sunkaraneni, VS; Jones, SEM","Topical anaesthetic or vasoconstrictor preparations for flexible fibre‐optic nasal pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2011","Abstract - Background Nasal pharyngolaryngoscopy (NPL) is performed as an outpatient and inpatient procedure on a daily basis, for a variety of indications. It frequently causes some degree of discomfort to the patient. Various different topical agents, which are intended to reduce this discomfort, are in common use. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of the various agents. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of topical preparations used to reduce discomfort and facilitate NPL in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 14 April 2010. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) looking at the effect of topical anaesthetic or vasoconstrictor agents used reduce discomfort and facilitate NPL in adult patients. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for further information where necessary. The primary outcome measured was pain/discomfort. Secondary outcomes that were looked at included side effects of the topical medications, ease of the procedure and the quality of the view from the operator's perspective. Main results We included eight RCTs (746 participants) in the review. The risk of bias in the studies was generally low. Five studies did not demonstrate any advantage in using a topical treatment prior to endoscopy. One study suggested that a vasoconstrictor alone should be used to reduce the general level of unpleasantness. Two studies did not compare treatment against placebo or no treatment, so it was not possible to draw meaningful conclusions from them. There may be some unpleasant side effects from the use of topical preparations, such as unpleasant taste. There was variation in the format of the outcome data and a lack of complete data; none of the included studies reported their results in a way that would allow pooling and we could not therefore perform meta‐analysis. Authors' conclusions The included studies do not demonstrate any evidence to support the use of topical treatments prior to the use of a fibre‐optic nasal endoscope. Some go as far as to suggest that these agents should not be used due to cost and unpleasant side effects. Five studies did not demonstrate any advantage in terms of reducing pain or discomfort when using a topical treatment prior to endoscopy. The absence of demonstrable effect may be due to relatively small patient groups. It is therefore possible that there is a small effect of using these sprays. Further research using standardised reporting methods is needed. Plain language summary Topical anaesthetic or vasoconstrictor (blood vessel narrowing) preparations for flexible fibre‐optic nasal pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy Topical medications are often applied to the inside of a patient's nose prior to examining the nose, sinuses and throat with a flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscope. The aim of this is to reduce any discomfort the patient may feel and also to improve the adequacy of the examination. Types of preparation include lidocaine, phenylephrine and lidocaine, oxymetazoline, xylometazoline and cocaine and they are usually administered as a spray, although they may also be in the form of a solution which can be applied to cotton wool and placed in the nasal cavity, or as gels, pastes or creams. We looked for randomised controlled trials comparing any of these topical treatments with placebo, no treatment or another topical treatment in adult patients undergoing nasal pharyngolaryngoscopy (NPL). We included eight studies in the review (with a total of 746 patients). It was not possible to combine data from any of the studies, therefore we assessed the individual study results. Five of the studies did not demonstrate any advantage, in terms of reducing pain or discomfort, of using a topical treatment prior to endoscopy. One of these suggested that a vasoconstrictor (xylometazoline) alone reduced the level of ""general unpleasantness"". Two studies did not compare the treatment against placebo or no treatment. A final study actually suggested an increase in pain with the use of topical agents. There may be some unpleasant side effects from the use of topical preparations, such as unpleasant taste. Further standardised research is required.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Anesthesia, Local; *Pharynx; Adult; Endoscopy [*methods]; Fiber Optic Technology; Humans; Laryngoscopy [*methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vasoconstrictor Agents [*administration & dosage]","10.1002/14651858.CD005606.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005606.pub2","ENT"
"CD010714.PUB2","Luo, S-H; Guo, Q; Liu, GJ; Wan, C","Fasting for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2016","Abstract - Background Gastrointestinal bleeding refers to loss of blood from any site of the digestive tract. In paediatric clinical practice, it is usually a complaint of children attending the emergency department as a symptom of diseases such as ulcers, gastric or oesophageal varices, gastritis, Mallory‐Weiss tears, anorectal fissures, allergic colitis, infectious colitis, intussusception, Henoch‐Schonlein purpura, and Meckel's diverticulum; it also occurs with high incidence in critically ill children hospitalised in intensive care units and is caused by stress‐induced gastropathy. No matter what the cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, fasting is believed to be necessary due to the fear that eating may affect haemostasis or aggravate bleeding. Objectives To assess the effects and safety of fasting for haemostasis in gastrointestinal bleeding in children. Search methods We searched EBM Reviews ‐ the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (May 2016), Ovid MEDLINE(R) (1946 to 3 May 2016), EMBASE (1980 to 2016 Week 18), Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1978 to 3 May 2016), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to 3 May 2016), VIP Database (1989 to 4 May 2016) and Wanfang Data (1990 to 4 May 2016). We used no restrictions on language or study setting and limited searches in CNKI and Wanfang Data to the medical field. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs in children with gastrointestinal bleeding that compared fasting with feeding. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the literature search results, and there were no disagreements. Main results We identified no RCTs or quasi‐RCTs that compared the effects and safety of fasting with feeding for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding. No study fulfilled the criteria for considering studies for our review. Authors' conclusions There is currently no information available from RCTs or quasi‐RCTs to support or refute the use of fasting for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding. Plain language summary Fasting for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding Review question To determine the effects and safety of fasting for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding. Background Gastrointestinal bleeding refers to loss of blood from any site of the digestive tract. If the bleeding site is near the ligament of Treitz (the muscle extending from the junction of the duodenum and jejunum to the diaphragm), it is described as upper gastrointestinal bleeding. If the bleeding site is away from the ligament of Treitz, it is described as lower gastrointestinal bleeding. People with a small amount of blood loss may have no symptoms, and have bloody vomiting or see blood in the stool with increased bleeding. Chronic mild gastrointestinal bleeding can lead to anaemia, causing fatigue or pallor; acute massive gastrointestinal bleeding can be life‐threatening. Gastrointestinal bleeding has two scenarios in children. The first is a complaint of attending the emergency department as a symptom of diseases such as ulcers, gastritis, Mallory‐Weiss tears, anorectal fissures, allergic colitis, infectious colitis, intussusception, Henoch‐Schonlein purpura, and Meckel's diverticulum. The second occurs in critically ill children hospitalised in intensive care units and is caused by stress‐induced gastropathy. The incidence of the first scenario has not been well established, but there are substantial cases in paediatric intensive care units in the second scenario. Whatever the cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, fasting is believed to be necessary due to the fear that eating may affect haemostasis or aggravate bleeding. Study characteristics We searched EBM Reviews‐ Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (May 2016), Ovid MEDLINE(R) (1946 to 3 May 2016), EMBASE (1980 to 2016 Week 18), Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1978 to 3 May 2016), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to 3 May 2016), VIP Database (1989 to 4 May 2016) and Wanfang Data (1990 to 4 May 2016). We used no restrictions on language or study setting and limited searches in CNKI and Wanfang Data to medical field. We did not find any randomised controlled trials or quasi‐randomised controlled trials providing information about the effects and safety of fasting for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding.

"CD006968.PUB3","Daly, BJM; Sharif, MO; Jones, K; Worthington, HV; Beattie, A","Local interventions for the management of alveolar osteitis (dry socket)","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2022","Abstract - Background Alveolar osteitis (dry socket) is a complication of dental extractions more often involving mandibular molar teeth. It is associated with severe pain developing 2 to 3 days postoperatively with or without halitosis, a socket that may be partially or totally devoid of a blood clot, and increased postoperative visits. This is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2012.  Objectives To assess the effects of local interventions used for the prevention and treatment of alveolar osteitis (dry socket) following tooth extraction. Search methods An Information Specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 28 September 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of adults over 18 years of age who were having permanent teeth extracted or who had developed dry socket postextraction. We included studies with any type of local intervention used for the prevention or treatment of dry socket, compared to a different local intervention, placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies reporting on systemic use of antibiotics or the use of surgical techniques because these interventions are evaluated in separate Cochrane Reviews. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We followed Cochrane statistical guidelines and reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random‐effects models. For some of the split‐mouth studies with sparse data, it was not possible to calculate RR so we calculated the exact odds ratio (OR) instead. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the body of evidence. Main results We included 49 trials with 6771 participants; 39 trials (with 6219 participants) investigated prevention of dry socket and 10 studies (with 552 participants) looked at the treatment of dry socket. 16 studies were at high risk of bias, 30 studies at unclear risk of bias, and 3 studies at low risk of bias. Chlorhexidine in the prevention of dry socket When compared to placebo, rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthrinses (0.12% and 0.2% concentrations) both before and 24 hours after extraction(s) substantially reduced the risk of developing dry socket with an OR of 0.38 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.58; P < 0.00001; 6 trials, 1547 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The prevalence of dry socket varies from 1% to 5% in routine dental extractions to upwards of 30% in surgically extracted third molars. The number of patients needed to be treated (NNT) with chlorhexidine rinse to prevent one patient having dry socket was 162 (95% CI 155 to 240), 33 (95% CI 27 to 49), and 7 (95% CI 5 to 10) for control prevalence of dry socket 0.01, 0.05, and 0.30 respectively.  Compared to placebo, placing chlorhexidine gel intrasocket after extractions reduced the odds of developing a dry socket by 58% with an OR of 0.44 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.71; P = 0.0008; 7 trials, 753 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The NNT with chlorhexidine gel (0.2%) to prevent one patient developing dry socket was 180 (95% CI 137 to 347), 37 (95% CI 28 to 72), and 7 (95% CI 5 to 15) for control prevalence of dry socket of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.30 respectively. Compared to chlorhexidine rinse (0.12%), placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2%) intrasocket after extractions was not superior in reducing the risk of dry socket (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.20; P = 0.22; 2 trials, 383 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  The present review found some evidence for the association of minor adverse reactions with use of 0.12%, 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthrinses (alteration in taste, staining of teeth, stomatitis) though most studies were not designed explicitly to detect the presence of hypersensitivity reactions to mouthwash as part of the study protocol. No adverse events were reported in relation to the use of 0.2% chlorhexidine gel placed directly into a socket. Platelet rich plasma in the prevention of dry socket  Compared to placebo, placing platelet rich plasma after extractions was not superior in reducing the risk of having a dry socket (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.33; P = 0.17; 2 studies, 127 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).  A further 21 intrasocket interventions to prevent dry socket were each evaluated in single studies, and there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects. Zinc oxide eugenol versus Alvogyl in the treatment of dry socket Two studies, with 80 participants, showed that Alvogyl (old formulation) is more effective than zinc oxide eugenol at reducing pain at day 7 (mean difference (MD) ‐1.40, 95% CI ‐1.75 to ‐1.04; P < 0.00001; 2 studies, 80 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) A further nine interventions for the treatment of dry socket were evaluated in single studies, providing insufficient evidence to determine their effects. Authors' conclusions Tooth extractions are generally undertaken by dentists for a variety of reasons, however, all but five studies included in the present review included participants undergoing extraction of third molars, most of which were undertaken by oral surgeons. There is moderate‐certainty evidence that rinsing with chlorhexidine (0.12% and 0.2%) or placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2%) in the sockets of extracted teeth, probably results in a reduction in dry socket. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of the other 21 preventative interventions each evaluated in single studies. There was limited evidence of very low certainty that Alvogyl (old formulation) may reduce pain at day 7 in patients with dry socket when compared to zinc oxide eugenol.  Plain language summary What treatments can be used to prevent and treat alveolar osteitis (dry socket)?  Key messages ‐ Rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthwash before a dental extraction or beginning 24 hours after may help to prevent a dry socket. ‐ Placing a chlorhexidine gel directly into the socket immediately after tooth extraction may help to prevent a dry socket. ‐ Chlorhexidine rinses cause some minor adverse (unwanted) effects; chlorhexidine intrasocket gels do not appear to cause adverse effects. ‐ Alvogyl reduces the pain of a dry socket when compared to zinc oxide eugenol, but the evidence for this is very uncertain. ‐ Alvogyl does not appear to cause unwanted effects. ‐ We need future studies to strengthen the evidence and investigate the best ways to prevent and treat dry socket in all teeth. What is dry socket? Dry socket is a painful condition that sometimes arises after a tooth has been extracted and is more likely to occur following extraction of wisdom teeth in the lower jaw. What causes dry socket? It is thought to be linked to the loss of some or all of the blood clot that forms at the bottom of a tooth socket after a tooth is taken out. How can we prevent dry socket? An option for prevention of dry socket is to reduce debris and the bacterial load in the mouth, though dry socket is not bacterial in origin. People with poor oral hygiene (food debris and plaque) are at greater risk of dry socket. Improved oral hygiene and rinsing before a dental extraction or beginning 24 hours after may reduce the likelihood of dry socket. How can we treat dry socket ? Options for treating dry socket largely focus on reducing pain locally around the tooth extraction site by placing an obtundent (a soothing medicated dressing). What did we want to find out ? We wanted to find out if antiseptic rinses, gels, or healing patches could help to prevent dry socket. We also wanted to find out if placing a medicated dressing could treat a dry socket and whether any unwanted side effects were produced. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared antiseptic rinses or intrasocket gels with a placebo (dummy) rinse or nothing and a placebo (dummy) intrasocket gel or nothing. To find the best way to treat dry socket we searched for studies that compared different soothing agents with a placebo (dummy) with other soothing agents or with nothing. We compared the results of the studies and summarised the findings. We made an assessment of our confidence in the evidence based on the design of the study and the number of patients recruited. What did we find? We identified 49 trials; 39 trials (6219 participants) investigated prevention of dry socket and 10 trials (552 participants) investigated the treatment of dry socket. We found that: ‐ rinsing both before and after tooth extraction (commencing 24 hours after extraction) with chlorhexidine gluconate rinse (at 0.12% and 0.2% strength) probably results in a reduction in dry socket; ‐ placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2% strength) in the socket of an extracted tooth probably results in a reduction in dry socket; ‐ chlorhexidine rinses and gels are equally effective at reducing dry socket, but the evidence for this comparison is very uncertain; ‐ chlorhexidine rinses produced some minor unwanted effects; chlorhexidine intrasocket gels appeared to produce no unwanted effects; ‐ there was a small amount of evidence of very low certainty from two studies that Alvogyl (old formulation) may reduce pain at day 7 in patients with dry socket when compared to zinc oxide eugenol. This evidence relates to the old formulation of Alvogyl which is no longer available. It should be noted that the formulation of Alvogyl has changed, it is now called Alveogyl.  Tooth extractions are generally undertaken by dentists for a variety of reasons, however, all but five studies included in the present review included participants undergoing extraction of third molars, most of which were undertaken by oral surgeons.  What are the limitations of the evidence? The main limitation of the evidence are that studies: ‐ reported mostly on tooth extractions involving lower wisdom teeth; ‐ were undertaken in ways that introduced errors in the conduct of the study leading to errors in the results; and ‐ produced imprecise results when they were combined. Due to these errors we have some confidence in the results relating to chlorhexidine rinses and gels but further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. How up to date is this evidence?

"CD006140.PUB2","Lobmaier, P; Kornor, H; Kunoe, N; Bjørndal, A","Sustained‐Release Naltrexone For Opioid Dependence","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2008","Abstract - Background Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist which effectively blocks heroin effects. Since opioid dependence treatment with naltrexone tablets suffers from high dropout rates, several depot injections and implants are under investigation. Sustained‐release formulations are claimed to be effective, but a systematic review of the literature is lacking. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of sustained‐release naltrexone for opioid dependence and its adverse effects in different study populations. Search methods The following databases were searched from their inception to November 2007: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, trial database at http://clinicaltrials.gov, available NIDA monographs, CPDD and AAAP conference proceedings. The reference lists of identified studies, published reviews and relevant web sides were searched manually. Study authors and drug companies were contacted to obtain any unpublished material or missing data. Selection criteria To evaluate effectiveness only RCTs were included. To evaluate safety, any clinical trial reporting adverse effects was assessed. Treatment condition was extended to include alcohol dependent subjects and healthy volunteers. Data collection and analysis Reviewers independently evaluated the reports, rated methodological quality and extracted data. Analyses were performed separately for opioid dependent, alcohol dependent and healthy participants. Main results Foe effectiveness, one report met inclusion criteria. Two dosages of naltrexone depot injections (192 and 384 mg) were compared to placebo. High‐dose significantly increased days in treatment compared to placebo (WMD 21.00, 95% CI 10.68 to 31.32, p<0.0001). High‐dose compared to low‐dose significantly increased days in treatment (WMD 12.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 22.31, p=0.02). Number of patients retained in treatment did not show significant differences between groups. For adverse effects, seventeen reports met inclusion criteria analyses, six were RCTs. Side effects were significantly more frequent in naltrexone depot groups compared to placebo. In alcohol dependent samples only, adverse effects appeared to be significantly more frequent in the low‐dose naltrexone depot groups compared to placebo (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.36, p=0.02). In the opioid dependent sample, group differences were not statistically significant. Reports on systematic assessment of side effects and adverse events were scarce. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of sustained‐release naltrexone for treatment of opioid dependence.   For naltrexone injections, administration site‐related adverse effects appear to be frequent, but of moderate intensity and time limited. For a harm‐benefit evaluation of naltrexone implants, more data on side effects and adverse events are needed. Plain language summary People with opioid dependence require substantial therapeutic effort to keep them drug free. Their use of illicit opioids can be reduced and retention in treatment improved with supervised agonist replacement therapy with methadone, which is a highly addictive drug. Naltrexone is a long‐acting, opioid‐antagonist that blocks heroin effects. It is used to prevent relapse of both opioid and alcohol dependence. Highly motivated people do best with   naltrexone. Most opioid users are sceptical about treatment with naltrexone tablets and many drop out early on. Dropouts can be reduced with supervised tablet taking, offering incentives and using sustained‐release naltrexone   such as subcutaneous implants or depot injections.   There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of sustained‐release naltrexone. In the one controlled study that met inclusion criteria, 60 outpatients were randomised to one of three groups that received two sequential depot injections of naltrexone (192 or 384 mg) or placebo injections. The mean dropout time was 48 days with high dose naltrexone compared with 27 days on placebo; an increase in   treatment of 21 days (range 11 to 31 days). The lower depot dose gave a lesser benefit. The number retained in treatment at eight weeks did not show a clear difference and ranged from a mean of 68% to 39% of participants in   the different groups. 'Wanting heroin' did not differ on naltrexone but 'needing heroin' scored significantly lower with depot naltrexone compared to placebo. The most prominent adverse effects were general symptoms of   fatigue and pain at the injection site. Seventeen reports met inclusion criteria for assessing adverse effects. Seven looked specifically at naltrexone implants for treatment of opioid dependence and wound infection, allergic reaction to the implant and number of implants removed. The majority of the trials did not have a control group and systematic assessment of adverse effects was lacking.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Delayed‐Action Preparations; Humans; Naltrexone [*therapeutic use]; Narcotic Antagonists [*therapeutic use]; Opioid‐Related Disorders [*drug therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD006140.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006140.pub2","Drugs and Alcohol"
"CD010218.PUB2","Crowley, AE; Grivell, RM; Dodd, JM","Sealing procedures for preterm prelabour rupture of membranes","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2016","Abstract - Background Preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM) complicates approximately 2% of pregnancies and can be either spontaneous or iatrogenic in nature. Complications of PPROM include prematurity, chorioamnionitis, neonatal sepsis, limb position defects, respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary hypoplasia chronic lung disease, periventricular leukomalacia and intraventricular haemorrhage. A number of different sealing techniques have been employed which aim to restore a physical barrier against infection and encourage the re‐accumulation of amniotic fluid. Routine use of sealants is currently not recommended due to a lack of sufficient evidence to support the safety and effectiveness of such interventions. Objectives To assess the effects of sealing techniques following PPROM against each other, or versus standard care (including no sealant), on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (30 May 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing different techniques for sealing preterm prelabour ruptured membranes. Cluster‐randomised trials and trials using a cross‐over design were not eligible for inclusion in this review. We planned to include abstracts when sufficient information was provided. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed trial quality. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. Main results We included two studies (involving 141 women ‐ with data from 124 women). We considered both studies as being at high risk of bias. Meta‐analysis was not possible because the included studies examined different interventions (both in comparison with standard care) and reported on few, but different, outcomes. One study compared cervical adapter (mechanical sealing), and the other study examined an immunological membrane sealant. Neither of the included studies reported on this review's primary outcome of interest ‐ perinatal mortality. Similarly, data were not reported for the majority of this review's secondary infant and maternal outcomes. Cervical adapter (mechanical sealing) versus standard care (one study, data from 35 participants) No data were reported for this review's primary outcome ‐  perinatal mortality . Data were reported for few of this review's infant or maternal secondary outcomes. There was no clear difference between the mechanical sealing group and the standard care control in relation to the incidence of  neonatal sepsis  (risk ratio (RR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 5.09 ( very low‐quality evidence )) or  chorioamnionitis  (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.28 to 5.09 ( very low‐quality evidence )). Oral immunological membrane sealant versus standard care (one study, data from 94 participants) No data were available for  perinatal mortality  (this review's primary outcome) or for the majority of this review's infant and maternal secondary outcomes. Compared to standard care, the immunological membrane sealant was associated with a reduction in  preterm birth less than 37 weeks  (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.68 ( very low‐quality evidence )) and a reduction in  neonatal death  (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.75 ( very low‐quality evidence) ). However, there was no clear difference between groups in terms of  neonatal sepsis  (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.46 ( very low‐quality evidence )) or  respiratory distress syndrome  (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.46 ( very low‐quality evidence )). Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to evaluate sealing procedures for PPROM. There were no data relating to this review's primary outcome (perinatal mortality) and the majority of our infant and maternal secondary outcomes were not reported in the two included studies. There was limited evidence to suggest that an immunological membrane sealant was associated with a reduction in preterm birth at less than 37 weeks and neonatal death, but these results should be interpreted with caution as this is based on one small study, with a high risk of bias, and the intervention has not been tested in other studies. Although midtrimester PPROM is not a rare occurrence, there are only a small amount of published data addressing the benefits and risks of sealing procedures. Most of these studies are retrospective and cohort based and could therefore not be included in our data‐analysis. This review highlights the paucity of prospective randomised trials in this area. Current evidence provides limited information both on effectiveness and safety for the interventions described. Given the paucity of high‐quality data, we recommend that future research efforts focus on the conduct of randomised trials assessing the effect of promising interventions that have been only evaluated to date in cohort studies (e.g. amniopatch). Future trials should address outcomes including perinatal mortality, preterm birth, neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal sepsis and developmental delay. They should also evaluate maternal outcomes including sepsis, mode of delivery, length of hospital stay and emotional well‐being. Plain language summary Treatments for improving outcomes for mother and baby when the waters have broken too early What is the issue? Preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM) is when the waters break at less than 37 weeks' gestation. It occurs in one in 50 pregnancies and can happen spontaneously or after a medical procedure has been performed, for example, tests where a needle is placed in to the womb to get a sample of fluid or tissue, or after an operation has been performed on the baby inside the womb. Why is this important? Breaking of the waters early in pregnancy can lead to significant problems including the baby being born too soon to survive, having immature lungs, and serious infections. Preterm babies are overall more likely to be ill and to suffer from long‐term disabilities, if they do survive. The survival of babies affected by PPROM is related to how early it occurs in the pregnancy and if an infection occurs. In some circumstances, the waters may reseal themselves. This is more likely to occur when no infection is present. Several treatments to reseal the membranes have been tried, with varying success. Resealing has been attempted by: a) injecting clotting factors and other medicines in to the hole in the womb to create a patch over the area that is leaking; b) taking tablets that may stimulate the body’s immune system to mend the area where the seal has broken; c) placing a sponge over the hole in the waters; d) placing a seal over the neck of the womb to stop fluid leaking out and prevent infection. Our study is important because finding a successful treatment for PPROM may reduce the potential complications that may happen to the mother and baby such as preterm birth (being born before 37 weeks' gestation) and infections. What did we find? In our study we assessed the different techniques used for resealing the waters. We aimed to compare the survival of babies affected with this condition before and after birth and look at the rates of complications in both the babies and mothers. We searched for trials (30 May 2016) and found two studies that compared treatments for resealing the membranes after they had broken. These trials involved 141 women in total and compared two completely different modes of treatment. One trial compared the use of an oral immunological membrane sealant to stimulate the body’s immune system to mend the area where the seal has broken and the other trial placed a mechanical sealing device over the cervix (neck of the womb) to stop fluid leaking. Unfortunately, neither trial provided any data relating to death of the baby within the womb or in the first 28 days of life (perinatal mortality). There was limited evidence to suggest that oral immunological membrane sealant was associated with a fewer babies being before 37 weeks’ gestation and a reduction in the number of babies that died within the first 28 days. However, these results are based on  very low‐quality evidence  from one small trial (with data from 94 women) that we judged to be at a high risk of bias. There was no clear difference between the mechanical sealing device group and the control group in relation to the number of babies who contracted a serious infection (neonatal sepsis) or chorioamnionitis (a bacterial infection that causes inflammation of the membranes surrounding the baby in the womb). Although these results are based on  very low‐quality evidence  from one small trial (involving 35 women) judged to be at a high risk of bias. What does this mean? Overall, our question remains unanswered ‐ we do not have enough data to fully evaluate sealing procedures for PPROM. This review demonstrates the lack of research in this area regarding the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments for PPROM. We recommend that more research is needed to look at the different techniques for sealing broken waters and that this research should focus on the effectiveness of the treatment in improving overall outcomes. The safety of the treatments to both mother and baby must be further evaluated before sealing techniques can be recommended to prevent adverse outcomes.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Obstetric Labor, Premature; Equipment Design; Female; Fetal Membranes, Premature Rupture [*therapy]; Humans; Immunologic Factors [*therapeutic use]; Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy [*instrumentation, methods]; Pregnancy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD010218.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010218.pub2","Pregnancy and Childbirth"
"CD006087.PUB3","Nasser, M; Pandis, N; Fleming, PS; Fedorowicz, Z; Ellis, E; Ali, K","Interventions for the management of mandibular fractures","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2013","Abstract - Background Fractures of the mandible (lower jaw) are a common occurrence and usually related to interpersonal violence or road traffic accidents. Mandibular fractures may be treated using open (surgical) and closed (non‐surgical) techniques. Fracture sites are immobilized with intermaxillary fixation (IMF) or other external or internal devices (i.e. plates and screws) to allow bone healing. Various techniques have been used, however uncertainty exists with respect to the specific indications for each approach. Objectives The objective of this review is to provide reliable evidence of the effects of any interventions either open (surgical) or closed (non‐surgical) that can be used in the management of mandibular fractures, excluding the condyles, in adult patients. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 28 February 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 28 February 2013), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 28 February 2013),  meta Register of Controlled Trials (to 7 April 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (to 7 April 2013) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 7 April 2013). The reference lists of all trials identified were checked for further studies. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials evaluating the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. Any studies that compared different treatment approaches were included. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Results were to be expressed as random‐effects models using mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was to be investigated to include both clinical and methodological factors. Main results Twelve studies, assessed as high (six) and unclear (six) risk of bias, comprising 689 participants (830 fractures), were included. Interventions examined different plate materials and morphology; use of one or two lag screws; microplate versus miniplate; early and delayed mobilization; eyelet wires versus Rapid IMF™ and the management of angle fractures with intraoral access alone or combined with a transbuccal approach. Patient‐oriented outcomes were largely ignored and post‐operative pain scores were inadequately reported. Unfortunately, only one or two trials with small sample sizes were conducted for each comparison and outcome. Our results and conclusions should therefore be interpreted with caution. We were able to pool the results for two comparisons assessing one outcome. Pooled data from two studies comparing two miniplates versus one miniplate revealed no significant difference in the risk of post‐operative infection of surgical site (risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95% CI 0.41 to 4.22, P = 0.64, I 2  = 0%). Similarly, no difference in post‐operative infection between the use of two 3‐dimensional (3D) and standard (2D) miniplates was determined (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.19 to 8.13, P = 0.81, I 2  = 27%). The included studies involved a small number of participants with a low number of events. Authors' conclusions This review illustrates that there is currently inadequate evidence to support the effectiveness of a single approach in the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. The lack of high quality evidence may be explained by clinical diversity, variability in assessment tools used and difficulty in grading outcomes with existing measurement tools. Until high level evidence is available, treatment decisions should continue to be based on the clinician's prior experience and the individual circumstances. Plain language summary Treatments for fractures of the lower jaw Review question The lower jaw (also known as the mandible) is an important bone that shapes the face, holds the lower teeth in place and is used to move the mouth, for talking and chewing food. Fractures are most often found in the part of the lower jaw that supports teeth (known as the body), the part where the jaw curves upwards into the neck (the angle), or at the knobbly‐shaped joint found at the very top of the jaw bone (the condyle). Available treatments align and stabilize the fracture, allowing the bone to heal in the proper position. Treatments may or may not involve surgery. This review, produced by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, examines different methods for treating fractures of the body and angle of the mandible in existing research and studies. Background People of all ages can fracture their lower jaw, but fractures mainly occur as a result of violence (for example, being hit or punched in the jaw) or by being involved in an accident on the road (for example, car crashes or bicycle accidents). These fractures can be stabilized by physically binding the jaw shut with a system of bars, wires or elastic bands (intermaxillary fixation), or by using tiny screws or plates attached directly to the fractured sections of the lower jaw bone whilst still allowing the mouth to open (rigid fixation). Study characteristics The evidence on which this review is based is up to date as of 28 February 2013. Twelve studies with a combined total of 689 participants were included in this review. Participants ranged in age from 16 to 68 years and most participants (90%) were male. All of the studies compared different types of surgical treatments, and each study evaluated a different aspect of surgical treatment such as different types of plates, screws, or wires or how long the jaw was immobilized after surgery. Key results There were concerns about the design and quality of all the studies. All the studies evaluated different aspects of surgical treatment. None of the studies evaluated non‐surgical treatments such as intermaxillary fixation and no study compared surgical treatment with non‐surgical treatment. As a result there is no clear evidence to indicate which approach is the best to manage these fractures. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence found is poor. Recommendations are made for further well‐conducted research studies in this area to be undertaken.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Atrophy; Fracture Fixation [instrumentation, *methods]; Humans; Mandibular Fractures [*therapy]; Middle Aged; Mouth, Edentulous [*complications]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD006087.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006087.pub3","Oral Health"
"CD006214.PUB5","Smith, F; Donaldson, J; Brown, T","Debridement for surgical wounds","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2024","Abstract - Background Surgical wounds that become infected are often debrided because clinicians believe that removal of this necrotic or infected tissue may expedite wound healing. There are numerous methods of debridement available, but no consensus on which one is most effective for surgical wounds. Objectives To assess the effects of different methods of debridement on the rate of debridement and healing of surgical wounds. Search methods In October 2021, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. To identify additional studies, we searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies, reviews, meta‐analyses, and health technology reports. There were no restrictions on language, date of publication, or study setting. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people with a surgical wound that required debridement, and reported time to complete wound debridement or time to wound healing, or both. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment using the RoB 1 tool, data extraction, and GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence. Main results In this fourth update, we identified one additional study for inclusion. The review now includes six studies, with 265 participants, aged three to 91 years. Five studies were published between 1979 and 1990 and one published in 2014. The studies were carried out in hospital settings in China, Denmark, Belgium, and the UK. Six studies provided six comparisons. Due to the heterogeneity of studies, it was not appropriate to conduct meta‐analyses. Four studies evaluated the effectiveness of dextranomer beads/paste; however, each study used a different comparator (Eusol‐soaked dressings, 10% aqueous polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% chloramine‐soaked packs, and silicone foam elastomer dressing). One study compared streptokinase/streptodornase with saline‐soaked dressings, and one compared endoscopic surgical debridement with conventional 'open' surgical debridement. Five studies reported time to complete debridement (reported as time to a clean wound bed) and three reported time to complete healing. One study reported effect estimates (surgical debridement via endoscopy versus surgical debridement) for time to a clean wound bed and time to complete wound healing, and it was possible to calculate effect estimates for one other study (dextranomer paste versus silicone foam elastomer) for time to complete wound healing. For the other four studies that did not report effect estimates, it was not possible to calculate time to a clean wound bed or time to complete wound healing due to missing variance and participant exclusions. None of the included studies reported outcomes pertaining to proportion of wounds completely healed, rate of reduction in wound size, rate of infection, or quality of life. All studies had unclear or high risk of bias for at least one key domain. Dextranomer paste/beads (autolytic debridement) compared with four different comparators Four studies compared dextranomer paste or beads with Eusol‐soaked gauze (20 participants), 10% aqueous polyvinylpyrrolidone (40 participants), 0.1% chloramine‐soaked dressings (28 participants), or silicone foam elastomer (50 participants). There is very low‐certainty evidence that there may be no clear difference in time to a clean wound bed between dextranomer beads and Eusol gauze. The study did not report adverse events. There is very low‐certainty evidence that there may be no difference in time to a clean wound bed between dextranomer paste and 10% aqueous polyvinylpyrrolidone gauze. There was low‐certainty evidence that there may be no difference in deaths and serious adverse events. There may be a difference in time until the wounds were clinically clean and time to complete wound healing between dextranomer paste and 0.1% chloramine favouring 0.1% chloramine, but we are very uncertain. There is low‐certainty evidence that there may be no difference in deaths and serious adverse events. There is very low‐certainty evidence that there may be no difference in time to complete healing between dextranomer beads and silicone foam elastomer. The study did not report adverse events. Streptokinase/streptodornase solution (enzymatic) compared with saline‐soaked dressings One study (21 participants) compared enzymatic debridement with saline‐soaked dressings. There is low‐certainty evidence that there may be no difference in time to a clean wound bed or secondary suture between streptokinase/streptodornase and saline‐soaked dressings. There is very low‐certainty evidence that there may be no difference in deaths and serious adverse events. Surgical debridement via endoscopic ('keyhole') surgery compared with surgical debridement by 'open' surgery (the wound is opened using a scalpel) One study (106 participants) reported time to complete wound healing and time to a clean wound bed. There is low‐certainty evidence that there may be a reduction in time to complete wound healing and very low‐certainty evidence that there may be no difference in time to a clean wound bed with surgical debridement via endoscopy compared to 'open' surgical debridement. The study did not report adverse events. Overall, the evidence was low to very low‐certainty for all outcomes. Five included studies were published before 1991 and investigated treatments that are no longer available. Worldwide production of dextranomer products has been discontinued, except for dextranomer paste, which is currently only available in South Africa. Furthermore, Eusol, used in one study as the comparator to dextranomer, is rarely used due to risk of harmful effects on healthy tissue and the enzymatic agent streptokinase/streptodornase is no longer available worldwide. Authors' conclusions Evidence for the effects of different methods of debridement on complete wound debridement and healing of surgical wounds remains unclear. Adequately powered, methodologically robust RCTs evaluating contemporary debridement interventions for surgical wounds are needed to guide clinical decision‐making. Plain language summary Is there a best way to remove dead tissue from surgical wounds? Key message We cannot be certain whether removal of dead or infected tissue of surgical wounds or care that is usually provided makes any difference to how long it takes to remove all of the dead tissue from the wound and for the wound to heal. What did we want to find out? Following surgery, most surgical wounds heal naturally with no complications. However, complications such as infection can occur, which may result in delayed healing. There are many different methods of removing dead or infected tissue (called debridement), such as surgical removal of the tissue, enzymes (naturally occurring proteins that dissolve the tissue), and mechanical methods (for example, a special dry gauze that is removed when the tissue has stuck to it). We wanted to look at the different ways to remove dead or infected tissue from wounds after surgical operations and find out how they affect the time it takes to remove all of the dead tissue from the wound and for the wound to heal. What did we do? We searched medical databases for well‐designed studies including people of any age that compared one method of debridement versus a dummy treatment (placebo), no treatment, or another method of debridement after surgery. What did we find? We found six studies dating from 1979 to 2014 that compared different types of wound debridement with the way care was usually provided for wounds that had dead tissue within them after surgery. All six studies compared different types of debridement methods or different types of usual care, meaning we could not combine the results. The total number of participants within the studies was 265, and ages of participants ranged from three to 91 years. The studies were carried out in hospitals in China, Denmark, Belgium, and the UK. Four studies compared a treatment method that promotes the body's natural wound healing process (called autolytic) with different types of usual care. Overall, we found that this method may make little or no difference to how long it takes to remove all of the dead tissue. One study compared an enzyme with usual care, and we found that this method may make little or no difference to how long it takes to remove all of the dead tissue. One study compared different methods of removing dead tissue using surgery (one via 'keyhole' surgery, the other 'normal' surgery). We found that using keyhole surgery to remove the dead tissue may have little or no effect on time for the wound to heal, but we are very uncertain about the results. Only three of the studies (two autolytic and one using an enzyme) reported serious harmful events that led to discontinuation of treatment or hospital admission. There may be no difference in deaths and serious harmful events between the treatment methods. Overall, all the studies indicated that it is unclear whether any type of wound debridement is better than usual care at reducing time to remove all of the dead tissue, time to complete healing, serious harmful events that led to discontinuation of treatment, or hospital admission. What are the limitations of the evidence? Overall, we are very uncertain about the evidence, mainly because the studies had small numbers of people, and did not report the results well. Additionally, five studies used debridement products that are no longer used clinically. How up to date is the evidence? We searched for studies published up to October 2021.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Debridement [methods]; *Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; *Surgical Wound Infection; *Wound Healing; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bandages; Bias; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Middle Aged; Surgical Wound [therapy]; Time Factors; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD006214.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006214.pub5","Wounds"

Previous trials and meta‐analyses have led to different conclusions on whether a high fraction of supplemental inspired oxygen during anaesthesia may decrease or increase mortality and surgical site infections in surgical patients. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of an FIO 2  equal to or greater than 60% compared with a control FIO 2  at or below 40% in the perioperative setting in terms of mortality, surgical site infection, respiratory insufficiency, serious adverse events and length of stay during the index admission for adult surgical patients. We looked at various outcomes, conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses, examined the role of bias and applied trial sequential analysis (TSA) to examine the level of evidence supporting or refuting a high FIO 2  during surgery, anaesthesia and recovery. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, International Web of Science, the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), advanced Google and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) up to February 2014. We checked the references of included trials and reviews for unidentified relevant trials and reran the searches in March 2015. We will consider two studies of interest when we update the review. Selection criteria We included randomized clinical trials that compared a high fraction of inspired oxygen with a routine fraction of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia, surgery and recovery in individuals 18 years of age or older. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data independently. We conducted random‐effects and fixed‐effect meta‐analyses, and for dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs). We used published data and data obtained by contacting trial authors. To minimize the risk of systematic error, we assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. To reduce the risk of random errors caused by sparse data and repetitive updating of cumulative meta‐analyses, we applied trial sequential analyses. We used Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results We included 28 randomized clinical trials (9330 participants); in the 21 trials reporting relevant outcomes for this review, 7597 participants were randomly assigned to a high fraction of inspired oxygen versus a routine fraction of inspired oxygen. In trials with an overall low risk of bias, a high fraction of inspired oxygen compared with a routine fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with all‐cause mortality (random‐effects model: RR 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.36; GRADE: low quality) within the longest follow‐up and within 30 days of follow‐up (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.99, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.60; GRADE: low quality). In a trial sequential analysis, the required information size was not reached and the analysis could not refute a 20% increase in mortality. Similarly, when all trials were included, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with all���cause mortality to the longest follow‐up (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.33) or within 30 days of follow‐up (Peto OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.29), both of very low quality according to GRADE. Neither was a high fraction of inspired oxygen associated with the risk of surgical site infection in trials with low risk of bias (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.17; GRADE: low quality) or in all trials (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07; GRADE: low quality). A high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with respiratory insufficiency (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.99), serious adverse events (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43) or length of stay (mean difference ‐0.06 days, 95% CI ‐0.44 to 0.32 days). In subgroup analyses of nine trials using preoperative antibiotics, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was associated with a decrease in surgical site infections (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97; GRADE: very low quality); a similar effect was noted in the five trials adequately blinded for the outcome assessment (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; GRADE: very low quality). We did not observe an effect of a high fraction of inspired oxygen on surgical site infections in any other subgroup analyses. Authors' conclusions As the risk of adverse events, including mortality, may be increased by a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60% or higher, and as robust evidence is lacking for a beneficial effect of a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60% or higher on surgical site infection, our overall results suggest that evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of a high fraction of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia and surgery. Given the risk of attrition and outcome reporting bias, as well as other weaknesses in the available evidence, further randomized clinical trials with low risk of bias in all bias domains, including a large sample size and long‐term follow‐up, are warranted. Plain language summary The effects of giving adult patients a high inspiratory oxygen fraction around the time of surgery Review question The normal air that we breathe contains 21% oxygen. This systematic review assesses the beneficial and harmful effects of a percentage of inspired oxygen of 60% to 90% compared with a routine percentage of 30% to 40% given during anaesthesia, during surgery and in the immediate recovery period on the numbers of deaths and surgical site infections reported in adult surgical patients. Background Reduced lung and circulatory function during surgery can lead to reduced levels of oxygen (hypoxia). Also, oxygen levels are often low in wounds at the end of surgery. This may impair bacterial killing and wound healing. Trials and previous meta‐analyses have led to different conclusions as to whether a high percentage of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia may decrease or increase the risk of death or surgical site infections. This systematic review used improved Cochrane methodology for carrying out systematic reviews to reassess available evidence derived from randomized clinical trials. Study characteristics We identified 28 randomized clinical trials. Eight trials with 4918 participants reported on risk of death, and 15 trials with 7219 participants reported on surgical site infections within 14 to 30 days of surgery. Four trials reported serious adverse events, three trials respiratory insufficiency, nine trials length of stay during the associated hospital admission and one trial quality of life. All trials were conducted without direct industry funding. The number of participants in each trial ranged from 38 to 2012. The mean age of participants was 50 years (range 15 to 92 years) and 63% were women. Types of surgery included abdominal surgery (eight trials), caesarean section (four trials), breast surgery (one trial), orthopaedic surgery (two trials) and various other surgical procedures (four trials). Key results A high percentage of inspired oxygen was not statistically associated with increased risk of death, or with a decrease in surgical site infections, in all trials that measured these outcomes, in trials of highest quality and in those with longest follow‐up. An increased risk of adverse events could not be proved right or wrong for a high percentage of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia and surgery. Quality and quantity of the evidence Only five of the included trials had low risk of bias. The trials randomly assigned 9330 participants, of whom only 7537 participants provided data for this review. The number of participants required to detect or reject a 20% relative risk reduction in deaths was not reached; therefore the observed results were uncertain.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adult; Aged; Anesthesia; Cause of Death; Humans; Length of Stay; Middle Aged; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy [*adverse effects, methods, mortality]; Oxygen [*administration & dosage, *adverse effects]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Insufficiency [*etiology]; Selection Bias; Surgical Procedures, Operative [*mortality]; Surgical Wound Infection [*etiology]","10.1002/14651858.CD008884.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008884.pub2","Anaesthesia"

Although there are many kinds of interventions, the optimal one for the palliation of dysphagia remains unclear. This review updates the previous version published in 2009. Objectives The aim of this review was to systematically analyse and summarise the efficacy of different interventions used in the palliation of dysphagia in primary oesophageal and gastro‐oesophageal carcinoma. Search methods To find new studies for this updated review, in January 2014 we searched, according to the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases model, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library ), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL; and major conference proceedings (up to January 2014).   Selection criteria Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in which patients with inoperable or unresectable primary oesophageal cancer underwent palliative treatment. Different interventions like rigid plastic intubation, self‐expanding metallic stent (SEMS) insertion, brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy, chemotherapy, oesophageal bypass surgery, chemical and thermal ablation therapy, either head‐to‐head or in combination, were included. The primary outcome was dysphagia improvement. Secondary outcomes included recurrent dysphagia, technical success, procedure related mortality, 30‐day mortality, adverse effects and quality of life. Data collection and analysis Data collection and analysis were performed in accordance with the methods of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Review Group. Main results We included 3684 patients from 53 studies. SEMS insertion was safer and more effective than plastic tube insertion. Thermal and chemical ablative therapy provided comparable dysphagia palliation but had an increased requirement for re‐interventions and for adverse effects. Anti‐reflux stents provided comparable dysphagia palliation to conventional metal stents. Some anti‐reflux stents might have reduced gastro‐oesophageal reflux and complications. Newly‐designed double‐layered nitinol (Niti‐S) stents were preferable due to longer survival time and fewer complications compared to simple Niti‐S stents. Brachytherapy might be a suitable alternative to SEMS in providing a survival advantage and possibly a better quality of life, and might provide better results when combined with argon plasma coagulation or external beam radiation therapy. Authors' conclusions Self‐expanding metal stent insertion is safe, effective and quicker in palliating dysphagia compared to other modalities. However, high‐dose intraluminal brachytherapy is a suitable alternative and might provide additional survival benefit with a better quality of life. Some anti‐reflux stents and newly‐designed stents lead to longer survival and fewer complications compared to conventional stents. Combinations of brachytherapy with self‐expanding metal stent insertion or radiotherapy are preferable due to the reduced requirement for re‐interventions. Rigid plastic tube insertion, dilatation alone or in combination with other modalities, and chemotherapy alone are not recommended for palliation of dysphagia due to a high incidence of delayed complications and recurrent dysphagia. Plain language summary Interventions for reducing difficulty in swallowing in people with oesophageal cancer Review question For most patients with unresectable or inoperable oesophageal cancer, providing clinical benefit with palliative treatment is highly desirable. However, the optimal palliative technique for dysphagia improvement and better quality of life is not established. Background Dysphagia (difficulty or discomfort in swallowing) is common among patients with unresectable or inoperable oesophageal cancer. There are five levels of dysphagia, ranging from the ability to eat a normal diet to some solids, semisolids, liquids and to complete dysphagia. Study characteristics The review included randomised controlled studies comparing the use of different interventions to improve dysphagia among patients with inoperable or unresectable primary oesophageal cancer. To find new studies for this updated review, in January 2014 we searched, according to the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases model, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library ), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL; and major conference proceedings (up to January 2014). Key results The review updates the previous version but still fails to present any obvious superiority of one technique over another among the different kinds of interventions. Self‐expanding metal stents provided safer and more effective relief of dysphagia compared to rigid plastic stents. Other techniques like radiotherapy or brachytherapy were also suitable alternatives and might be favourable in improving quality of life and prolonging survival. Individual differences should be emphasised when the intervention type was determined. Quality of the evidence Half of the studies included in this review were of high quality. Most studies did not state the methods used to seek and report quality of life outcomes and adverse effects.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adenocarcinoma [*complications]; Brachytherapy [methods, mortality]; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell [*complications]; Deglutition Disorders [mortality, *therapy]; Esophageal Neoplasms [*complications]; Gastroesophageal Reflux [therapy]; Humans; Laser Therapy [methods]; Palliative Care [*methods]; Photochemotherapy; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recurrence; Stents [adverse effects]","10.1002/14651858.CD005048.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005048.pub4","Gut"

As a clinicopathologic disorder, a diagnosis of EoE requires a constellation of clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and histologic findings (at least 15 eosinophils/high‐powered microscope field (eos/hpf)). Current guidelines no longer require the failure of response to proton pump inhibitor medications to establish a diagnosis of EoE, but continue to suggest the exclusion of other etiologies of esophageal eosinophilia. The treatment goals for EoE are improvement in clinical symptoms, resolution of esophageal eosinophilia and other histologic abnormalities, endoscopic improvement, improved quality of life, improved esophageal function, minimized adverse effects of treatment, and prevention of disease progression and subsequent complications. Currently, there is no cure for EoE, making long‐term treatment necessary. Standard treatment modalities include dietary modifications, esophageal dilation, and pharmacologic therapy. Effective pharmacologic therapies include corticosteroids, rapidly emerging biological therapies, and proton pump inhibitor medications. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of medical interventions for people with eosinophilic esophagitis. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP to 3 March 2023. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any medical intervention or food elimination diet for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis, either alone or in combination, to any other intervention (including placebo). Data collection and analysis Pairs of review authors independently selected studies and conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We expressed outcomes as a risk ratio (RR) and as the mean or standardized mean difference (MD/SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Our primary outcomes were: clinical, histological, and endoscopic improvement, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Secondary outcomes were: serious and total adverse events, and quality of life. Main results We included 41 RCTs with 3253 participants. Eleven studies included pediatric patients while the rest recruited both children and adults. Four studies were in patients with inactive disease while the rest were in patients with active disease. We identified 19 intervention comparisons. In this abstract we present the results of the primary outcomes for the two main comparisons: corticosteroids versus placebo and biologics versus placebo, based on the prespecified outcomes defined of the primary studies. Fourteen studies compared corticosteroids to placebo for induction of remission and the risk of bias for these studies was mostly low. Corticosteroids may lead to slightly better clinical improvement (20% higher), measured dichotomously (risk ratio (RR) 1.74, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.80; 6 studies, 583 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 4; low certainty), and may lead to slightly better clinical improvement, measured continuously (standard mean difference (SMD) 0.51, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.85; 5 studies, 475 participants; low certainty). Corticosteroids lead to a large histological improvement (63% higher), measured dichotomously (RR 11.94, 95% CI 6.56 to 21.75; 12 studies, 978 participants; NNTB = 3; high certainty), and may lead to histological improvement, measured continuously (SMD 1.42, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.82; 5 studies, 449 participants; low certainty). Corticosteroids may lead to little to no endoscopic improvement, measured dichotomously (RR 2.60, 95% CI 0.82 to 8.19; 5 studies, 596 participants; low certainty), and may lead to endoscopic improvement, measured continuously (SMD 1.33, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.08; 5 studies, 596 participants; low certainty). Corticosteroids may lead to slightly fewer withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.96; 14 studies, 1032 participants; low certainty). Nine studies compared biologics to placebo for induction of remission. Biologics may result in little to no difference in clinical improvement, measured dichotomously (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.52; 5 studies, 410 participants; low certainty), and may result in better clinical improvement, measured continuously (SMD 0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.78; 7 studies, 387 participants; moderate certainty). Biologics result in better histological improvement (55% higher), measured dichotomously (RR 6.73, 95% CI 2.58 to 17.52; 8 studies, 925 participants; NNTB = 2; moderate certainty). We could not draw conclusions for this outcome when measured continuously (SMD 1.01, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.66; 6 studies, 370 participants; very low certainty). Biologics may result in little to no difference in endoscopic improvement, measured dichotomously (effect not estimable, low certainty). We cannot draw conclusions for this outcome when measured continuously (SMD 2.79, 95% CI 0.36 to 5.22; 1 study, 11 participants; very low certainty). There may be no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.74; 8 studies, 792 participants; low certainty). Authors' conclusions Corticosteroids (as compared to placebo) may lead to clinical symptom improvement when reported both as dichotomous and continuous outcomes, from the primary study definitions. Corticosteroids lead to a large increase in histological improvement (dichotomous outcome) and may increase histological improvement (continuous outcome) when compared to placebo. Corticosteroids may or may not increase endoscopic improvement (depending on whether the outcome is measured dichotomously or continuously). Withdrawals due to adverse events (dichotomous outcome) may occur less frequently when corticosteroids are compared to placebo. Biologics (as compared to placebo) may not lead to clinical symptom improvement when reported as a dichotomous outcome and may lead to an increase in clinical symptom improvement (as a continuous outcome), from the primary study definitions. Biologics lead to a large increase in histological improvement when reported as a dichotomous outcome, but this is uncertain when reported as a continuous outcome, as compared to placebo. Biologics may not increase endoscopic improvement (dichotomous outcome), but this is uncertain when measured as a continuous outcome. Withdrawals due to adverse events as a dichotomous outcome may occur as frequently when biologics are compared to placebo. Plain language summary Medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis Key messages We found that while corticosteroids may improve patients' symptoms, they certainly reduce the amount of allergic cells (eosinophils) and they may improve what the disease looks like under visual inspection (endoscopy), when compared to placebo, for children and adults with eosinophilic esophagitis. They may be just as safe as a placebo (dummy treatment). We found that biologics (a type of treatment that uses substances made from living organisms to treat disease) may improve patients' symptoms, that they certainly reduce the amount of allergic cells, and that they may be no different in terms of what the disease looks like under visual inspection, when compared to placebo, for children and adults with eosinophilic esophagitis. They may be just as safe as a placebo. What is eosinophilic esophagitis? Eosinophilic esophagitis is a long‐term allergic condition in which the esophagus becomes inflamed (sore), which can lead to difficulty swallowing, vomiting, heartburn, and chest and stomach pain. Particles in foods or the air cause the immune system to have an allergic reaction and produce immune cells, which are called eosinophils. These build up in the esophagus, the tube that connects the mouth with the stomach. Eosinophilic esophagitis was first identified in the 1990s and since then it has been recognized as a major digestive illness. It is not known what causes it, but it might be related to genetics combined with environmental triggers. People with eosinophilic esophagitis tend to have other allergies as well. Currently, there is no cure for eosinophilic esophagitis, making long‐term treatment necessary. Standard treatments include diets, stretching of the esophagus (dilation), and drugs such as corticosteroids, biological medications, and proton pump inhibitor medications. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if the available medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis work for improving patients' symptoms, reducing the amount of allergic cells when measured under a microscope, and improving what the disease looks like under visual examination. We also wanted to find out how safe they are and if they improve quality of life. What did we do? We searched for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing any medical treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis with any other medical treatment, in both adults and children.   What did we find? We found 41 studies with 3253 participants. Eleven studies were in children only while the rest were in a mix of children and adults. We identified 19 comparisons. In this summary, we present the results of the two main comparisons: corticosteroids compared to placebo and biologics compared to placebo. We found that corticosteroids may be better than placebo at improving patients' symptoms. We are highly certain that corticosteroids are better than placebo at reducing the amount of eosinophils (allergic cells) when measured under a microscope. Corticosteroids may be better than placebo at improving what the disease looks like under visual examination (endoscopy). We also found that people taking corticosteroids may be less likely to leave a study due to unwanted or harmful effects (side effects), and that they probably experience a similar number of both serious side effects and side effects in total, compared to placebo. There may be no difference between corticosteroids and placebo in the improvement of quality of life. We found that biologics may be better than placebo at improving patients' symptoms. It is likely that biologics are better than placebo at reducing the amount of allergic cells when measured under a microscope. Biologics may be no different to placebo at improving what the disease looks like under visual examination. We also found that people on biologics may be equally likely to leave a study due to side effects, or have serious side effects, and may experience similar numbers of total side effects, compared to placebo. There may be no difference between biologics and placebo in the improvement of quality of life. What are the limitations of the evidence? The evidence in children only was quite limited and we do not know if the conclusions above can definitely apply to children specifically. Another limitation of the evidence is that the outcomes were measured in many different ways, which may have weakened our conclusions. Other treatments used by the participants were also something that varied a lot between people, and may have affected our conclusions. Finally, we were limited in the conclusions we could make about the effects of sex, age, extent of disease, dosage, and type of corticosteroid or biologic. How up‐to‐date is this review?

They can be associated with an impaired skin barrier in early infancy. It is unclear whether trying to prevent or reverse an impaired skin barrier soon after birth is effective for preventing eczema or food allergy. Objectives Primary objective To assess the effects of skin care interventions such as emollients for primary prevention of eczema and food allergy in infants. Secondary objective To identify features of study populations such as age, hereditary risk, and adherence to interventions that are associated with the greatest treatment benefit or harm for both eczema and food allergy. Search methods We performed an updated search of the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in September 2021. We searched two trials registers in July 2021. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and scanned conference proceedings to identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).  Selection criteria We included RCTs of skin care interventions that could potentially enhance skin barrier function, reduce dryness, or reduce subclinical inflammation in healthy term (> 37 weeks) infants (≤ 12 months) without pre‐existing eczema, food allergy, or other skin condition. Eligible comparisons were standard care in the locality or no treatment. Types of skin care interventions could include moisturisers/emollients; bathing products; advice regarding reducing soap exposure and bathing frequency; and use of water softeners. No minimum follow‐up was required. Data collection and analysis This is a prospective individual participant data (IPD) meta‐analysis. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, and primary analyses used the IPD dataset. Primary outcomes were cumulative incidence of eczema and cumulative incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig)E‐mediated food allergy by one to three years, both measured at the closest available time point to two years. Secondary outcomes included adverse events during the intervention period; eczema severity (clinician‐assessed); parent report of eczema severity; time to onset of eczema; parent report of immediate food allergy; and allergic sensitisation to food or inhalant allergen. Main results We identified 33 RCTs comprising 25,827 participants. Of these, 17 studies randomising 5823 participants reported information on one or more outcomes specified in this review.  We included 11 studies, randomising 5217 participants, in one or more meta‐analyses (range 2 to 9 studies per individual meta‐analysis), with 10 of these studies providing IPD; the remaining 6 studies were included in the narrative results only.   Most studies were conducted at children's hospitals. Twenty‐five studies, including all those contributing data to meta‐analyses, randomised newborns up to age three weeks to receive a skin care intervention or standard infant skin care. Eight of the 11 studies contributing to meta‐analyses recruited infants at high risk of developing eczema or food allergy, although the definition of high risk varied between studies. Durations of intervention and follow‐up ranged from 24 hours to three years. All interventions were compared against no skin care intervention or local standard care. Of the 17 studies that reported information on our prespecified outcomes, 13 assessed emollients. We assessed most of the evidence in the review as low certainty and had some concerns about risk of bias. A rating of some concerns was most often due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors or significant missing data, which could have impacted outcome measurement but was judged unlikely to have done so. We assessed the evidence for the primary food allergy outcome as high risk of bias due to the inclusion of only one trial, where findings varied based on different assumptions about missing data. Skin care interventions during infancy probably do not change the risk of eczema by one to three years of age (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.31; risk difference 5 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI 28 less to 47 more; moderate‐certainty evidence; 3075 participants, 7 trials) or time to onset of eczema (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.14; moderate‐certainty evidence; 3349 participants, 9 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may increase the risk of IgE‐mediated food allergy by one to three years of age (RR 2.53, 95% CI 0.99 to 6.49; low‐certainty evidence; 976 participants, 1 trial) but may not change risk of allergic sensitisation to a food allergen by age one to three years (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.71; low‐certainty evidence; 1794 participants, 3 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may slightly increase risk of parent report of immediate reaction to a common food allergen at two years (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61; low‐certainty evidence; 1171 participants, 1 trial); however, this was only seen for cow’s milk, and may be unreliable due to over‐reporting of milk allergy in infants. Skin care interventions during infancy probably increase risk of skin infection over the intervention period (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.75; risk difference 17 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI one more to 38 more; moderate‐certainty evidence; 2728 participants, 6 trials) and may increase the risk of infant slippage over the intervention period (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.99; low‐certainty evidence; 2538 participants, 4 trials) and stinging/allergic reactions to moisturisers (RR 2.24, 95% 0.67 to 7.43; low‐certainty evidence; 343 participants, 4 trials), although CIs for slippages and stinging/allergic reactions were wide and include the possibility of no effect or reduced risk. Preplanned subgroup analyses showed that the effects of interventions were not influenced by age, duration of intervention, hereditary risk, filaggrin ( FLG ) mutation, chromosome 11 intergenic variant rs2212434,   or classification of intervention type for risk of developing eczema. We could not evaluate these effects on risk of food allergy. Evidence was insufficient to show whether adherence to interventions influenced the relationship between skin care interventions and eczema or food allergy development. Authors' conclusions Based on low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence, skin care interventions such as emollients during the first year of life in healthy infants are probably not effective for preventing eczema; may increase risk of food allergy; and probably increase risk of skin infection. Further study is needed to understand whether different approaches to infant skin care might prevent eczema or food allergy. Plain language summary Skin care interventions for preventing eczema and food allergy Does moisturising baby skin prevent eczema or food allergies? Key messages Skin care treatments in babies, such as using moisturisers on the skin during the first year of life, probably do not prevent babies from developing eczema; may increase the chance of food allergy; and probably increase the chance of skin infection. This review looked at the prevention of eczema and food allergy only. Skin care treatments are still important to treat eczema.  What are allergies? An immune response is how the body recognises and defends itself against substances that appear harmful. An allergy is a reaction of the body's immune system to a particular food or substance (an allergen) that is usually harmless. Different allergies affect different parts of the body, and their effects can be mild or serious. Food allergies and eczema Eczema is a common skin condition  that causes dry, itchy, cracked skin. Eczema is common in children, often developing before their first birthday, and may be long‐lasting. Allergies to food can cause itching in the mouth, a raised itchy red rash, swelling of the face, stomach symptoms, or difficulty breathing. They usually happen within two hours after a food is eaten. People with food allergies often have other allergic conditions, such as asthma, hay fever, and eczema. Why we did this Cochrane Review We wanted to learn how skin care affects the risk of a baby developing eczema or food allergies. Skin care treatments included: • putting moisturisers on a baby's skin; • bathing babies with water containing moisturisers or moisturising oils; • advising parents to use less soap, or to bathe their child less often; • using water softeners.  We also wanted to know if these skin care treatments cause any unwanted effects.  What did we do? We searched for studies of different types of skin care for healthy babies (aged up to one year) with no previous food allergy, eczema, or other skin condition. Search date:  we incorporated evidence published up to July 2021. We were interested in studies that reported: • how many children developed eczema, or food allergy, by age one to three years; • how severe the eczema was (according to a researcher and to parents); • how long it took for eczema to develop; • parents' reports of immediate (under two hours) reactions to a food allergen; • how many children developed sensitivity to a particular food allergen; • any unwanted effects. We assessed the strengths and weaknesses of each study to determine how reliable the results might be, and then combined the results of the relevant studies and looked at overall effects.   What we found We found 33 studies, involving 25,827 babies, that assessed any type of skin intervention. The included studies took place in Europe, Australia, Japan, and the USA, most often at children's hospitals. Skin care was compared against no skin care or usual skin care for babies in that country. Treatment and follow‐up times ranged from 24 hours to three years. Many studies (13) tested the use of moisturisers; the other studies mainly tested the use of bathing and cleansing products and how often they were used. Of the 33 included studies, only 11 studies had comparable outcomes of eczema, food allergy, or adverse effects and were combined for analysis. All of these studies enrolled babies before they were one month old, and  eight of these studies included babies thought to be at high risk for developing eczema.  What are the main results of our review? Compared to no skin care or standard care, moisturisers: • probably do not change the chance of developing eczema by age one to three years (7 studies; 3075 babies), or the time needed for eczema to develop (9 studies; 3349 babies); • may increase the chance of developing a food allergy as judged by a researcher (1 study; 976 babies) by age one to three years; • may slightly increase the number of immediate reactions to a common food allergen at two years, as reported by parents (1 study; 1171 babies); • probably cause more skin infections (6 studies; 2728 babies); • may increase unwanted effects, such as a stinging feeling or an allergic reaction to moisturisers (4 studies; 343 babies); • may increase the chance of babies slipping (4 studies; 2538 babies); • may not affect the chance of developing sensitivity to food allergens (3 studies; 1797 babies) by age one to three years. Confidence in our results We are moderately confident in our results for developing eczema and the time needed to develop eczema. We are less confident about our results for food allergy or sensitivity, which are based on small numbers of studies with widely varying results. These results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. Our confidence in the review findings for skin infections is moderate, but low for stinging or allergic reactions and slipping.
