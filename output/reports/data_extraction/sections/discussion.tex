\section{Discussion}


Previously examined factors that influence the need and timing of endoscopic intervention for FBI include the patient’s age, comorbid conditions, the characteristics of the ingested item (size, shape, content, anatomic location), and longer duration since the time of ingestion.\cite{Ikenberry_2011}

In prison populations,
On multivariate analyses, hospital admission was associated with number of items ingested (OR 1.3, P < 0.05). The need for endoscopy was independently associated with ingestion of multiple objects (OR 3.3, P < 0.05). Surgical therapy was significantly associated with increasing number of ingested items (OR 1.07 per item, P < 0.05). Endoscopy is associated with significantly lower odds of surgery (OR 0.13, P < 0.01). \cite{Dalal_2013}. 

Did not examine rates of true ingestion in larger studies. 

Did not examine item location.
