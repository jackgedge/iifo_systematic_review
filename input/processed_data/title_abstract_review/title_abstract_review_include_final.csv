The medicolegal literature contains a number of references to esophageal injury. Certain excerpts dealing with several types of potential actions are extracted: (1) suits to recover damages for esophageal perforation in which negligent endoscopy was claimed; (2) suits following endoscopic accidents in which lack of informed consent was claimed; and (3) suits for professional liability based on misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis, or wrong treatment of esophageal perforation.
This review considers all possible modes of esophageal injury, based on a schema originally published in 1954 and more recently modified in 1970. For each category of injury there are detailed discussions of diagnosis and treatment. The best available knowledge of present-day modalities has been based on a survey of the literature for the past decade. When diverse methods of treatment were encountered, we have made comments consistent with our personal experience, when appropriate.",False,,,,,,,,False,

Pulmonary Aspiration Continues To Be An Ever...,"The term pulmonary aspiration complex represents the various types of pulmonary aspiration based on the nature of the material aspirated. Pulmonary aspiration continues to be an ever-threatening clinical problem even though knowledge of lung defense mechanisms and predisposing factors of aspiration has been advanced to a point which allows identification of patients at risk of suffering pulmonary aspiration. The identification of patients at risk however has not permitted adequate preventive measures from being exercised. This problem persists in part because few of the predisposing factors are reversible or controllable to a degree which would preclude pulmonary aspiration. In addition, the clinical diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration is more often tentative than absolute and based on the clinical setting and changes demonstrated on serial chest radiographs. This situation emphasizes the role of the radiologist and his knowledge of radiographic findings in pulmonary aspiration in suggesting the diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration. The diagnosis may then be confirmed by additional chest radiographs or by bronchoscopy and the retrieval of the aspirated material.
An understanding of the pathophysiology of the types of pulmonary aspiration serves to increase the awareness of certain pulmonary complications from aspiration, to select appropriate diagnostic studies, and to institute specific therapy. However, the nature of the material aspirated by a patient may not be obvious initially unless the episode is witnessed and may only be determined in retrospect in some cases. Thus, radiologists play a primary role in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration. Frequently, radiologists must integrate the chest radiographic findings of pulmonary aspirationthe distribution, types of parenchymal opacities, and the expected temporal changes in these opacities, with the patient's clinical situation to establish a diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration (Tables 5, 6).
Until recently, therapy of pulmonary aspiration was standardized, pragmatic, and frequently lacked an understanding of the distinct types of pulmonary aspiration. Controversy still surrounds some aspects of therapy. Perhaps, with additional efforts.",False,,,,,,,,False,

(""chronic group""), uncertain in four (""uncertain group""); and the foreign body was
a broncholith in five patients (""broncholith group""). In the chronic and uncertain
groups, no precipitating factor was found and bone was the most common foreign
body. In the chronic group, a choking history was obtained before bronchoscopy
in only 15 patient.
Clinical manifestations and roentgenograms were nonspecific in most cases, except
in the acute group. In the chronic group, the mean duration of residence of the
foreign body was 25.8 months. The diagnosis was delayed due to absence of a
choking history and invisibility of the foreign body on chest films in 12, due to
patient's ignorance in 14, due to physician's ignorance in 1, and due to previous
unsuccessful retrieval attempts in 2 patients.
The main indication for bronchoscopy in the acute group was a choking history
or a visible foreign body on the chest film. In the chronic group, a choking histo-
ry or conditions leading to ""suspicion of an endobronchial lesion"" were the main
indications. The foreign body was removed with a fibreoptic bronchoscope in over

able therapeutic option in selected conditions.",False,,,,,,,,False,

A minority of FB ingestions are not identified for weeks to years and present significant problems for retrieval. The purpose of this study was to describe the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies needed to care for children who have chronic esophageal FBs.
Methods: Five children were identified as having retained esophageal FBs 2 months to 2 years after ingestion. During the same 3-year period, 100 children who had acute FBs were identified and had their foreign bodies removed endoscopically. The average age of the children was 3 years (range, 2.4 to 3.5).
Results: The average age of the five children identified in this study was 3 years. The items ingested included coins, a heart pendant, a clothespin spring, and a toy soldier. Complications from chronically retained foreign bodies were bronchoesophageal fistula, mediastinitis, esophageal diverticulum, and lobar atelectasis. One patient died from an aortoesophageal fistula. In all children, endoscopic removal was attempted. Barium esophagram was then performed, and foreign bodies were eventually removed via right thoracotomy.
Conclusions: Long-retained esophageal FBs are extremely morbid and life threatening. History most often identifies excess salivation, new onset asthma, and/or recurrent upper respiratory infections.

METHODS: For children under 15 years, all Victorian public hospital admissions, July 1987 to June 1995, due to asphyxiation or 'foreign body entering through other orifice' (which includes ingestions), were reviewed. Emergency department presentations due to asphyxiation and foreign body ingestion provided information on circumstances of, and the type of foreign bodies involved in the injuries. RESULTS: The childhood average annual admission rate for asphyxiation was 15.1 per 100,000. Food related asphyxiation peaked in infants under 1 year, and declined to low levels by 3 years. The main foods involved were nuts, carrot, apple, and candy. The rate of non-food related asphyxiation was relatively constant to 3 years of age and then declined by 6 years. Mechanical suffocation was less common. The annual admission rate for 'foreign body entering through other orifice' was 31.7 per 100,000. These injuries peaked in 2-3 year olds then gradually declined. About 80% of these foreign body admissions were ingestions, with coins being the major object ingested. Admission rates for these causes remained constant over the eight years. Asphyxiation resulted in a higher proportion admitted and longer hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of suffocation and strangulation needs to focus on a safe sleeping environment and avoidance of ropes and cords, while foreign body asphyxiation and ingestion needs a focus on education of parents and child carers regarding age, appropriate food, risk of play with coins, and other small items. Legislation for toy small parts could be extended to those used by children up to the age of 5 years, and to other products marketed for children. Design changes and warning labels also have a place in prevention.",False,,True,3.0,False,,Unclear,"Likely to be accidental , but might include some intentional foreign objects",False,

The authors prefer to initially attempt removal of smooth, radiopaque esophageal foreign bodies using the balloon technique and then proceed to rigid esophagoscopy if unsuccessful.
Methods: The authors reviewed their 7-year experience with this approach in 276 children with esophageal foreign bodies.
Results: One hundred seventy-three children underwent attempted balloon extraction, and 146 of these underwent successful removal with this method. Fifteen remained lodged in the esophagus and were subsequently removed by esophagoscopy, and 12 passed into the stomach and were observed. The only complication was one episode of epistaxis that resolved. Success of the balloon method was not related to patient age, foreign body duration, location, or presenting symptoms. The use of more than 5 minutes of fluoroscopy time was associated with a low likelihood of successful extraction.
Conclusion: The balloon extraction technique is a safe and effective alternative to rigid esophagoscopy for the removal of slected esophageal foreign bodies in children.",False,,,,,,,,False,

Early diagnosis and treatment can decrease morbidity and length of hospital stay in these children. Three cases of delayed diagnosis in children with bronchial (2) and esophageal (1) foreign bodies are presented. In dealing with young children it is important to maintain a high clinical suspicion of a foreign body and to perform a detailed history and physical examination. Options in radiographic analysis of the patient with a suspected foreign body, probable locations of the foreign body, and the likelihood of definitive radiographic findings are discussed. Importantly, a negative radiographic analysis does not rule out the presence of an aerodigestive tract foreign body. Two flow charts for the evaluation of patients who have possibly ingested or inhaled a foreign body are presented to aid the primary care physician in diagnosis.",False,,,,,,,,False,

Patients: Nine Patients Presenting With Aef Were Observed Between May 1988 And April 2002. There Were 4 Men And 5 Women With A Mean Age Of 54.3 Years (Range, 32-77 Years). Six Patients Presented Secondary Aef After Aortic Repair. Two Patients Presented Primary Aef After Rupture Of An Atherosclerotic Aneurysm Into The Esophagus. In The Remaining Patient, Aef Was Caused By Swallowing A Fishbone. In 6 Cases Involving True Aef With A Direct Communication Between The Aorta And Esophagus, Massive Exsanguinating Hematemesis Occurred. It Was Usually Preceded By Minor Sentinel Bleeding, Two Patients Presented Esophagoparaprosthetic Fistula (Eppf). One Patient Presented Primary Aef That Was Contained By A Large Thrombus In The Communication. The Clinical Picture In These 3 Patients Involved Severe Sepsis Without Hemorrhage. Results: Two Patients Died As A Result Of Massive Hemorrhage Before Assessment And Surgical Treatment Could Be Undertaken. One 77-Year-Old Woman Presenting Eppf Refused To Undergo Surgery And Died Because Of Infection. The Remaining 6 Patients Underwent Surgical Treatment With Various Outcomes. One Man Died During Thoracotomy Caused By Exsanguinating Hemorrhage. One Woman Presenting Eppf Was Treated By Exclusion Followed By Ascending Aorta To Abdominal Aorta Bypass Grafting, Removal Of The Prosthesis, Esophageal Exclusion, And Directed Esophageal Fistula. She Died Of Infection. The Other 4 Patients Were Treated By In Situ Aortic Allograft Replacement. The Damaged Esophagus Was Repaired By Using The Tha1 Technique In 1 Patient.

Coins Are By Far The Most Common Ingested Foreign Bodies. When Ingested Coins Become Lodged In  The Esophagus, They May Cause Serious Complications If They Are Not Removed In A  Timely Manner. Endoscopic Removal Is The Preferred Treatment In Many Pediatric  Centers As Its Safety And Effectiveness Are Well Established. Objectives: We  Performed This Study To Evaluate Safety And Effectiveness Of An Alternative  Method Of Managing Esophageal Coins, Using Bougienage Technique. Methods:  Previously Healthy Children Presenting To The Local Emergency Room With  Uncomplicated, Witnessed Coin Ingestion Of Less Than 24 Hours Duration Were  Prospectively Recruited With An Intent-To-Treat Analysis. A Single Oral Passage  Of A Hurst Bougie Dilator Was Performed By A Gastroenterologist To Dislodge The  Esophageal Coin Into The Stomach. If Bougienage Was Successful (X-Ray Showing  Coin In The Stomach), Patients Were Discharged And Instructions Were Given For  Monitoring Stools Until Passage Of The Coin Through Anus Was Confirmed. If  Bougienage Was Unsuccessful, The Child Developed Symptoms At Any Time Or If A  Coin Remained Intragastric For 4 Weeks, Endoscopic Removal Was Planned. Children  Whose Parents Declined To Participate In The Bougienage Treatment Received The  Standard Endoscopic Removal And Their Hospital Records Were Used As Controls.  Results: A Total Of 10 Children Were Enrolled In This Study, With A Mean Age Of  3.2 Years (11 Mo To 10 Y), 6 Boys And 4 Girls. All Received Little Or No  Sedation. Nine Children (90%) Were Successfully Treated Using Bougienage, All Of  Whom Spontaneously Passed The Ingested Coins, With A Mean Duration Of 2.6 Days (1  To 7 D) Without Subsequent Intervention. A Single Case Failed Bougienage And  Underwent Endoscopic Removal. Three Children Declined Bougienage Treatment And  Underwent Endoscopic Removal. There Were No Reported Minor Or Major Adverse  Events With Any Of Our Cases. The Mean Health Care Cost For The Hospital Visit  For Bougienage Treatment Was $1210, Compared With $3100 For The Endoscopic  Removal (P<0.001). Furthermore, The Mean Time Spent In The Hospital From  Diagnosis To Discharge Was 2 Hours For Bougienage-Treated Patients Compared With  8 Hours For Endoscopic Treatment (P<0.001).

We Studied The Poorly  Understood Group Of Patients Who Intentionally Ingest Fbs. Methods: Cases Of  Intentional Ingestion Of Fbs (N = 305) Were Identified, Retrospectively, From An  Electronic Endoscopy Database And Followed. Cases Occurred Among 33 Different  Patients, Who Underwent Endoscopy From October 1, 2001, To July 31, 2009 (39.0  Cases/Year); 79% Were Diagnosed With A Psychiatric Disorder. Financial Cost  Analysis Was Performed Using Hospital Billing And Cost Systems. Results: Commonly  Ingested Fbs Included Pens (23.6%), Batteries (9.2%), Knives (7.2%), And Razor  Blades (6.9%). Most Endoscopic Procedures Were Performed Under General  Anesthesia. Fbs Were Commonly Retrieved By Snares (58.0%), Rat-Toothed Forceps  (14.4%), And Nets (11.5%), Assisted Sometimes By Use Of Overtubes (10.8%), And  Hoods (4.6%). Fb Extraction Was Unsuccessful At The Initial Endoscopy In Only 20  Cases; 2 Cases Eventually Required Surgical Extraction. Minor Complications  Occurred In 11 Endoscopies. There Were No Deaths Or Perforations. The Total  Estimated Costs Were $2,018,073 ($1,500,627 In Hospital Costs, $240,640 In  Physician Fees, And $276,806 For Security Services). Costs Were Significantly  Higher For Inpatients. Major Payers Were Medicare (48%) And Medicaid (31%).  Conclusions: Intentional Fb Ingestion Occurs Among A Relatively Small Number Of  Patients With Psychiatric Disorders And Is Costly. Endoscopic Retrieval Is  Relatively Effective And Safe, But Often Requires General Anesthesia. These Cases  Utilize Significant Hospital And Fiscal Resources. Attention Should Be Focused On  Preventing These Recurrent And Costly Episodes.",,False,,,,,,,,False,

It Frequently Causes Some Degree Of Discomfort To The Patient. Various Different Topical Agents, Which Are Intended To Reduce This Discomfort, Are In Common Use. This Review Aimed To Assess The Effectiveness Of The Various Agents. Objectives To Assess The Effectiveness Of Topical Preparations Used To Reduce Discomfort And Facilitate Npl In Adults. Search Methods We Searched The Cochrane Ear, Nose And Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; The Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials (Central); Pubmed; Embase; Cinahl; Web Of Science; Biosis Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; Isrctn And Additional Sources For Published And Unpublished Trials. The Date Of The Most Recent Search Was 14 April 2010. Selection Criteria Randomised Controlled Trials (Rcts) Looking At The Effect Of Topical Anaesthetic Or Vasoconstrictor Agents Used Reduce Discomfort And Facilitate Npl In Adult Patients. Data Collection And Analysis Two Review Authors Independently Selected Studies, Extracted Data And Assessed Risk Of Bias. We Contacted Trial Authors For Further Information Where Necessary. The Primary Outcome Measured Was Pain/Discomfort. Secondary Outcomes That Were Looked At Included Side Effects Of The Topical Medications, Ease Of The Procedure And The Quality Of The View From The Operator'S Perspective. Main Results We Included Eight Rcts (746 Participants) In The Review. The Risk Of Bias In The Studies Was Generally Low. Five Studies Did Not Demonstrate Any Advantage In Using A Topical Treatment Prior To Endoscopy. One Study Suggested That A Vasoconstrictor Alone Should Be Used To Reduce The General Level Of Unpleasantness. Two Studies Did Not Compare Treatment Against Placebo Or No Treatment, So It Was Not Possible To Draw Meaningful Conclusions From Them. There May Be Some Unpleasant Side Effects From The Use Of Topical Preparations, Such As Unpleasant Taste. There Was Variation In The Format Of The Outcome Data And A Lack Of Complete Data; None Of The Included Studies Reported Their Results In A Way That Would Allow Pooling And We Could Not Therefore Perform Meta‐Analysis. Authors' Conclusions The Included Studies Do Not Demonstrate Any Evidence To Support The Use Of Topical Treatments Prior To The Use Of A Fibre‐Optic Nasal Endoscope. Some Go As Far As To Suggest That These Agents Should Not Be Used Due To Cost And Unpleasant Side Effects. Five Studies Did Not Demonstrate Any Advantage In Terms Of Reducing Pain Or Discomfort When Using A Topical Treatment Prior To Endoscopy. The Absence Of Demonstrable Effect May Be Due To Relatively Small Patient Groups. It Is Therefore Possible That There Is A Small Effect Of Using These Sprays. Further Research Using Standardised Reporting Methods Is Needed. Plain Language Summary Topical Anaesthetic Or Vasoconstrictor (Blood Vessel Narrowing) Preparations For Flexible Fibre‐Optic Nasal Pharyngoscopy And Laryngoscopy Topical Medications Are Often Applied To The Inside Of A Patient'S Nose Prior To Examining The Nose, Sinuses And Throat With A Flexible Nasopharyngolaryngoscope. The Aim Of This Is To Reduce Any Discomfort The Patient May Feel And Also To Improve The Adequacy Of The Examination. Types Of Preparation Include Lidocaine, Phenylephrine And Lidocaine, Oxymetazoline, Xylometazoline And Cocaine And They Are Usually Administered As A Spray, Although They May Also Be In The Form Of A Solution Which Can Be Applied To Cotton Wool And Placed In The Nasal Cavity, Or As Gels, Pastes Or Creams. We Looked For Randomised Controlled Trials Comparing Any Of These Topical Treatments With Placebo, No Treatment Or Another Topical Treatment In Adult Patients Undergoing Nasal Pharyngolaryngoscopy (Npl). We Included Eight Studies In The Review (With A Total Of 746 Patients). It Was Not Possible To Combine Data From Any Of The Studies, Therefore We Assessed The Individual Study Results. Five Of The Studies Did Not Demonstrate Any Advantage, In Terms Of Reducing Pain Or Discomfort, Of Using A Topical Treatment Prior To Endoscopy. One Of These Suggested That A Vasoconstrictor (Xylometazoline) Alone Reduced The Level Of ""General Unpleasantness"". Two Studies Did Not Compare The Treatment Against Placebo Or No Treatment.

The Factors Associated With Sp Such As Age, The Type, Size, And Initial  Location Of The Fbs Were Analyzed. Results: Foreign Bodies Were Spontaneously  Passed In 145 Patients (58.2%), Endoscopic Removal Was Performed In 100 Patients  (40.2%), And Operative Removal Was Performed In 4 Patients (1.6%). Most Sp Fbs  Were Passed Within 5 Days.

in children, whereas the majority of adults will have neu-

objects in these patients, who clinically can be separated
into 4 groups: (1) malingering, (2) psychosis, (3) pica, and (4)

Fish bone (FB) is one of the common causes of foreign body impaction in the pharynx and esophagus.
Purpose
To investigate the efficacy of 64-slice multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) for the evaluation of pharynx and upper esophageal FB foreign bodies.
Material and Methods
Sixty-six patients with suspected FB foreign body ingestion were examined by plain radiography (n_=_40) and unenhanced MDCT (n_=_66). We analyzed the presence, location, size, shape, and lying position of the foreign bodies.
Results
On MDCT, 46 foreign bodies were detected. Among them, 45 were confirmed by endoscopy. The sensitivity of MDCT for the detection of foreign bodies was 100%, which was superior to that of the plain radiography (51.7%). The location of the foreign bodies was most common in the upper esophagus (n_=_22, 47.8%), followed by pharyngoesophageal junction (n_=_10, 21.7%), transjunctional (n_=_7, 15.2%), hypopharynx (n_=_5, 10.9%), and oropharynx (n_=_2, 4.3%). Their longest length was 5.340.1_mm (mean, 21.3_mm). Thirty-three FBs (71.7%) were linear and 13 (28.3%) were flat in shape. They showed transverse (n_=_23, 50.0%), parallel (n_=_13, 28.3%), and oblique positions (n_=_10, 21.7%) to the long axis of the pharynx and esophagus, respectively.
Conclusion
MDCT is useful for the evaluation of the pharynx and upper esophageal FB foreign bodies.",False,,,,,,,,False,

The ingestion of foreign body is a common problem in children, some of which may cause damage or may be associated with toxicity.
Objective
To evaluate and analyze the pattern of foreign bodies in children in the esophagus, ears and nose with review of the techniques for removal in the emergency department.
Methods
From Sept 1, 2008 to May 30, 2010, a review of all children with foreign bodies in the esophagus, ears and in the nose was done to assess the patterns and treatment outcomes. The source and the study group were (N-72). Data concerning socio- demographics, characterization, presenting symptoms and signs, techniques of retrieval and outcomes were extracted and filled in a previously prepared protocol sheet. Descriptive analysis was done using SPSS- computer statistical software.
Results
During the study period, 72 children, victims of foreign bodies in the esophagus, ears and in the nose were included in the study. Of these 44 (61.1%), 28 (38.9%) were male and female children, respectively. The age ranged from 11 months to 14 years with (mean = 4 years). The most affected age group was between 0-5 years accounting for 46 (63.9%) followed by the age group between 6-10 years accounting for 20 (27.8%) of all cases. Males 44 (61.1%) were predominantly most affected than females 28 (38.8%). The location of foreign bodies in this study were in the ears 45 (62.5%), esophagus 17 (23.6%) and in the nose 10 (13.9%) in order of their frequency. Swallowed foreign bodies were successfully removed by Magill forceps. Foreign bodies in the ears and in the nose were removed by careful but different techniques depending on the type and the clinical condition of the patient at time of intervention.
Conclusion
Our study revealed a higher number of patients with foreign bodies in the ears and in the esophagus. Only a small number ofpatients presented with FBS in the nose. Food items in the ears, in the nose and coins in the esophagus were items frequently observed. Early suspicion, early diagnosis and prompt intervention have attributed to reduce morbidities of major events.",False,,,,,,,,False,

However, In 10-20% Of The Cases An Endoscopic Intervention Is Deemed Necessary.  True Fb Ingestion Has Its Greatest Incidence In Children, Psychiatric Patients  And Prisoners. On The Other Hand, Food Bolus Impaction Typically Occurs In The  Elderly Population With An Underlying Esophageal Pathology. The Most Serious  Situations, With Higher Rates Of Complications, Are Associated With Prolonged  Esophageal Impaction, Ingestion Of Sharp And Long Objects, Button Batteries And  Magnets. Physicians Should Recognize Early Alarm Symptoms, Such As Complete  Dysphagia, Distressed Patients Not Able To Manage Secretions, Or Clinical Signs  Of Perforation.

The management and clinical course in pediatric patients who had ingested foreign body were investigated retrospectively to evaluate the frequency and factor associated with successful removal of fishbone foreign body.
Methods
Based on the medical records of patients younger than 15 years old who visited emergency room because of foreign body ingestion from January 1999 to December 2012, the authors reviewed clinical characteristics including type of ingested foreign bodies, time to visits, managements and complications.
Results
Fishbone (50.1%) was the most common ingested foreign body in children. Among 416 patients with ingested fishbone, 245 (58.9%) were identified and removed using laryngoscope, rigid or flexible endoscope from pharynx or upper esophagus by otolaryngologists and pediatric gastroenterologists. The kind of ingested fish bone in children was diverse. The mean age of identified and removed fishbone group was 7.39 years old, and higher than that of unidentified fishbone group (5.81 years old, p<0.001). Identified and removed fishbone group had shorter time until hospital visit than the unidentified fishbone group (2.03 vs. 6.47 hours, p<0.001). No complication due to ingested fishbone or procedure occurred.
Conclusion
Older age and shorter time from accident to hospital visit were the different factors between success and failure on removal of ingested fish bone in children.",False,,,,,,,,False,

Our Previous Research Examined Determinants Of Hospital Admission, Endoscopy, And Surgery Among Prisoners Who Ingest Foreign Objects. However, Little Is Known About The Financial Impact Of These Events On Healthcare Facilities That Service The Prisoner Population. This Study Aims To Fill This Gap By Examining Hospital Charges Attributable To 435 Prisoner Episodes Of Iifo. Methods: A Retrospective Review Of All Prisoners Who Presented To Our Medical Center With The Complaint Of Iifo Was Conducted. Both Institutional Review Board And Bureau Of Prisons Approvals Were Obtained Before Data Collection. All Prisoners Ages 18-75 Were Included Between The Dates Of January 2004 And December 2011. Episodes Were Divided Into Three Categories: (A) Unverified Iifo Wherein Ingested Object Was Claimed By The Patient But Never Identified; (B) Verified Iifo Wherein Ingested Object Was Clearly Identified; (C) Secondary Events Due To Direct Complications Of Previous Iifo Episode (S). The Temporal Occurrence Of Iifo Was Organized By Increasing The Number Of Episodes And Grouped Accordingly. Detailed List Of Hospital Charges Was Obtained For Every Iifo Episode Including: (A) Emergency Services, (B) Procedures, (C) Laboratory, (D) Surgical Supplies, (E) Allied Health Services, (F) Radiology Studies, (G) Anesthesiology Charges, (H) Pharmacy, And (H) Intensive Care Costs. Descriptive Statistics Were Used To Analyze Basic Data. Kruskal-Wallis Test Was Used To Examine Differences Among Nonnormally Distributed Variables And Sub-Groups. Statistical Significance Set At Alpha = 0.05. Results: A Total Of 435 Iifo Episodes Occurred During The Study Period In A Population Of 125 Patients (Mean Age 33.8 +/- 11.7 Years, Median Age 34 [Range 19-75] Years, 92.8% Male). Hospital Charges Associated With These Episodes Totaled $6,209,557. There Were 94 Unverified Iifos, 332 Verified Iifos, And 9 Secondary Events. Verified Iifos Were Associated With Significantly Greater Median Charges ($5,860) Than Unverified Iifos ($3,997) And Secondary Events Carried Lower Cost ($3,501) Than The Former Two (P < 0.01). We Also Observed A Pattern Of Escalating Costs Associated With Increasing Number Of Sequential Iifo Episodes, With The 1St Episode Carrying Median Charges Of $4,683 And Episodes Numbered 11+ Carrying Median Charges Of $7,698 (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Hospital Charges Associated With The Care Of Prisoners Who Ingest Foreign Objects Tend To Escalate Over Time. Although Charges In Most Of The Categories Demonstrated Increases With Greater Numbers Of Ingestions, The Largest Contributors To This Pattern Of Escalating Charges Included Radiology, Pharmacy, Hospital Room Charges, And Surgical Services.

ported clinical problem. There are no data to
evaluate the prevalence of this phenomenon
in Poland. In the United States the annual
death rate due to foreign body ingestion is
estimated at up to 1500-2700 (1). In 80% of
cases foreign body ingestion is unintentional
and reported in children (2). Among adults
unintentional foreign body ingestion is re-
ported most commonly in the elderly and al-
cohol-dependent patients (3). Some literature
indicates that intentional foreign body inges-
tion among adults accounts for only 10% of all
cases (4), there are however studies suggesting
that intentional foreign body ingestion ac-
counts for up to 92% of all cases of foreign body
ingestion (5). Multiple retrospective studies
confirm consistently that intentional foreign
body ingestions are most commonly reported
in patients with psychiatric disorders, mental
impairment and in prison inmates (4-7).
Considering all cases together, the major-
ity of foreign bodies pass spontaneously,
10-20% require endoscopic intervention and
only 1% are removed surgically (3). Inten-
tional foreign body ingestion is associated
with much more severe consequences, which
require emergency medical intervention in up
to 76% of patients and surgery in 28% of pa-
tients (8).

pends on the characteristics of the ingested
foreign body, such as: size, shape, presence of
sharp edges, its location, time from ingestion,
severity of clinical symptoms and development
of potential complications (5). on the other

Objectives To Assess The Effects Of Sealing Techniques Following Pprom Against Each Other, Or Versus Standard Care (Including No Sealant), On Maternal And Neonatal Outcomes. Search Methods We Searched The Cochrane Pregnancy And Childbirth Group’S Trials Register (30 May 2016) And Reference Lists Of Retrieved Studies. Selection Criteria Randomised And Quasi‐Randomised Controlled Trials Comparing Different Techniques For Sealing Preterm Prelabour Ruptured Membranes. Cluster‐Randomised Trials And Trials Using A Cross‐Over Design Were Not Eligible For Inclusion In This Review. We Planned To Include Abstracts When Sufficient Information Was Provided. Data Collection And Analysis Two Review Authors Independently Assessed Trials For Inclusion And Assessed Trial Quality. Two Review Authors Independently Extracted Data. Data Were Checked For Accuracy. Main Results We Included Two Studies (Involving 141 Women ‐ With Data From 124 Women). We Considered Both Studies As Being At High Risk Of Bias. Meta‐Analysis Was Not Possible Because The Included Studies Examined Different Interventions (Both In Comparison With Standard Care) And Reported On Few, But Different, Outcomes. One Study Compared Cervical Adapter (Mechanical Sealing), And The Other Study Examined An Immunological Membrane Sealant. Neither Of The Included Studies Reported On This Review'S Primary Outcome Of Interest ‐ Perinatal Mortality. Similarly, Data Were Not Reported For The Majority Of This Review'S Secondary Infant And Maternal Outcomes. Cervical Adapter (Mechanical Sealing) Versus Standard Care (One Study, Data From 35 Participants) No Data Were Reported For This Review'S Primary Outcome ‐  Perinatal Mortality . Data Were Reported For Few Of This Review'S Infant Or Maternal Secondary Outcomes. There Was No Clear Difference Between The Mechanical Sealing Group And The Standard Care Control In Relation To The Incidence Of  Neonatal Sepsis  (Risk Ratio (Rr) 1.19, 95% Confidence Interval (Ci) 0.28 To 5.09 ( Very Low‐Quality Evidence )) Or  Chorioamnionitis  (Rr 1.19, 95% Ci 0.28 To 5.09 ( Very Low‐Quality Evidence )). Oral Immunological Membrane Sealant Versus Standard Care (One Study, Data From 94 Participants) No Data Were Available For  Perinatal Mortality  (This Review'S Primary Outcome) Or For The Majority Of This Review'S Infant And Maternal Secondary Outcomes. Compared To Standard Care, The Immunological Membrane Sealant Was Associated With A Reduction In  Preterm Birth Less Than 37 Weeks  (Rr 0.48, 95% Ci 0.34 To 0.68 ( Very Low‐Quality Evidence )) And A Reduction In  Neonatal Death  (Rr 0.38, 95% Ci 0.19 To 0.75 ( Very Low‐Quality Evidence) ). However, There Was No Clear Difference Between Groups In Terms Of  Neonatal Sepsis  (Rr 0.64, 95% Ci 0.28 To 1.46 ( Very Low‐Quality Evidence )) Or  Respiratory Distress Syndrome  (Rr 0.64, 95% Ci 0.28 To 1.46 ( Very Low‐Quality Evidence )). Authors' Conclusions There Is Insufficient Evidence To Evaluate Sealing Procedures For Pprom. There Were No Data Relating To This Review'S Primary Outcome (Perinatal Mortality) And The Majority Of Our Infant And Maternal Secondary Outcomes Were Not Reported In The Two Included Studies. There Was Limited Evidence To Suggest That An Immunological Membrane Sealant Was Associated With A Reduction In Preterm Birth At Less Than 37 Weeks And Neonatal Death, But These Results Should Be Interpreted With Caution As This Is Based On One Small Study, With A High Risk Of Bias, And The Intervention Has Not Been Tested In Other Studies. Although Midtrimester Pprom Is Not A Rare Occurrence, There Are Only A Small Amount Of Published Data Addressing The Benefits And Risks Of Sealing Procedures. Most Of These Studies Are Retrospective And Cohort Based And Could Therefore Not Be Included In Our Data‐Analysis. This Review Highlights The Paucity Of Prospective Randomised Trials In This Area. Current Evidence Provides Limited Information Both On Effectiveness And Safety For The Interventions Described. Given The Paucity Of High‐Quality Data, We Recommend That Future Research Efforts Focus On The Conduct Of Randomised Trials Assessing The Effect Of Promising Interventions That Have Been Only Evaluated To Date In Cohort Studies (E.G. Amniopatch). Future Trials Should Address Outcomes Including Perinatal Mortality, Preterm Birth, Neonatal Death, Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Neonatal Sepsis And Developmental Delay. They Should Also Evaluate Maternal Outcomes Including Sepsis, Mode Of Delivery, Length Of Hospital Stay And Emotional Well‐Being. Plain Language Summary Treatments For Improving Outcomes For Mother And Baby When The Waters Have Broken Too Early What Is The Issue? Preterm Prelabour Rupture Of The Membranes (Pprom) Is When The Waters Break At Less Than 37 Weeks' Gestation. It Occurs In One In 50 Pregnancies And Can Happen Spontaneously Or After A Medical Procedure Has Been Performed, For Example, Tests Where A Needle Is Placed In To The Womb To Get A Sample Of Fluid Or Tissue, Or After An Operation Has Been Performed On The Baby Inside The Womb. Why Is This Important? Breaking Of The Waters Early In Pregnancy Can Lead To Significant Problems Including The Baby Being Born Too Soon To Survive, Having Immature Lungs, And Serious Infections. Preterm Babies Are Overall More Likely To Be Ill And To Suffer From Long‐Term Disabilities, If They Do Survive. The Survival Of Babies Affected By Pprom Is Related To How Early It Occurs In The Pregnancy And If An Infection Occurs. In Some Circumstances, The Waters May Reseal Themselves. This Is More Likely To Occur When No Infection Is Present. Several Treatments To Reseal The Membranes Have Been Tried, With Varying Success. Resealing Has Been Attempted By: A) Injecting Clotting Factors And Other Medicines In To The Hole In The Womb To Create A Patch Over The Area That Is Leaking; B) Taking Tablets That May Stimulate The Body’S Immune System To Mend The Area Where The Seal Has Broken; C) Placing A Sponge Over The Hole In The Waters; D) Placing A Seal Over The Neck Of The Womb To Stop Fluid Leaking Out And Prevent Infection. Our Study Is Important Because Finding A Successful Treatment For Pprom May Reduce The Potential Complications That May Happen To The Mother And Baby Such As Preterm Birth (Being Born Before 37 Weeks' Gestation) And Infections. What Did We Find? In Our Study We Assessed The Different Techniques Used For Resealing The Waters. We Aimed To Compare The Survival Of Babies Affected With This Condition Before And After Birth And Look At The Rates Of Complications In Both The Babies And Mothers. We Searched For Trials (30 May 2016) And Found Two Studies That Compared Treatments For Resealing The Membranes After They Had Broken. These Trials Involved 141 Women In Total And Compared Two Completely Different Modes Of Treatment. One Trial Compared The Use Of An Oral Immunological Membrane Sealant To Stimulate The Body’S Immune System To Mend The Area Where The Seal Has Broken And The Other Trial Placed A Mechanical Sealing Device Over The Cervix (Neck Of The Womb) To Stop Fluid Leaking. Unfortunately, Neither Trial Provided Any Data Relating To Death Of The Baby Within The Womb Or In The First 28 Days Of Life (Perinatal Mortality). There Was Limited Evidence To Suggest That Oral Immunological Membrane Sealant Was Associated With A Fewer Babies Being Before 37 Weeks’ Gestation And A Reduction In The Number Of Babies That Died Within The First 28 Days. However, These Results Are Based On  Very Low‐Quality Evidence  From One Small Trial (With Data From 94 Women) That We Judged To Be At A High Risk Of Bias. There Was No Clear Difference Between The Mechanical Sealing Device Group And The Control Group In Relation To The Number Of Babies Who Contracted A Serious Infection (Neonatal Sepsis) Or Chorioamnionitis (A Bacterial Infection That Causes Inflammation Of The Membranes Surrounding The Baby In The Womb). Although These Results Are Based On  Very Low‐Quality Evidence  From One Small Trial (Involving 35 Women) Judged To Be At A High Risk Of Bias. What Does This Mean? Overall, Our Question Remains Unanswered ‐ We Do Not Have Enough Data To Fully Evaluate Sealing Procedures For Pprom. This Review Demonstrates The Lack Of Research In This Area Regarding The Effectiveness And Safety Of Potential Treatments For Pprom. We Recommend That More Research Is Needed To Look At The Different Techniques For Sealing Broken Waters And That This Research Should Focus On The Effectiveness Of The Treatment In Improving Overall Outcomes. The Safety Of The Treatments To Both Mother And Baby Must Be Further Evaluated Before Sealing Techniques Can Be Recommended To Prevent Adverse Outcomes.",,False,2.0,,,,,,,False,

The Patients Were Divided Into Two Groups: Those Complicated With Perforation And Those Without Perforation. Date On Patient Demographics, Symptoms, Foreign Bodies, And Diabetes Were Collected And Analyzed. Study-Specific Odds Ratio And 95% Confidence Intervals (Ci) Were Estimated Using Multivariable Logistic Regression Models. Results: Of 294 Patients With Esophageal Foreign Bodies (41.84% Male, Mean Age, 56.73 Years), 33 (11.22%) Complicated By Perforation. Diabetes (Odds Ratio = 6.00; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.72-20.23), Duration (> 24 H) Of Foreign Bodies Retention (Odds Ratio = 4.25; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.71-10.86), And Preoperative Fever (Odds Ratio = 8.19; 95% Confidence Interval = 3.17-21.74) Were Strongly Associated With An Increased Risk Of Perforation, Whereas The Sensation Of A Foreign Body (Odds Ratio = 0.32; 95% Confidence Interval = 0.09-0.92) Was A Protective Factor Of Perforation. Glucose Level Was Not Observed To Have An Association Among Patients With Or Without Perforation. Conclusions: Diabetes And Duration Of Foreign Body Retention Increase Risk For Esophageal Foreign Bodies Complicated By Perforation, And Cases With Elevated Armpit Temperature May Represented A More Likely Perforation Compared With Those Without Fever.",,False,,,,,,,,False,

The Main Purpose Of This Case ...,"There is a limited number of case presentations in literature re-
lated to esophagus burns and complications as a result of swallow-
ing an alkaline battery. The main purpose of this case presentation
was to discuss the autopsy findings of late-developing complications
of swallowing an alkali battery in the light of the relevant literature.
On the chest radiography of a 9-month old baby with complaints
of vomiting for three days, an opacity was observed consistent with
a foreign body in the esophagus. Esophagoscopy was applied and
the swallowed battery was removed. On the fifth day after the opera-
tion, no complication has been observed to oral feeding was started
and on the following day the patient was discharged. Four days after
discharge, the patient was again brought to hospital with complaints
of blood in vomit and was again hospitalized with a diagnosis of
chemical esophageal burn. The patient died on the following day.
In the performed autopsy, findings of esophagotracheal fistula, cor-
rosive burn and gastrointestinal system bleeding were determined.
As the dimensions of an alkaline battery increase, the contact
surface increases and may this cause greater damage and toxicity. A
long contact period also increases the toxic effect of the battery. Ear-
ly diagnosis is essential to prevent late-developing complications.",False,,,,,,,,False,

This Study Aimed To Analyse The Circumstances Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts In A Japanese Psychiatric Hospital So As To Improve Management And Care. Methods: Incident Reports Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts During A 12.4-Year Period From November 2000 To March 2013 Were Reviewed. A Descriptive Analysis Was Conducted In Terms Of Age, Sex, And Diagnosis Of Patients, As Well As Level, Ward, Situations, And Causes Of Incidents. Results: During The Study Period, 90 Cases Of Self-Harm And Attempted Suicide Involving 58 Patients Were Reported. The Rate Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts Was 0.05 Per 1000 Patient-Days. The Types Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts Included Hanging (N = 25), Wrist Cutting (N = 19), Ingestion Of Foreign Objects (N = 17), And Others (N = 29). The Single Case Of Completed Suicide Involved Hanging, In A Patient With Schizophrenia. Among 55 Patients With Relevant Data, The Most Common Clinical Diagnosis Was Mood Disorder (41.8%), Followed By Schizophrenia (36.4%). Mood Disorder Was 3.5 Times As Prevalent In Females As In Males (14 Vs. 4). Fourteen Patients With Mood Disorder (N = 8) Or Schizophrenia (N = 6) Were Repeatedly Involved In 46 Of 89 Cases Of Self-Harm Or Attempted Suicide; 11 Were Female. One Woman With Mood Disorder Attempted Suicide 9 Times Within The Same Year. The Top 3 Management And Care Factors Related To Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts Were Failure To Adhere To Preventive Procedures (28%), Insufficient Therapeutic Communication (28%), And Difficulty In Predicting Suicide (20%). Conclusion: Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts At This Psychiatric Hospital Occurred At A Rate Of 0.05 Per 1000 Patient-Days Between Late 2000 And Early 2013.

In China, There Have Been A Few Studies Investigating The Prevalence Of Dsh In Heroin-Dependent Patients (Hdps), But Their Rates Varied Widely. We Thus Conducted A Meta-Analysis Of Studies Assessing The Prevalence Of Dsh Among Chinese Hdps. Methods: Relevant Studies Were Retrieved From Major Chinese Databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, And Sinomed) And Western Databases (Pubmed, Embase, And Psycinfo). Two Authors Independently Identified Eligible Studies And Extracted Data. Studies That Included A Representative Sample Of Chinese Hdps And Ascertained Dsh Caseness In A Reliable Way Were Considered As High Quality. Statistical Analysis Was Performed Using R Software. Results: In Total, 15 Eligible Studies With A Total Of 37,243 Chinese Hdps Were Included. All Included Studies Were Conducted In Heroin Detoxification Settings. Only Two Studies Were Rated As High Quality. The Pooled Prevalence Of Dsh In Chinese Hdps Was 4.4% (95%Ci: 2.9, 6.2%), But The Heterogeneity Of Prevalence Rates Across Studies Was Significant (I2 = 98%, P < 0.001). Studies Rated As High Quality Had Significantly Higher Prevalence Of Dsh Than Those Rated As Low Quality (13.2 Vs. 3.4%, P < 0.001). Swallowing Foreign Objects Was The Most Common Method Of Dsh, With A Combined Prevalence Of 2.7% (95%Ci: 1.6, 4.4%). Extreme Dsh Methods Such As Cutting Offfingers And Jumping From Height Were Also Not Uncommon In This Patient Population. Conclusion: Due To Methodological Problems In Available Studies, We Find A Relatively Low Prevalence Of Dsh Among Chinese Hdps Receiving Detoxification Treatment. Nevertheless, The Self-Harmers Of Chinese Hdps Are More Likely To Harm Themselves In A Dangerous Or Life-Threatening Way. Restricting The Availability Of Dsh Methods May Be An Effective Way To Prevent Or Reduce Dsh In China'S Detoxification Treatment Settings. © 2018 Zhong, Xu, Xie, Chen And Lu.",,False,,False,,,,,,False,

Diagnosis And Treatment Options For Ep Are Limited ...,"BACKGROUND: Esophageal perforation (EP) is a lethal surgical emergency that needs to be diagnosed and treated immediately.
Diagnosis and treatment options for EP are limited due to its lower incidence. There are scoring systems proposed for this purpose;
however, they cannot be applied to every patient. The recent trend in the treatment of EP is toward the non-operative approach over the
surgical treatment methods. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate our treatment methods and outcomes in patients with EP.
METHODS: Thirteen patients with EP treated in our clinic between 2013 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. The Pittsburgh
Perforation Severity Score (PSS), systemic condition status, and ClavienDindo Classification (CDC) score were assessed, and treatment
methods were reviewed. Their effects on morbidity and mortality were examined using Fishers exact test and biserial correlation test.
RESULTS: A total of 13 patients (six males and seven females; median age 64 years) were included in the study. Ten patients were
managed non-operative, and three were treated surgically. Of the 10 patients, two had additional surgery after non-operative manage-
ment. The PSS, systemic condition status, CDC score, duration of stay in the hospital, time to diagnosis, presence of hypotension, and
being in shock were strongly correlated with mortality (p<0.05). The PSS, CDC score, and stay in the intensive care unit were strongly
correlated with morbidity (p<0.05). The comparison between the non-operative and operative groups did not yield a statistically
significant difference in mortality and morbidity.
CONCLUSION: Even if the scoring systems help to understand the severity of the condition, they are inadequate to determine the
treatment option. Early diagnosis and treatment are the most important steps in management. Operative and non-operative treatment
options are not superior to each other, but their complementary use will be more beneficial for the patients.

Endoscopic methods [endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)] are useful tools to diagnose and manage
chronic pancreatitis. Pediatric knowledge and use of these modalities is
limited and warrants dissemination.
Methods: Literature review of publications relating to use of ERCP and EUS
for diagnosis and/or management of chronic pancreatitis with special attention
to studies involving 018 years old subjects was conducted with summaries
generated. Recommendations were developed and voted upon by authors.
Results: Both EUS and ERCP can be used even in small children to assist in
diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in cases where cross-sectional imaging is
not sufficient to diagnose or characterize the disease. Children under 15 kg
for EUS and 10 kg for ERCP can be technically challenging. These
procedures should be done optimally by appropriately trained endoscopists
and adult gastroenterology providers with appropriate experience treating
children. EUS and ERCP-related risks both include perforation, bleeding and
pancreatitis. EUS is the preferred diagnostic modality over ERCP because of
lower complication rates overall. Both modalities can be used for management
of chronic pancreatitis -related fluid collections. ERCP has successfully been
used to manage pancreatic duct stones.
Conclusion: EUS and ERCP can be safely used to diagnose chronic pancreatitis
in pediatric patients and assist in management of chronic pancreatitis-related
complications. Procedure-related risks are similar to those seen in adults, with
EUS having a safer risk profile overall. The recent increase in pediatric-trained
specialists will improve access of these modalities for children.",False,,,,,,,,False,

The Purpose Of This Study Was To Evaluate Findings At Serial Mri After Endoscopic Removal Of A Button Battery From The Esophagus In A Series Of  Pediatric Patients. Materials And Methods. Serial Mri Examinations After Removal  Of A Button Battery From The Esophagus Were Reviewed Retrospectively For The  Presence Of Mediastinal Edema; Imaging Characteristics Of The Aorta And Arteries;  Imaging Characteristics Of The Trachea; And Imaging Characteristics Of The  Esophageal Wall At The Level Of Injury. Results. A Total Of 48 Mri Examinations  Were Performed On 19 Patients, 89% (17/19) In The First 48 Hours After Battery  Removal. Serial Mri Was Performed For 84% (16/19) Of Patients. Initial Mri Showed  Extensive Mediastinal Edema In All 17 Patients Who Underwent Mri In The First 48  Hours. Edema Directly Abutted Major Arteries In All 17 Patients And Abutted The  Airway In All 10 Patients With Proximal Esophageal Injury. Arterial Vascular  Changes Were Seen In 30% (3/10) Of Patients With Proximal Esophageal Injury And  57% (4/7) Of Patients With Mid Or Distalesophageal Injury. Airway Changes Were  Seen In 80% (8/10) Of Patients With Proximal Esophageal Injury.

If The Bolus Does Not Pass Spontaneously, Then The Patient Is At Risk Of Aspiration, Dehydration, Perforation, And Death. Definitive Management Is With Endoscopic Intervention, Recommended Within 24 Hours. Prior To Endoscopy, Many Patients Undergo A Period Of Observation, Awaiting Spontaneous Disimpaction, Or May Undergo Enteral Or Parenteral Treatments To Attempt To Dislodge The Bolus. There Is Little Consensus As To Which Of These Conservative Strategies Is Safe And Effective To Be Used In This Initial Period, Before Resorting To Definitive Endoscopic Management For Persistent Impaction. Objectives To Evaluate The Efficacy Of Non‐Endoscopic Conservative Treatments In The Management Of Soft Food Boluses Impacted Within The Oesophagus. Search Methods We Searched The Following Databases, Using Relevant Search Terms: Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials (Central), Medline, Embase And Cinahl. The Date Of The Search Was 18 August 2019. We Screened The Reference Lists Of Relevant Studies And Reviews On The Topic To Identify Any Additional Studies. Selection Criteria We Included Randomised Controlled Trials Of The Management Of Acute Oesophageal Soft Food Bolus Impaction, In Adults And Children, Reporting The Incidence Of Disimpaction (Confirmed Radiologically Or Clinically By Return To Oral Diet) Without The Need For Endoscopic Intervention. We Did Not Include Studies Focusing On Sharp Or Solid Object Impaction. Data Collection And Analysis We Used Standard Methodological Procedures Recommended By Cochrane. Main Results We Identified 890 Unique Records Through The Electronic Searches. We Excluded 809 Clearly Irrelevant Records And Retrieved 81 Records For Further Assessment. We Subsequently Included One Randomised Controlled Trial That Met The Eligibility Criteria, Which Was Conducted In Four Swedish Centres And Randomised 43 Participants To Receive Either Intravenous Diazepam Followed By Glucagon, Or Intravenous Placebos. The Effect Of The Active Substances Compared With Placebo On Rates Of Disimpaction Without Intervention Is Uncertain, As The Numbers From This Single Study Were Small, And The Rates Were Similar (38% Versus 32%; Risk Ratio 1.19, 95% Confidence Interval 0.51 To 2.75, P = 0.69). The Certainty Of The Evidence Using Grade For This Outcome Is Low. Data On Adverse Events Were Lacking. Authors' Conclusions There Is Currently Inadequate Data To Recommend The Use Of Any Enteral Or Parenteral Treatments In The Management Of Acute Oesophageal Soft Food Bolus Impaction. There Is Also Inadequate Data Regarding Potential Adverse Events From The Use Of These Treatments, Or From Potential Delays In Definitive Endoscopic Management. Caution Should Be Exercised When Using Any Conservative Management Strategies In These Patients. Plain Language Summary Use Of Treatments To Dislodge Soft Foods Stuck Between The Throat And The Stomach To Try To Avoid The Need For An Endoscopy Review Question Can A Period Of Observation, Treatment With Swallowed Substances, Or Treatment With Substances Given Via The Blood Help To Dislodge Soft Foods That Are Stuck Between The Throat And The Stomach In Order To Avoid The Need For An Endoscopic Procedure To Clear It? Background Food Can Sometimes Get Stuck In The Oesophagus, The Pipe Connecting The Throat To The Stomach That Passes Through The Chest. This Food Often Dislodges On Its Own, Without Any Medical Help, But Occasionally A Doctor'S Help Is Needed To Clear It. Removing Or Dislodging These Lumps Of Food Can Be Done Using A Flexible Camera Or A Rigid Instrument, Called An Endoscope, But Endoscopic Procedures Can Have Serious Complications, Like Causing Holes In The Oesophagus. However, Waiting For Too Long For The Food To Clear On Its Own Can Also Increase The Risk Of A Hole In The Oesophagus And May Lead To Saliva Or Food Falling Into The Lungs, Causing Serious Infections. A Variety Of Treatments Are Currently Used To Try To Clear The Food, Without Having To Resort To An Endoscopy, Many Of Which Also Have Potential Side Effects, Including Difficulty Breathing, Increased Blood Sugar Levels, Low Blood Pressure, And Irregular Heartbeat. We Wanted To Know If Any Of These Treatments Were Better Than Simply Waiting For The Food To Clear On Its Own, Before Trying To Dislodge It With Instruments. Study Characteristics The Evidence Is Current To August 2019. We Found One Trial Suitable To Answer Our Question, Which Compared Giving A Patient Two Drugs Into A Vein In (Diazepam And Glucagon) To Placebos (Clear Liquids Which Appeared Similar To The Drugs But Have No Effect On The Body). We Did Not Look At Treating Sharp Or Hard Objects, As These Are Treated Differently. Key Results There Was Not Enough Evidence To Say With Certainty Which Treatments For Food Impacted In The Oesophagus Are Safe Or Effective.

Patients And Methods: This Retrospective Study Included 21 Adults With Both Sides Of Sharp-Pointed Fbs Embedded Into The Duodenal Wall Who Were Admitted To The Second Xiangya Hospital In China Between January 1, 1996, And May 31, 2021. Data Associated With The Endoscopic Removal Of These Fbs Were Collected From The Electronic Medical Record System (Emrs) Of The Hospital. Results: The Incidence Rate Of Duodenal Total Fbs And Fbs Embedded In Both Sides Was 8.87% And 1.03%, Respectively. The Success Rate Of Endoscopic Treatment Was 100.00% In 124 Patients Without Embedded Duodenal Fbs And 97.14% In 35 Patients With One Side Embedded Duodenal Fbs. Of The 21 Patients With Fbs Embedded In Both Sides Of The Duodenal Wall, Endoscopic Removal Was Successful In 85.71% Of Patients, Whereas 14.29% Required Surgery. Fbs Removed From These Patients Included Toothpicks In 12; Needles In 3; Jujube Pits In 2; And A Chopstick, Dentures, Fish Bones, And Chicken Bones In One Each. Most Of These 21 Fbs Were Located In The Bulb And Descending Duodenum, Followed By The Third Part Of Duodenum. Conclusion: Sharp-Edged Fbs With Both Sides Embedded In The Duodenal Wall Are Rare. Endoscopic Removal May Be Considered As A Feasible, Safe, And Effective Method Of Removing Sharp-Pointed Fbs With Both Sides Embedded In The Duodenal Wall. And If Endoscopic Removal Is Unsuccessful, Surgical Management Can Be A Secondary Option.",,False,,,,,,,,False,

pecially; if the victim is a child. Infants and children are the most commonly seen victims, ingestion is often intentional, unlike
adults, who constitute a small proportion of victims and ingestion is often accidental. The number of foreign bodies found at
the emergency units of many hospitals is quite large. These include coins, safety pins, sewing needles, button batteries and nuts.
However, many of the foreign bodies are excreted safely without any untoward events, except for foreign bodies with sharp
ends, containing toxic chemicals and where there is a pre-existing anatomical abnormality in the gastro-Intestinal Tract (GIT).
Foreign bodies, especially those with sharp ends are prone to getting arrested, inflicting mucosal erosion or even perforating any
part of the GIT, particularly at the site of physiologic or anatomic constrictions. These areas are the three Oesophageal anatomic
narrowing, the pylorus, Ileo-Caecal valve and the recto-sigmoid junction. Most foreign bodies can be seen on plain radiograph,
removal, where indicated, can be done endoscopically or through an open surgery. But, majority can be managed expectantly,
aided by patience, careful serial radiographic monitoring and perhaps use of lubricating solutions like liquid paraffin.

Background: Foreign body (FB) in the aerodigestive tract presents more commonly in children and remains a surgical emergency with potential for fatal complications.

Objectives: To describe management and outcomes of aerodigestive FB managed at University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH) and proffer preventive measures.

Methods: A 9-year retrospective review of all patients with foreign body in the aerodigestive tract managed between March 2011 and July 2020.

Results: Sixty-six patients were studied. Median age was 9years with M:F ratio =1.6:1. FB was ingested in 38(57.6%) patients, aspiration occurred in 28(42.4%). Denture was most common FB 20(30.3%); plastic whistle/valve placed in dolls or football accounted for 4(6.1%). When ingested, FB was impacted in cervical 17(44.7%), upper thoracic 10(26.3%) and middle thoracic 2(5.3%) oesophagus. Oesophagoscopy was used in 30(8.9%) for retrieval. When aspirated, FB was located in the right bronchus 10(35.7%), left bronchus 7(25.0%), hypopharynx and trachea 2(7.1%) each, and cricopharynx 1(3.5%); no FB was found in 3(10.7%) patients. Direct Laryngoscopy was the method of retrieval in 3(10.1%) patients while others had rigid bronchoscopy. Mortality rate was 1.5%.

Mostly Fbs Are Found Ingested Accidently Or Intentionally In Children And Adults With Mental  Status Alterations. Depending On The Type Of Object, Different Complications Can  Occur. There Exist Numerous Methods For Removing Each Specific Fb. Fortunately,  Most Fbs Tend To Move Uneventfully Through The Gastrointestinal Tract Without Any  Intervention; But Managing Some Foreign Objects Can Be Difficult And Lead To  Severe Complications. Endoscopy Helps With The Diagnosis And Treatment Of These  Cases, But The Time Of The Management Plays An Important Role. Case Presentation:  A 26-Year-Old Female Who Intentionally Swallowed Two Sewing Needles, Presented To  Our Emergency Department With Abdominal Pain Two Months After The Fb Ingestion.  One Of The Sewing Needles Was Spontaneously Excreted Through The Bowel, And The  Other Was Present In Her Body For Two Months. The Fb Had Penetrated The Stomach  And Migrated To The Peritoneal Cavity. The Patient'S Condition Was Managed By  Laparoscopic Removal Of The Fb And Repair Of The Damaged Tissue.

In the United States, 1500 people die yearly from ingested foreign bodies. The leading cause of mortality is obstruction and perforation due to impaction in the gastrointestinal system. In this study, we evaluated the clinical findings, risk factors, and clinical output data of foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract and presented the most accurate approach considering the literature. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective and descriptive study analyzing data from a prospective database. Adult patients admitted to the emergency department of our 3<sup>rd</sup> level university hospital between January 2015 and January 2022 due to foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract were included in the study. Results: Transanal rectal body removal in the operating room was performed using the Crede maneuver in seven patients. Laparotomy or thoracotomy was performed in nine patients, and thirty-six patients were treated with endoscopic methods. Endoscopy and laparotomy were performed simultaneously in one patient. It was determined that the foreign body of 29 patients was removed by conservative methods. Conclusion: For treating of foreign bodies, a multidisciplinary approach, including advanced endoscopic and surgery, is required according to the localization and content of the foreign body, underlying cause and patient population.",False,,,,,,,,False,

Adolescents And Young Adults May Carry Out This Act To Hurt Themselves Or Even Suicide. Often, Most Reports Related To Deliberate Swallowing Are Typically Either Surgical Or Gastrointestinal And Rarely Are Found In Psychiatric Articles; More Often, The Swallowed Foreign Objects (80 - 90%) Are Disposed Of Spontaneously, And 10 - 20% Of Them Require Endoscopy For More Study And Less Than 1% Of Them Need Surgery To Be Removed Or Its Complications. Case Presentation: The Presented Patient Is A 17-Year-Old Girl Admitted To The Psychosomatic Ward Of Afzalipour Hospital Due To Intentional Poisoning. During The Year Before Her Admission, On Three Separate Occasions, She Detached The Knife Blade From Its Haft And Swallowed It. She Underwent Laparotomy Twice, One Time For Sigmoid Tearing And Damage To The Left Ovary, To Remove The Knife And Regeneration Of The Left Ovary And Sigmoid, And Another Time To Remove The Knife In Order Not To Cause Damage To Her Intestines. To Our Knowledge, This Is The First Reported Case In The World In Which An Ovary Has Been Damaged. Further Investigation Into Her Background Shows Some Extent Of Privation Due To Her Family’S Long-Term Economic Problems And Instability; Moreover, Sexual And Physical Abuse Was Also Confirmed. The Patient Was Prescribed Clozapine, Which Decreased Her Suicidal Behavior And Attempts Noticeably. Conclusions: Swallowing Foreign Bodies In This Patient Is Interpreted As Both Self-Punishment And Punishing Others (Those Who Thought They Were Hurt Or May Be Blamed For Their Despair Or Rejection). Intentional Swallowing Of Foreign Objects Behavior Is More Resistant Than Other Self-Harming Activities And May Have A Worse Prognosis. Swallowing Foreign Objects Requires A Sophisticated Process That, If Not Correctly Managed, May Result In Serious Complications; Therefore, Appropriate Psychiatric Counseling And Supportive Treatment Are Necessary For These Patients. Specific To This Patient Eliminating The Effects Of Suicide And Reaching Medical Stability With A Short Admission Was Necessary. Her Suicidal Behavior And Attempts Decreased Significantly After Starting Clozapine Treatment. Therefore, Clozapine Treatment Is Recommended For Patients With Suicidal Behavior And Self-Harm. © 2023, Brieflands. All Rights Reserved.",,False,,,,,,,,False,

Abstract Foreign Body Ingestion [Fbi] Is Rare In Adults As Compared With Children [1]. Foreign Body Ingestion Is Accidental In 95 Percent Of Cases And Is Usually Related To Food [Fish, ...","1. Abstract
Foreign body ingestion [FBI] is rare in adults as compared with
children [1]. Foreign body ingestion is accidental in 95 percent
of cases and is usually related to food [fish, chicken bones, tooth-
picks][2]. Foreign body ingestion in adults occur more frequently
in older adults, in indivuduals with underlying psychiatric diseases
or alcohol intoxification, in prison inmates, and for the purpose of
drug trafficking.[3] Most [80 to 90%] ingested foreign bodies pass
without the need of intervention [4]. Endoscopic intervention is
required in 10 to 20 percent of patients; the urgency for endoscopy
depends on the underlying clinical scenario and the nature of im-
pactation [food versus foreign body] [5]. In some cases, endosco-
py can be avoid if a radiograph immediately prior to the procedure
reveals that the foreign body has passed [6]. Surgical intervention
is required in less than 1 percent [7]. We present the case of a
29-year-old patient with borderline personality disorder who came
to the emergency room of our hospital referred from her psychi-
atric center due to ingestion of several foreign bodies [domino
pieces]. After radiological verification and rejecting endoscopic
treatment by the on-call endoscopist, urgent surgical intervention
was decided to resolve the problem.",False,,,,,,,,False,

Previous Data On The Topic Predominantly Comprises ...,"Carotid complications resulting from extra-luminal migration of ingested foreign bodies (FB) are rare but potentially
life-threatening. Previous data on the topic predominantly comprises isolated case reports, leaving a gap in compre-
hensive evidence necessary to guide clinical decision-making. In this article, we offer a narrative review alongside a
novel case report, aimed at providing a broad, evidence-based perspective on the topic to guide clinical practice. The
search strategy employed keywords related to carotid artery complications from ingested FB across the following elec-
tronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Central.
Screening involved standardized data extraction by two independent reviewers, with a focus on abstracts meeting inclu-
sion criteria and excluding non-English literature and non-relevant studies from further analysis. Moreover, we present
a novel case report on the topic that was successfully managed using a unique surgical approach.
Overall, a total of sixteen case reports were finally included, data on clinical presentations, diagnostic strategies and
findings, surgical management and outcome were extracted, tabulated, and discussed.
In carotid complications from extra-luminal migration of ingested FB, high clinical suspicion is crucial due to potentially
mild symptoms and negative first-level examinations. Computed tomography (CT) scan plays a pivotal role for accurate
diagnosis and surgical planning, along with neck ultrasound to detect complications. Tailored surgical strategies based
on the severity of carotid involvement, including venous patch grafts in severe vessels involvement, are crucial for op-
timal patient outcomes. As a novelty, in our case report, carotid shunt was successfully employed instead of prolonged
carotid clamping to reduce the risk of associated neurological sequelae. It could be concluded that diagnosis and man-
aging carotid complications from extra-luminal migration of ingested FB remains challenging and a multidisciplinary
approach is warranted.",False,,,,,,,,False,

Pediatric Gastroenterologists And Surgeons Were  Increasingly Tasked With Removing These Problematic Objects. The Purpose Of This  Study Was To Assess The Utility Of Single-Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (Sils) In  The Management Of Ingested Magnets. Patients And Methods: This Is A  Single-Center, Retrospective Assessment Of Surgical Interventions For Ingested  Magnets. International Classification Of Disease, 10Th Revision Codes Were Used  To Identify 349 Patients ≤21 Years Of Age Evaluated For Foreign Body Ingestion  Over A 4.5-Year Period. A Medical Record Review Helped Isolate 29 (8.3%) Magnet  Ingestions, 9 Requiring Surgical Intervention. Redcap Was Used For Analysis.  Results: Of 9 Surgical Patients, 7 Underwent Sils Intervention By 1 Surgeon.  Another Surgeon Performed An Open Operation, Whereas A Third Performed A  Multiport Operation. Of The 7 Sils Cases, 3 Were Completed Without Conversion To  Open. In One Of These Cases, Bowel Resection With Primary Anastomosis Was  Performed. For Sils Cases, Average Operating Room Time Was 109 Minutes (38-170  Minutes), Time To Enteral Feeds Was 23 Hours (0.28-79.2 Hours), And Hospital  Length Of Stay (Los) Was 3.8 Days (1.96-6.68 Days). Thirty-Day Readmission For  Sils Was 14.3%. No Other Complications Were Observed. Conclusions: Sils Has Been  Safely Utilized For Magnet Retrieval. It Offers An Ability To Identify The  Affected Intestinal Segment And An Opportunity To Intervene Extracorporeally  Through An Uncapped Port. In Addition, Knowing Where Matted Bowel Is Located Can  Direct A Limited Incision During Conversion To Laparotomy. This May Confer  Benefits Of Decreased Pain, Shortened Time To Enteral Feeds, And Decreased  Hospital Los.",,False,,,,,,,,False,

Purpose: To Evaluate The  Potential Value Of Computed Tomography (Ct) In Guiding The Selection Of Surgical  Treatment For Patients With Ingested Foreign Bodies In The Lower Gastrointestinal  Tract. Methods: Between January 2014 And December 2023, We Analyzed The Data Of  58 Patients (Median Age: 65.4 Years; Range, 31-96 Years) With Ingested Foreign  Bodies In The Lower Gastrointestinal Tract Who Underwent Ct Examinations.  Patients Were Treated Either Conservatively (35 Cases) Or Surgically (23 Cases).  The Angle Between The Long Axis Of The Foreign Body And The Intestinal Canal  (Fb-Ic Angle) Was Measured. Ct Findings And Clinical Variables Were Evaluated To  Identify Potential Indicators For Surgical Treatment Through Univariate And  Multivariate Logistic Regression Analyses. Results: Univariate Analysis Revealed  The Fb-Ic Angle (P = 0.002), Presence Of Free Peritoneal Gas (P = 0.002), White  Blood Cell Count (P = 0.018), And Neutrophil Count (P = 0.007) As Significant  Factors Associated With Surgical Treatment. Multivariate Analysis Demonstrated  That The Fb-Ic Angle (Odds Ratio, 1.033; P = 0.045) And The Presence Of Free  Peritoneal Gas (Odds Ratio, 41.335; P = 0.002) Are Independent Indicators For  Surgical Management. The Fb-Ic Angle Showed An Area Under The Receiver Operating  Characteristic Curve Of 0.755, With A Cutoff Value Of 51.25 Degrees.
