Patients: Nine Patients Presenting With Aef Were Observed Between May 1988 And April 2002. There Were 4 Men And 5 Women With A Mean Age Of 54.3 Years (Range, 32-77 Years). Six Patients Presented Secondary Aef After Aortic Repair. Two Patients Presented Primary Aef After Rupture Of An Atherosclerotic Aneurysm Into The Esophagus. In The Remaining Patient, Aef Was Caused By Swallowing A Fishbone. In 6 Cases Involving True Aef With A Direct Communication Between The Aorta And Esophagus, Massive Exsanguinating Hematemesis Occurred. It Was Usually Preceded By Minor Sentinel Bleeding, Two Patients Presented Esophagoparaprosthetic Fistula (Eppf). One Patient Presented Primary Aef That Was Contained By A Large Thrombus In The Communication. The Clinical Picture In These 3 Patients Involved Severe Sepsis Without Hemorrhage. Results: Two Patients Died As A Result Of Massive Hemorrhage Before Assessment And Surgical Treatment Could Be Undertaken. One 77-Year-Old Woman Presenting Eppf Refused To Undergo Surgery And Died Because Of Infection. The Remaining 6 Patients Underwent Surgical Treatment With Various Outcomes. One Man Died During Thoracotomy Caused By Exsanguinating Hemorrhage. One Woman Presenting Eppf Was Treated By Exclusion Followed By Ascending Aorta To Abdominal Aorta Bypass Grafting, Removal Of The Prosthesis, Esophageal Exclusion, And Directed Esophageal Fistula. She Died Of Infection. The Other 4 Patients Were Treated By In Situ Aortic Allograft Replacement. The Damaged Esophagus Was Repaired By Using The Tha1 Technique In 1 Patient. In The Remaining 3 Cases Subtotal Esophagectomy Was Performed In Association With Cervical Esophagostomy, Ligation Of The Abdominal Esophagus, Gastrostomy, And Jejunostomy. One Patient Died Of Sepsis During The First 24 Hours After The Operation. The Other 3 Patients Underwent Secondary Esophagoplasty And Survived With No Further Sign Of Infection. Mean Duration Of Follow-Up In The Survivor Group Was 53 Months (Range, 15-95 Months). Overall 6 Patients, Including 3 That Did Not Undergo Surgical Treatment, Died And 3 Patients Survived. Conclusion: Our Experience Confirms That Aef Is A Rare But Catastrophic Disorder. In Situ Allograft Replacement Usually In Association With Subtotal Esophagectomy Appears To Be An Excellent Salvage Modality Whenever Emergency Surgery Is Feasible.",,,

METHODS: For children under 15 years, all Victorian public hospital admissions, July 1987 to June 1995, due to asphyxiation or 'foreign body entering through other orifice' (which includes ingestions), were reviewed. Emergency department presentations due to asphyxiation and foreign body ingestion provided information on circumstances of, and the type of foreign bodies involved in the injuries. RESULTS: The childhood average annual admission rate for asphyxiation was 15.1 per 100,000. Food related asphyxiation peaked in infants under 1 year, and declined to low levels by 3 years. The main foods involved were nuts, carrot, apple, and candy. The rate of non-food related asphyxiation was relatively constant to 3 years of age and then declined by 6 years. Mechanical suffocation was less common. The annual admission rate for 'foreign body entering through other orifice' was 31.7 per 100,000. These injuries peaked in 2-3 year olds then gradually declined. About 80% of these foreign body admissions were ingestions, with coins being the major object ingested. Admission rates for these causes remained constant over the eight years. Asphyxiation resulted in a higher proportion admitted and longer hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of suffocation and strangulation needs to focus on a safe sleeping environment and avoidance of ropes and cords, while foreign body asphyxiation and ingestion needs a focus on education of parents and child carers regarding age, appropriate food, risk of play with coins, and other small items. Legislation for toy small parts could be extended to those used by children up to the age of 5 years, and to other products marketed for children. Design changes and warning labels also have a place in prevention.",,

Whilst Resorbable Plates Appear To Offer Clinical Advantages Over Metal Plates In Orthognathic Surgery, Concerns Remain About The Stability Of Fixation And The Length Of Time Required For Their Degradation And The Possibility Of Foreign Body Reactions. This Review Compares The Use Of Titanium Versus Bioresorbable Plates In Orthognathic Surgery And Is An Update Of The Cochrane Review First Published In 2007. Objectives To Compare The Effects Of Bioresorbable Fixation Systems With Titanium Systems Used During Orthognathic Surgery. Search Methods Cochrane Oral Health'S Information Specialist Searched The Following Databases: Cochrane Oral Health'S Trials Register (To 20 January 2017); The Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials (Central; 2016, Issue 11) In The Cochrane Library (Searched 20 January 2017); Medline Ovid (1946 To 20 January 2017); And Embase Ovid (1980 To 20 January 2017). We Searched The Us National Institutes Of Health Ongoing Trials Register Clinicaltrials.Gov ( Clinicaltrials.Gov ; Searched 20 January 2017), And The  World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform  (Searched 20 January 2017) For Ongoing Trials. No Restrictions Were Placed On The Language Or Date Of Publication When Searching The Electronic Databases. Selection Criteria Randomised Controlled Trials Comparing Bioresorbable Versus Titanium Fixation Systems Used For Orthognathic Surgery In Adults. Data Collection And Analysis Two Review Authors Independently Screened The Results Of The Electronic Searches, Extracted Data And Assessed The Risk Of Bias Of The Included Studies. We Resolved Disagreement By Discussion. Clinical Heterogeneity Between The Included Trials Precluded Pooling Of Data, And Only A Descriptive Summary Is Presented. Main Results This Review Included Two Trials, Involving 103 Participants, One Comparing Titanium With Resorbable Plates And Screws And The Other Titanium With Resorbable Screws. Both Studies Were At High Risk Of Bias And Provided Very Limited Data For The Primary Outcomes Of This Review. All Participants In One Trial Suffered Mild To Moderate Postoperative Discomfort With No Statistically Significant Difference Between The Two Plating Groups At Different Follow‐Up Times. Mean Scores Of Patient Satisfaction Were 7.43 To 8.63 (Range 0 To 10) With No Statistically Significant Difference Between The Two Groups Throughout Follow‐Up. Adverse Effects Reported In One Study Were Two Plate Exposures In Each Group Occurring Between The Third And Ninth Months. Plate Exposures Occurred Mainly In The Posterior Maxillary Region, Except For One Titanium Plate Exposure In The Mandibular Premolar Region. Known Causes Of Infection Were Associated With Loosened Screws And Wound Dehiscence With No Statistically Significant Difference In The Infection Rate Between Titanium (3/196), And Resorbable (3/165) Plates. Authors' Conclusions We Do Not Have Sufficient Evidence To Determine If Titanium Plates Or Resorbable Plates Are Superior For Fixation Of Bones After Orthognathic Surgery. This Review Provides Insufficient Evidence To Show Any Difference In Postoperative Pain And Discomfort, Level Of Patient Satisfaction, Plate Exposure Or Infection For Plate And Screw Fixation Using Either Titanium Or Resorbable Materials. Plain Language Summary Resorbable Versus Titanium Plates For Corrective Jaw Surgery Review Question Are Resorbable (Biodegradable) Plates Better Than Titanium (Metal) Plates For The Fixation Of Facial Bones After Corrective (Orthognathic) Jaw Surgery? Background Under‐ Or Overgrowth Of One Or Both Of The Jaw Bones Can Lead To Reduced Function And An Unattractive Facial Appearance, Either Of Which May Have Lasting And Significant Psychosocial Effects. Treatment Of Severe Cases May Require A Combination Of Orthodontic Appliances And Orthognathic (Corrective Jaw) Surgery. After Surgery The Cut Bone Needs To Be Immobilised To Ensure That Optimal Healing Takes Place. Titanium Plates Used For Fixation Are Recognised To Be The 'Gold Standard' But Recent Developments In Biomaterials Have Led To An Increased Use Of Bioresorbable Plates Or Screws For Corrective Jaw Surgery. The Use Of Bioresorbable Plates For The Fixation Of Facial Bones Might Appear To Reduce The Need For A Further Operation For The Removal Of Metal Plates. However, Whilst Resorbable Plates Do Appear To Offer Certain Advantages Over Metal Plates, Concerns Remain About The Stability Of Fixation, The Length Of Time Required For Their Resorption (Being Reabsorbed), The Possibility Of Foreign Body Reactions, And With Some Of The Technical Difficulties Experienced With Resorbable Plates. Study Characteristics We Included Two Studies That Analysed A Total Of 103 Participants. The Evidence In This Review Is Up To Date As Of 20 January 2017. Study Participants Were Adults Older Than 16 Years Of Age. One Study Compared Titanium With Resorbable Plates And Screws And The Other Titanium With Resorbable Screws. One Study Was Conducted In China, The Other In Germany. Key Results Both Studies Were At High Risk Of Bias And Provided Very Limited Data. We Do Not Have Sufficient Evidence To Determine If Titanium Plates Or Resorbable Plates Are Superior For The Fixation Of Bones After Corrective Jaw Surgery. This Review Provides Insufficient Evidence To Show Any Difference In Postoperative Pain And Discomfort, Level Of Patient Satisfaction, Plate Exposure Or Infection For Plate And Screw Fixation Using Either Titanium Or Resorbable Materials. Quality Of The Evidence Both Included Studies Were Assessed As Being At High Risk Of Bias And The Very Limited And Weak Evidence Was Of Very Low Quality.",,,

Therefore, It Is Important That Radiologists Be Aware Of This Commonly Encountered Entity. Attempted Suicide May Take A Variety Of Forms; Those Discussed By The Authors Include Sharp Force Injury, Immolation And Inhalation, Ingestion, Hanging, Firearm Use, Jumping From A Height, And Drowning. Certain Radiologic Findings Are Commonly Seen In Cases Of Attempted Suicide And Other Self-Injurious Behaviors. In Some Cases, Especially When The Patient Is Unconscious Or Is Unwilling To Provide A History, It May Not Be Apparent That Suicide Has Been Attempted Until Characteristic Imaging Findings Are Recognized. Correct Identification Of Suicide Attempts On The Basis Of Such Findings Will Ensure That These Patients Receive Appropriate Psychiatric Treatment. When A Suicide Attempt Is Unsuccessful, It Is Important To Be Familiar With The Complications That May Contribute To Delayed Mortality And Morbidity. The Radiologist Plays An Integral Role In The Acute Medical Or Surgical Management Of Patients Who Have Attempted Suicide. In Addition, Imaging Examinations May Provide Useful Forensic Information.

The purpose of the study was to assess the percentage of patients in whom urgent endoscopic investigation revealed true foreign bodies in the upper GIT and to evaluate the success of emergency endoscopic procedures. Methods: The study includes patients in whom urgent endoscopic investigations of the upper GIT were performed in the period 1 January 1994 to 1 May 2008. Results: 8552 patients were investigated, average age 60.6 years (SD17.1 years, range 1106 years), with 3276 (38 %) females and 5276 males (62 %). In 69 patients (0.8 %), true foreign bodies were detected in the esophagus or stomach. In these patients a total of 90 endoscopic investigations were performed: in 65/69 patients (94.2%) the foreign bodies were removed endoscopically; in 4 (5.8 %) cases the endoscopic procedures were unsuccessful. Among the foreign bodies removed were a variety metal or plastic objects, such as coins, keys, screws, hooks, batteries, razor blades, needles, lighters, buttons, and parts of kitchen, toilet or writing utensils. In patients with successful endoscopic removal of the objects, no significant complications were noted. In 4 patients (4/69, 5.8 %) mild hemorrhages from the region of the esophagogastric junction were observed. Conclusion: Endoscopic technologies allow successful removal of a variety of types of foreign bodies from the upper GIT. ",,

These 5 Patients Were Recruited Into The Larger Study  Within 11 Days Of Injury And Showed A Penetration Path For The Projectile That  Engaged The Upper Aerodigestive Tract. All Subjects Were Recruited From Patients  Presenting For Care Of Their Gunshot Injuries To A Large Inner-City Trauma Center  With A Retained Bullet Resulting From A Gunshot Injury. An Initial Blood Lead  Level Was Measured For All Recruited Patients And Repeated 1 To 17 Weeks Later.  Medical History Was Taken Along With A Screening And Risk Factor Questionnaire To  Determine Other Potential Or Actual Sources (Occupational/Recreational) Of Lead  Exposure. (109)Cd K-Shell X-Ray Fluorescence Determinations Of Bone Lead Were  Completed To Determine Past Lead Exposure Not Revealed By Medical History And  Risk Factor Questionnaire. Radiographs Taken Of The Abdomen And Chest, Required  As A Part Of The Patient'S Hospital Care, Were Retrospectively Reviewed For Signs  Of Metallic Fragments Along The Aerodigestive Tract. Results: All 5 Patients  Retained Multiple Lead Pellets Or Fragments At The Site Of Injury, Sustained  Fractures Of The Facial Bones, And Showed Increases In Blood Lead. Three Of The 5  Study Subjects Who Sustained Maxillofacial Gunshot Injuries Involving The Mouth,  Nose, Or Throat Region Showed Metallic Densities Along The Gastrointestinal Tract  Indicative Of Ingested Bullet Fragments. Each Patient With Ingested Bullet  Fragments Showed Rapid Elevation Of Blood Lead Exceeding 25 Microg/Dl And  Sustained Increases Well Beyond The Time When All Ingested Fragments Were  Eliminated. A 3-Year Follow-Up On These 3 Patients Showed Significantly Sustained  Elevation Of Blood Lead But Less Than That Observed During The Initial 6 Months  After Injury. None Of The 5 Study Subjects Showed Any Evidence Of Metallic  Foreign Bodies Within The Tracheobronchial Regions Indicative Of Aspiration.  Conclusion: Ingestion Of Lead Fragments Can Result From Gunshot Injuries To The  Maxillofacial Region And May Substantially Contribute To A Rapid Increase In  Blood Lead Level. Prompt Diagnosis And Elimination Of Ingested Lead Fragments Are  Essential Steps Necessary To Prevent Lead Being Absorbed From The  Gastrointestinal Tract.

We examined an adult umbrella cockatoo (Cacatua alba) because of a 4-month history of weight loss and intermittent, dark brown, malodorous stool. Physical examination findings were unremarkable. Results of laboratory testing revealed anemia, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, monocytosis, hypoproteinemia, and hypoalbuminemia; blood lead and zinc concentrations were not elevated. Enterococcus durans was cultured aerobically from the feces. Gas-filled, dilated intestinal loops and a gas-filled proventriculus were evident on survey radiographs. The clinical signs did not resolve with initial treatment, which included ciprofloxacin, ketoconazole, and a lactobacillus supplement. Over the next 2 months, results of blood tests revealed nonregenerative anemia, intermittent leukocytosis, monocytosis, and hypoproteinemia. Staphylococcus lugdunensis and E faecium were isolated from a crop swab and fecal samples. A barium contrast study revealed a filling defect in the area of the large intestine, whereas results of fluoroscopy were normal. The cockatoo responded poorly to further treatment, including 5 days of supportive care in the hospital, and the owners requested euthanasia. On necropsy, a string foreign body (7 cm long) was found in the proximal large intestine. The string had originated from a rope toy in the bird's cage",,

life-threatening. Previous data on the topic predominantly comprises isolated case reports, leaving a gap in compre-
hensive evidence necessary to guide clinical decision-making. In this article, we offer a narrative review alongside a
novel case report, aimed at providing a broad, evidence-based perspective on the topic to guide clinical practice. The
search strategy employed keywords related to carotid artery complications from ingested FB across the following elec-
tronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Central.
Screening involved standardized data extraction by two independent reviewers, with a focus on abstracts meeting inclu-
sion criteria and excluding non-English literature and non-relevant studies from further analysis. Moreover, we present
a novel case report on the topic that was successfully managed using a unique surgical approach.
Overall, a total of sixteen case reports were finally included, data on clinical presentations, diagnostic strategies and
findings, surgical management and outcome were extracted, tabulated, and discussed.
In carotid complications from extra-luminal migration of ingested FB, high clinical suspicion is crucial due to potentially
mild symptoms and negative first-level examinations. Computed tomography (CT) scan plays a pivotal role for accurate
diagnosis and surgical planning, along with neck ultrasound to detect complications. Tailored surgical strategies based
on the severity of carotid involvement, including venous patch grafts in severe vessels involvement, are crucial for op-
timal patient outcomes. As a novelty, in our case report, carotid shunt was successfully employed instead of prolonged
carotid clamping to reduce the risk of associated neurological sequelae. It could be concluded that diagnosis and man-
aging carotid complications from extra-luminal migration of ingested FB remains challenging and a multidisciplinary
approach is warranted.",,

It Affects Millions Of International Travelers To Developing Countries Annually And Can Significantly Disrupt Travel Plans. Objective: To Provide An Update On The Evaluation, Diagnosis, Treatment, And Prevention Of Traveler'S Diarrhea. Methods: A Pubmed Search Was Completed In Clinical Queries Using The Key Term Traveler'S Diarrhea. The Search Strategy Included Meta-Analyses, Randomized Controlled Trials, Clinical Trials, Observational Studies, And Reviews. The Search Was Restricted To English Literature. Patents Were Searched Using The Key Term Traveler'S Diarrhea From Www.Freepatentsonline.Com. Results: Between 10% And 40% Of Travelers Develop Diarrhea. The Attack Rate Is Highest For Travelers From A Developed Country Who Visit A Developing Country. Children Are At Particular Risk. Travelers' Diarrhea Is Usually Acquired Through Ingestion Of Food And Water Contaminated By Feces. Most Cases Are Due To A Bacterial Pathogen, Commonly, Escherichia Coli, And Occur Within The First Few Days After Arrival In A Foreign Country. Dehydration Is The Most Common Complication. Pretravel Education On Hygiene And On The Safe Selection Of Food Items Is Important In Minimizing Episodes. For Mild Travelers' Diarrhea, The Use Of Antibiotic Is Not Recommended. The Use Of Bismuth Subsalicylate Or Loperamide May Be Considered. For Moderate Travelers' Diarrhea, Antibiotics Such As Fluoroquinolones, Azithromycin, And Rifaximin May Be Used. Loperamide May Be Considered As Monotherapy Or Adjunctive Therapy. For Severe Travelers' Diarrhea, Antibiotics Such As Azithromycin, Fluoroquinolones, And Rifaximin Should Be Used. Azithromycin Can Be Used Even For The Treatment Of Dysentery Whereas Fluoroquinolones And Rifaximin Cannot Be Used For Such Purpose. Recent Patents Related To The Management Of Travelers' Diarrhea Are Discussed. Conclusion: Although Travelers' Diarrhea Is Usually Self-Limited, Many Travelers Prefer Expedient Relief Of Diarrhea, Especially When They Are Traveling For Extended Periods By Air Or Ground. Judicious Use Of An Antimotility Agent And Antimicrobial Therapy Reduces The Duration And Severity Of Diarrhea.",,,

We prospectively evaluated 52 consecutive children who had swallowed coins to determine the incidence of asymptomatic esophageal coins and the rate of spontaneous passage. All patients had a roentgenogram; coins were removed from the esophagus if the patient was symptomatic. Children with asymptomatic esophageal coins were allowed less than 24 hours to pass the coin to the stomach. Thirty children had esophageal coins; of these, 9 (30%) were asymptomatic. The presence of symptoms was significantly associated with esophageal coins, but the absence of symptoms did not reliably exclude the possibility of an esophageal coin. All children who swallow coins should undergo roentgenographic evaluation.",,

in children, whereas the majority of adults will have neu-
rological dysfunction, trauma, alcohol abuse, or psycho-
logical disorders. 1 Much has been written about psychiat-
ric patients engaging in self-mutilation such as cutting and
burning, but little is recorded about deliberate aspiration of
objects in these patients, who clinically can be separated
into 4 groups: (1) malingering, (2) psychosis, (3) pica, and (4)
personality disorders. The immediate psychological gain for
these patients is unclear, as the act is insidious with no evi-
dence of intentional harm or immediate danger. Thus, they
are considered as being parasuicidal events designed to
diminish other psychological processes. 2 Aspirated objects
that are not immediately dislodged by coughing, chok-
ing, or gagging require surgical intervention. Most of these
patients usually come to the attention of a psychiatrist, but
such intervention does not prevent recurrences. We discuss
a schizophrenic patient who aspirated multiple coins while
under psychiatric treatment for prior episodes of aspiration
of coins, ingestion of objects, and insertion of others in his
urethra and rectum, while also reviewing some of the diag-
nostic and therapeutic challenges inherent in the manage-
ment of these patients.",,

This Study Reviewed The Management Of Patients  Presenting To A Tertiary Hospital With Foreign Body Ingestion. Patients And  Methods A Retrospective Review Of Patients Presenting With Foreign Body Ingestion  To A Tertiary Hospital In Melbourne, Victoria, Was Undertaken From January 2017  To December 2021. Data Collected Included Patient Demographics, Type Of Foreign  Body, Length Of Stay, Imaging Modalities, Management Strategies, And  Complications. High-Risk Ingestion Was Defined As Sharp Objects, Length >5 Cm,  Diameter >2.5 Cm, Button Battery And/Or Magnet Ingestion Or Esophageal As Per  International Guidelines. Results A Total Of 157 Presentations By 63 Patients  With Foreign Body Ingestion Occurred Between 2017 And 2021 (50% Male; Median Age  30 Years). Of The Patients, 56% Had Underlying Psychiatric Comorbidities. The  Majority Of Presentations Occurred In Prisoners (65%).

Methods: The Esophageal Structure And  Function Of 8 Patients Treated For Afbi Requiring Endoscopic Removal Of  Alimentary Foreign Bodies In 6 Of Them (Up To 4 Times In 1 Case) Were  Investigated By Barium Meal, Esophagoscopy-Biopsy, Ph-Metering, Pull-Through  Stationary Manometry, And 24-Hour Ambulatory Manometry. The Results Were Compared  With Those In A Group Of Age-Matched Regular Refluxers (N = 14) Without Afbi.  Results: Six Boys And 2 Girls Aged 108 +/- 59 Months Had Impaction. Six Children  Had Symptoms Of Ger Like Vomiting During Infancy, Heartburn, Or Respiratory Tract  Disease. Barium Swallow Ruled Out Stenosis In All Patients And Showed Small  Hiatal Hernias In 3. All Had Endoscopic And Histologic Esophagitis (Moderate To  Severe In 6), And One Had Schatzki Ring. All But One (Who Had 8.45 Mm Hg) Had  Normal Lower Esophageal Sphincter Pressure (16.2 +/- 4.7 Mm Hg, Mean +/- Sd), And  All Showed Normal Sphincteric Relaxation. Esophageal Body Motility Was Not  Significantly Different From That In Regular Refluxers Except In 6 Children In  Whom Energetic Distal Peristalsis After Reflux Episodes Could Be Seen  Particularly During The Night. Three Of Them Had Amazingly Powerful Distal Waves  During The Day And Even Stronger, Simultaneous, Wide And Bizarre-Shaped Waves  During Sleep. Symptoms Improved In All Cases After Antireflux Medication. Four  Patients Were Cured After Antireflux Surgery. Conclusions: Afbi Is A Dramatic But  Practically Unheard Of Symptom Of Ger In Children. It Should Be Differentiated  From Dysphagia And Reveals Motor Dysfunction, Sometimes Severe, Of The Esophageal  Body In The Absence Of Sphincteric Obstruction. Antireflux Medication Or Surgery  Were Uniformly Successful In Our Patients.",,,
