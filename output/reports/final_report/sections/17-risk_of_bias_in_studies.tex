\subsection*{Risk of Bias}
\subsubsection*{Case Reports} 
75 cases from 67 studies \cite{Akay_2015f, Al-Faham_2020k, AlShaaibi_2021b, Alao_2006i, Ali_2017, Ali_2020f, Ali_2022g, Apikotoa_2022f, Ataya_2013, Atayan_2016, Beecroft_1998, Benoist_2019e, Berry_2021e, Bhasin_2014, Bhattacharjee_2008, Bhumi_2024f, CamachoDorado_2018, Cauchi_2002, Chang_2017f, Cox_2007, Csaky_1998e, DelgadoSalazar_2020c, DivsalarP._2023a, Emamhadi_2018, Farhadi_2024h, Fry_2010, Gardner_2017h, Goldman_1998f, Guinan_2019f, Hardy_2023g, Jehangir_2019h, Jin_2023, Kar_2015, Kariholu_2008, Kerestes_2019, Kobiela_2015, Kumar_2001, Kumar_2019f, Lee_2012l, Li_2013, Liu_2005, Losanoff_1996, Losanoff_1997e, Mesfin_2022a, Misra_2013, Naji_2012f, Ohno_2005, Peixoto_2017f, Qureshi_2016, Riva_2018j, Sakellaridis_2008f, Sharma_2022e, Sobnach_2011f, Sultan_2024f, Tammana_2012j, Tanrikulu_2015e, Tay_2004, Thapa_2019f, Trgo_2012f, Tupesis_2004f, Wadhwa_2015e, Wildhaber_2005, Wnęk_2015f, Yasin_2009, Yildiz_2016e, fjbuilsRepeatedBehaviorDeliberate2024, teWildt_2010} were evaluated using the JBI Checklist for Case Reports \cite{Moola_2020}.
4 cases were excluded.
Cases were excluded at this stage as they failed to meet critical criteria in the following domains: current condition (2 cases, 50\%), post intervention condition (2 cases, 50\%), harms (2 cases, 50\%), takeaway lessons (2 cases, 50\%), history timeline (1 cases, 25\%), and intervention treatment (1 cases, 25\%). The excluded cases came from the following studies: \cite{AlShaaibi_2021b, Lee_2012l, Sharma_2022e}.
Of the remaining cases (71), 
most clearly described intervention treatment (100\%), history timeline (99\%), post intervention condition (97\%), takeaway lessons (97\%), patient demographic (96\%), and current condition (96\%). Reporting was also strong for diagnostic assessment (92\%), and harms (90\%).
\subsubsection*{Case Series}
Seperately, 3 studies \cite{Elghali_2016, Karp_1991b, Lee_2007} were evaluated using the JBI Checklist for Case Series \cite{Moola_2020}.
Reporting quality was generally high across all JBI domains. All included case series fully reported clear inclusion criteria, standard condition measurement, valid id method, complete inclusion, clear demographic reporting, clear clinical info reporting, clear outcome followup reported, and appropriate statistical analysis. However, fewer studies reported consecutive inclusion, and clear site demographic reporting.
