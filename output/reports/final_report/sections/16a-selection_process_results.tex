The study selection process is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:prisma-diagram}.

All identified articles were collated using Python (Pandas) \cite{ThePandasDevelopmentTeam_2020}. Duplicate articles were identified and removed based on non-unique combinations of author, title, and DOI.

Following duplicate removal, all remaining articles underwent title and abstract screening conducted by the first author (JGE). To ensure consistency, a randomly selected 10\% sample of these articles underwent independent screening by a second author (MS). Any discrepancies identified between these two reviewers were resolved by a third reviewer (GC).

Articles included after title and abstract screening proceeded to full-text review, which was initially performed by JGE. Again, a random 10\% sample of these full-text articles underwent independent assessment by MS. Discrepancies between JGE and MS at the full-text screening stage were similarly resolved by a third review from GC.
