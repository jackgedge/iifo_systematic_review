We present the case of a patient with an extensive history of FBIs and suicide attempts and a multitude of psychiatric diagnoses including borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder from significant abuse in foster care, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and pica. During the single hospitalization described in this report, she had multiple incidents of self-harm, aggression, and 9 FBIs. A multidisciplinary team involving psychiatry, emergency medicine, gastroenterology, surgery, internal medicine, nursing, social work, behavioral health technicians, case management, chaplain, the legal department, police officers, and hospital maintenance was necessary for care coordination. Interventions included 8 endoscopies and an abdominal surgery to retrieve swallowed foreign bodies, pain management, psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions for agitation, and environmental precautions to minimize the risk of ingestion. Ultimately, to prevent further trauma and limit additional opportunities for FBI, a collaborative decision was made with the patient to discharge her to her home with outpatient psychologist and psychiatrist support. This case describes the complexities of hospital management of a patient with intentional recurrent FBI, highlighting the importance of a critical assessment of risk versus benefit for prolonging hospitalization. Development of practical management protocols and risk assessments for continued hospitalization is necessary for patients with recurrent intentional FBIs.

This study aims to follow up patients presenting with foreign body (FB) ingestion requiring urgent endoscopic intervention under general anaesthetic in theatre, characterise each patient and establish whether admission or removal of the FB promotes further self-harm. Method: Eleven adult patients, totalling 38 presentations over a 28-month period were identified. Each was followed up from an initial presentation requiring endoscopy. Result: 9/11 (81.9%) where transferred either from prison or psychiatric care with an extensive history of multimodal and usually violent self-harm. Of these 8/9 (88.9%) had a formal psychiatric diagnosis linked to their previous self-harm. Objects retrieved included pens, razor blades, cutlery, wiring, batteries, a metal screw and a TV aerial. The median time between presentations with self-harm was 11 days. Those discharged from the emergency department re-presented after a median of 7.5 days. This was longer, at 14 days, if admitted to hospital; with those having endoscopic procedures re-presenting after a median of 11 days.

We aimed to profile the characteristics and evaluate the care of such patients in this study. Methods: Adult patients with an endoscopic record of attempted foreign body retrieval between January 2013 and September 2020 were identified at three Australian hospitals. Those with a documented mental health diagnosis were included and their standard medical records reviewed. Presentation history, demographics, comorbidities and endoscopic findings were recorded and described. Results: A total of 166 admissions were accounted for by 35 patients, 2/3 of which had borderline personality disorder (BPD). Repetitive presentations occurred in more than half of the cohort. There was an increased trend of hospital admissions throughout the years. At least half of the cohort had a documented mental health review during their admission. An average of 3.3 (2.9) foreign bodies were ingested per single episode. Endoscopic intervention was performed in 76.5% of incidents. The combined Length of stay for all patients was 680 days. Conclusion: Deliberate foreign body ingestion in mental health patients is a common, recurring and challenging problem that is increasing in frequency and requires collaborative research to further guide holistic management.

As such, the frustrations among health care providers are great, and the financial toll on health care is significant. Nevertheless, the literature on DFBI is sparse, and suggestions for treatment planning and management are limited. The authors sought to investigate and uncover efficacious treatments and strategies for preventing reoccurrence in DFBI. We build on earlier work by offering both broad and diagnosis-specific management strategies. Method: A literature review was performed addressing the presentation, management and prevention of reoccurrences of DFBI. Four cases of DFBI are presented illustrating those psychiatric diagnoses (psychosis, malingering, obsessive–compulsive disorder and borderline personality disorder) most frequently encountered in hospital practice. Both broad and specific treatment approaches are presented. Results: Patients engaging in DFBI are best managed through a multidisciplinary approach, following acute medical management. Successful strategies for the prevention of reoccurrences of DFBI are inconclusive. Conclusion: Understanding the function of this behavior is critical in developing treatment for patients who engage in these dangerous, potentially life-threatening, self-injurious behaviors. An amalgam of medical, pharmacological and cognitive–behavioral interventions is recommended, as is additional research.

This case presentation focuses on self-harm involving the deliberate ingestion of foreign bodies. This behavior remains poorly understood, and the relevant literature focuses almost entirely on gastroenterological and surgical management, with little or no discussion of underlying psychological mechanisms, psychopathology, or psychotherapeutic intervention. The goal of this article is to begin to fill that gap by presenting the case of a young woman who was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and followed for 20 years, who repeatedly swallowed objects as a form of self-harming behavior. The nosological status and possible functions of this behavior are discussed, as are the difficulties of caring for patients with such long-standing, repeated self-injury. This case illustrates how the boundaries between different self-injurious behaviors are blurred and also how different self-injurious behaviors are likely to share common patterns, functional integrity, and meanings. It should also serve to remind us how far we have to go in terms of understanding, classifying, and successfully treating certain patients who present with long-term and bizarre self-injurious behavior.

This study aimed to analyse the circumstances of self-harm and suicide attempts in a Japanese psychiatric hospital so as to improve management and care. Methods: Incident reports of self-harm and suicide attempts during a 12.4-year period from November 2000 to March 2013 were reviewed. A descriptive analysis was conducted in terms of age, sex, and diagnosis of patients, as well as level, ward, situations, and causes of incidents. Results: During the study period, 90 cases of self-harm and attempted suicide involving 58 patients were reported. The rate of self-harm and suicide attempts was 0.05 per 1000 patient-days. The types of self-harm and suicide attempts included hanging (n = 25), wrist cutting (n = 19), ingestion of foreign objects (n = 17), and others (n = 29). The single case of completed suicide involved hanging, in a patient with schizophrenia. Among 55 patients with relevant data, the most common clinical diagnosis was mood disorder (41.8%), followed by schizophrenia (36.4%). Mood disorder was 3.5 times as prevalent in females as in males (14 vs. 4). Fourteen patients with mood disorder (n = 8) or schizophrenia (n = 6) were repeatedly involved in 46 of 89 cases of self-harm or attempted suicide; 11 were female. One woman with mood disorder attempted suicide 9 times within the same year. The top 3 management and care factors related to self-harm and suicide attempts were failure to adhere to preventive procedures (28%), insufficient therapeutic communication (28%), and difficulty in predicting suicide (20%). Conclusion: Self-harm and suicide attempts at this psychiatric hospital occurred at a rate of 0.05 per 1000 patient-days between late 2000 and early 2013. Efforts are needed to increase compliance with suicide prevention procedures and therapeutic communication, so as to improve management and care of psychiatric in-patients and prevent them from committing suicide.

Barent W. Walsh provides current, evidence-based knowledge about this increasingly prevalent problem and how to treat it effectively. Fully revised to incorporate the latest research and clinical strategies, the second edition uses a stepped-care framework to match interventions to client needs. It features new chapters on the relationship between suicide and self-injury; formal assessment; family therapy; residential treatment for adolescents; and severe types of self-injury. Walsh is joined by several colleagues who have contributed chapters in their respective areas of expertise. Part I offers a practical introduction to self-injury: what specific behaviors clinicians are likely to encounter, which populations are most at risk and why, and connections to suicidality. Part II, the core of the volume, addresses assessment and treatment. Chapters on a wide range of cognitive-behavioral interventions include vivid case examples that illuminate the thoughts and feelings of self-injurers and show what the therapeutic strategies look like in action. Clinicians get essential guidance for tailoring interventions for clients with different symptom presentations, levels of impairment, and co-occurring problems. Part III covers special topics, including managing self-injury in school settings and correctional facilities. Chapters also present vital information on dangerous behaviors such as the 'choking game,' foreign body ingestion, and major self-injury. Rounding out the volume, the appendices contain helpful resources, including assessment instruments and a manual for teaching breathing techniques to manage distress. These and other reproducible materials in the book can be downloaded and printed in a convenient 8 1/2' x 11' size (www.guilford.com/p/walsh5). From a highly regarded leader in the field, this invaluable guide belongs on the desks of clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, and clinical social workers treating adolescents and adults, as well as graduate students and trainees across the mental health disciplines.

Results show that self-mutilation behaviors in the studied prison population appeared to be infrequent, and self-mutilation related to psychopathological factors (attempted hanging, suicide) showed no apparent increase. The observed upwards trend mainly concerned types of self-mutilation described as linked to socio-environmental factors. Suicide appeared relatively rare.

It has attracted great interest among mental health professionals over the last decades. However, this issue is rarely reported in the literature. A deep exploration of its clinical and specific psychopathological aspects remains limited. Case report: We report the case of a 32-year-old female patient, who was sentenced to 20years in prison for homicide against her cousin, the daughter of an uncle who had raped her when she was 14. This affair was hushed by the patient's family and the patient was submitted to several acts of abuse by her family. Following her incarceration, she repeatedly ingested metallic objects requiring repeated admissions in a department of surgery for endoscopic extractions or surgical interventions. She impulsively ingested more than 30 times various metallic objects such as wire, razor blades, spoons, etc., under the pressure of impulsiveness and massive anxiety. Voluntary metal ingestions, associated with iterative self-mutilation behaviors, took place within the framework of a borderline personality disorder, the incarceration and the conditions of imprisonment playing a role in initiating and retaining the behavior. Conclusion: Through this case report, we examine the specific psychiatric aspects of intentional ingestion of metallic objects in order to better understand this behavior.

Prevention is especially important in a psychiatric setting. This study aimed to analyze the incidence of inedible substance ingestion in a Japanese psychiatric hospital. Methods: Inedible substance ingestion incidents were extracted from an incident report database spanning 2000–2012 at a 400‐bed psychiatric hospital in Japan. We tabulated the frequencies of incidents in accordance with major diagnosis, ingested materials, incident levels, and time of occurrence. Results: The incidence rate was 0.09/1000 patient days, and 149 cases in 105 patients were classified as having experienced inedible substance ingestion. The most common diagnosis was dementia (n = 58), followed by schizophrenia (n = 22). Materials ingested by dementia patients were nappies or gauze attached to the patient's body after medical procedures. Materials ingested by schizophrenic patients were liquid soap, detergent or shampoo, and cigarettes. Inedible substance ingestion among dementia patients occurred mostly before or during meals. Among schizophrenic patients, the peak period of incidents was in the evening. Conclusions: Dementia patients were overrepresented in the inedible substance ingestion incidents. Items they wore or applied to their bodies were often subject to ingestion, and such behaviours mostly occurred around meal time. Therefore, the nursing staff were able to discover them quickly and treat most of the cases free of serious consequences. In contrast, schizophrenic patients were underrepresented in the incidents, and most cases involved ingestion of detergent powder or cigarettes, resulting in more serious consequences and requiring treatment.

Available literature on this topic tends to focus on the small child or adult, leaving the clinician caring for adolescents to extrapolate this information to guide decision making for individual patients. This article reviews foreign body ingestion literature with important implications to the adolescent patient and raises awareness of some highly dangerous objects such as large button batteries, high-powered magnets, long sharps, narcotic packages, and super absorbent objects. An additional focus includes the management of esophageal food impaction. We highlight the unique aspects to the care of the adolescent with intentional ingestion and co-morbid psychiatric illness. The article concludes by discussing the challenges to prevention of ingestion in the at-risk patient.

A subset of this topic, the intentional ingestion of foreign bodies, however, is much less common, and requires special evaluation and management. Here, we report a case of ingestion of a rolled, metal tuna can lid in a male prison inmate previously diagnosed with depression and paranoid schizophrenia. Following evaluation by the surgical team, the foreign body was removed by laparotomy and the patient was discharged back to the prison without complication. In many cases, ingestions of this type involve a command hallucination ordering the patient to swallow the foreign body. Interestingly, the patient in the present case reported auditory hallucinations commanding him not to swallow the can lid. On further investigation, we found that patient had a proclivity toward this swallowing behavior even prior to his incarceration. Early identification of inmates with this proclivity has important implications for treatment and prevention.

Much has been written about psychiatric patients engaging in self-mutilation such as cutting and burning, but little is recorded about deliberate aspiration of objects in these patients, who clinically can be separated into 4 groups: (1) malingering, (2) psychosis, (3) pica, and (4) personality disorders. The immediate psychological gain for these patients is unclear, as the act is insidious with no evidence of intentional harm or immediate danger. Thus, they are considered as being parasuicidal events designed to diminish other psychological processes. Aspirated objects that are not immediately dislodged by coughing, choking, or gagging require surgical intervention. Most of these patients usually come to the attention of a psychiatrist, but such intervention does not prevent recurrences. We discuss a schizophrenic patient who aspirated multiple coins while under psychiatric treatment for prior episodes of aspiration of coins, ingestion of objects, and insertion of others in his urethra and rectum, while also reviewing some of the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges inherent in the management of these patients.

A high mortality rate has been reported among psychotic patients due to the number and bizarreness of the objects and the difficulty of making a firm diagnosis of such patients. The nonpsychotic patient who has swallowed a foreign body as a manipulative gesture is a type seen among prison populations. Diagnosis is facilitated by the intention of obtaining secondary gain. There is a marked tendency to repeat the action. Prison population manipulative swallowers are often uncooperative, demanding or refusing surgery at times. Their behavior makes patient management deviate from the ideal of expectant treatment.
