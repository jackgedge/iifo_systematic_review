Pulmonary aspiration continues to be an ever-threatening clinical problem even though knowledge of lung defense mechanisms and predisposing factors of aspiration has been advanced to a point which allows identification of patients at risk of suffering pulmonary aspiration. The identification of patients at risk however has not permitted adequate preventive measures from being exercised. This problem persists in part because few of the predisposing factors are reversible or controllable to a degree which would preclude pulmonary aspiration. In addition, the clinical diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration is more often tentative than absolute and based on the clinical setting and changes demonstrated on serial chest radiographs. This situation emphasizes the role of the radiologist and his knowledge of radiographic findings in pulmonary aspiration in suggesting the diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration. The diagnosis may then be confirmed by additional chest radiographs or by bronchoscopy and the retrieval of the aspirated material.
An understanding of the pathophysiology of the types of pulmonary aspiration serves to increase the awareness of certain pulmonary complications from aspiration, to select appropriate diagnostic studies, and to institute specific therapy. However, the nature of the material aspirated by a patient may not be obvious initially unless the episode is witnessed and may only be determined in retrospect in some cases. Thus, radiologists play a primary role in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration. Frequently, radiologists must integrate the chest radiographic findings of pulmonary aspirationthe distribution, types of parenchymal opacities, and the expected temporal changes in these opacities, with the patient's clinical situation to establish a diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration (Tables 5, 6).
Until recently, therapy of pulmonary aspiration was standardized, pragmatic, and frequently lacked an understanding of the distinct types of pulmonary aspiration. Controversy still surrounds some aspects of therapy. Perhaps, with additional efforts."

cheobronchial foreign body were reviewed. The duration of residence of the for-
eign body was 1 week or less in nine (""acute group""); 1 month or more in 29
(""chronic group""), uncertain in four (""uncertain group""); and the foreign body was
a broncholith in five patients (""broncholith group""). In the chronic and uncertain
groups, no precipitating factor was found and bone was the most common foreign
body. In the chronic group, a choking history was obtained before bronchoscopy
in only 15 patient.
Clinical manifestations and roentgenograms were nonspecific in most cases, except
in the acute group. In the chronic group, the mean duration of residence of the
foreign body was 25.8 months. The diagnosis was delayed due to absence of a
choking history and invisibility of the foreign body on chest films in 12, due to
patient's ignorance in 14, due to physician's ignorance in 1, and due to previous
unsuccessful retrieval attempts in 2 patients.
The main indication for bronchoscopy in the acute group was a choking history
or a visible foreign body on the chest film. In the chronic group, a choking histo-
ry or conditions leading to ""suspicion of an endobronchial lesion"" were the main
indications. The foreign body was removed with a fibreoptic bronchoscope in over
90% of patients. It is concluded that the most important diagnostic factor is a high
clinical index of suspicion and that flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy provides a valu-
able therapeutic option in selected conditions."

METHODS: For children under 15 years, all Victorian public hospital admissions, July 1987 to June 1995, due to asphyxiation or 'foreign body entering through other orifice' (which includes ingestions), were reviewed. Emergency department presentations due to asphyxiation and foreign body ingestion provided information on circumstances of, and the type of foreign bodies involved in the injuries. RESULTS: The childhood average annual admission rate for asphyxiation was 15.1 per 100,000. Food related asphyxiation peaked in infants under 1 year, and declined to low levels by 3 years. The main foods involved were nuts, carrot, apple, and candy. The rate of non-food related asphyxiation was relatively constant to 3 years of age and then declined by 6 years. Mechanical suffocation was less common. The annual admission rate for 'foreign body entering through other orifice' was 31.7 per 100,000. These injuries peaked in 2-3 year olds then gradually declined. About 80% of these foreign body admissions were ingestions, with coins being the major object ingested. Admission rates for these causes remained constant over the eight years. Asphyxiation resulted in a higher proportion admitted and longer hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of suffocation and strangulation needs to focus on a safe sleeping environment and avoidance of ropes and cords, while foreign body asphyxiation and ingestion needs a focus on education of parents and child carers regarding age, appropriate food, risk of play with coins, and other small items. Legislation for toy small parts could be extended to those used by children up to the age of 5 years, and to other products marketed for children. Design changes and warning labels also have a place in prevention."

Results: The average age of the five children identified in this study was 3 years. The items ingested included coins, a heart pendant, a clothespin spring, and a toy soldier. Complications from chronically retained foreign bodies were bronchoesophageal fistula, mediastinitis, esophageal diverticulum, and lobar atelectasis. One patient died from an aortoesophageal fistula. In all children, endoscopic removal was attempted. Barium esophagram was then performed, and foreign bodies were eventually removed via right thoracotomy.
Conclusions: Long-retained esophageal FBs are extremely morbid and life threatening. History most often identifies excess salivation, new onset asthma, and/or recurrent upper respiratory infections. Three diagnostic adjuncts are helpful in identifying the presence of a long retained FB: (1) Chest x-ray (PA and lateral), (2) barium swallow, and (3) esophagoscopy. Indications for thoracotomy for removal of foreign body include (1) Poor endoscopic visualization of FB because of inflammatory tissue and (2) Herald bleeding during endoscopy."

In dealing with young children it is important to maintain a high clinical suspicion of a foreign body and to perform a detailed history and physical examination. Options in radiographic analysis of the patient with a suspected foreign body, probable locations of the foreign body, and the likelihood of definitive radiographic findings are discussed. Importantly, a negative radiographic analysis does not rule out the presence of an aerodigestive tract foreign body. Two flow charts for the evaluation of patients who have possibly ingested or inhaled a foreign body are presented to aid the primary care physician in diagnosis."

The authors prefer to initially attempt removal of smooth, radiopaque esophageal foreign bodies using the balloon technique and then proceed to rigid esophagoscopy if unsuccessful.
Methods: The authors reviewed their 7-year experience with this approach in 276 children with esophageal foreign bodies.
Results: One hundred seventy-three children underwent attempted balloon extraction, and 146 of these underwent successful removal with this method. Fifteen remained lodged in the esophagus and were subsequently removed by esophagoscopy, and 12 passed into the stomach and were observed. The only complication was one episode of epistaxis that resolved. Success of the balloon method was not related to patient age, foreign body duration, location, or presenting symptoms. The use of more than 5 minutes of fluoroscopy time was associated with a low likelihood of successful extraction.
Conclusion: The balloon extraction technique is a safe and effective alternative to rigid esophagoscopy for the removal of slected esophageal foreign bodies in children."

On one hand, the work in this field has been justly influential. It brings sophisticated psychoanalytic concepts to bear on collective processes, developing accounts of historical violence that are both socially specific and psychologically astute. These accounts are especially compelling when focused on what I call ""punctual"" traumas: historical events of such singularity, magnitude, and horror that they can be read as shocks that disable the psychic system. Thus, for example, in their readings of the Holocaust-the paradigmatic example for critics concerned with this kind of trauma-Caruth and others have helped us see how a historical moment might be experienced less as an ongoing set of processes that shape and are shaped by those living through them than as a punctual blow to the psyche that overwhelms its functioning, disables its defenses, and absents it from direct contact with the brutalizing event itself. Precisely because the violence suffered by Holocaust victims was so extreme, on this view, it affected those victims as a psychic concussion that short-circuited their capacity to ""process"" the traumatizing event as it took place. Traumas of this kind thus become accessible only in the mind's recursive attempts to master what it has in some sense failed to experience in the first instance. A punctual incursion on the mind, having ""dissociated"" consciousness from itself, installs an unprocessed memory-trace that returns unbidden, as delayed effect, in an effort to force the mind to digest this previously unclaimed kernel of experience."

They were divided randomly and equally into three groups (2 treatment groups and one control group). Patients in group (1) (HBOT group) received two 90 minutes treatments daily with 2 to3 L of humidified oxygen / minute at 22 mmHg. On the other hand, patients in group (2) (laser therapy group) received 1 J/cm2 infrared laser (Ga As), three times weekly. Patients in group (3) (control group) received standard wound care only. Wound surface area (WSA) and wound volume (WV) were used to measure the outcomes before starting the study and after the 3rd and 5th weeks posttreatment. It was found that, at the 5th week post-treatment there was a significant reduction in both WSA and WV in both the HBOT group and the laser therapy group when compared to the control group (P<0.0001), also there was a significant reduction in WSA and WV in the laser therapy group at the 5th week post-treatment when compared to the HBOT group (P<0.001). The findings strongly suggest that the application of infrared laser therapy at a dose of 1J/cm2, three times/week is more effective than the application of HBOT daily in the management of chronic venous ulcers.

Thought it is a rare form of skin cancer there are about 160,000 new cases of melanoma yearly worldwide. More than 53,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with melanoma every year. It is currently the fastest growing cancer, both in the U.S. and worldwide. We present a case of a patient with metastatic malignant melanoma presenting as an infiltrating mass into the duodenum from the retroperitoneal space. A 77 year old male presented with fatigue and weight loss over the course of the preceding several months. The patient's past medical history was only significant for hyperlipidemia and BPH. The patient states that he has lost 40 lbs over the previous 1-2 months prior to admission. Physical exam was benign except for a palpable mass and guaiac testing was positive. The patient had a CT scan which demonstrated large complex lobulated mass in the sub-hepatic space measuring approximately 14.7 _ 14.1 _ 10.8 cm. The patient's labs demonstrated hemoglobin of 7.9, and the patient was transfused and taken for upper endoscopy. On esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) neoplastic lesions were noted to infiltrate the dudodenal bulb. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration demonstrated a hetergoenous mass with both hypo/hyperechoic features. The biopsy showed malignant cells most in architecture to melanoma. Immuno-histochemical studies performed on the cell block demonstrated positive staining of the tumor cells for vimentin, HMB45, melan-A, and focally for S100. Stains for mixed cytokeratins, smooth muscle actin, and CD34 are negative in the tumor cells. The final diagnosis of malignant melanoma was subsequently made. The patient was referred for surgical evaluation. Metastatic retroperitoneal lesions resulting from melanoma is an extremely rare finding and EUS-FNA is a novel method for diagnosing metastatic lesions. EUS-FNA has been shown to be a safe and reliable modality for obtaining definitive histological diagnosis. When it is compared with the traditional diagnostic modalities, it is not only more accurate than imaging studies such as computerized tomography, positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, but it is also a very safe procedure with fewer complications than transcutaneous biopsies. Clinicians should be aware of this imaging modality and consider its employment when applicable."

Common malignancies in renal transplant recipients are non melanoma skin cancer, Kaposi sarcoma and non-hodgkin lymphoma with a 20 fold increase in their risk. Renal cell carcinoma in native kidneys after renal transplant is quite infrequent (0.3-4.8%). Here we report first case of renal cell carcinoma originating in native kidney, diagnosed by EUS guided FNA. Case Description: A 54-year-old gentleman status post renal transplant secondary to Goodpastures syndrome presented with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. His past medical history include hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. Early investigations included a liver battery, amylase, lipase; CBC and a basic metabolic panel were found negative. A right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed normal liver and gallbladder, however, cyst was found in an enlarged right native kidney. MRI of the abdomen showed retroperitoneal lymph nodes concerning for lymphoma along with enlargement of the right native kidney with irregular borders concerning for neoplasm. He then underwent endoscopic ultrasound to evaluate the perigastric/peripancreatic area for possible fine-needle aspiration of lymph nodes. The endosonographic examination revealed multiple lymph nodes at sub-carinal, paraesophageal, celiac axis, peripancreatic and periduodenal areas. Small-to-moderate amount of ascites was identified. Using a 25-gauge needle, fine-needle aspiration was performed from mediatsinal lymph nodes, celiac lymph nodes and peripancreatic lymph nodes. Ascetic fluid was then aspirated using a 19-gauge needle under endosonographic guidance. Cytopathology of the lymph node and ascetic fluid samples revealed metastatic renal cell carcinoma. PET scan confirmed it by lighting up in right kidney and other areas of metastatic lymphadenopathy. Conclusion: In conclusion, EUS guided FNA could have an important role in identifying the primary source of metastatic lymphadenopathy in renal transplant patients. It is safe, minimally invasive, feasible and highly accurate in making such diagnosis and assisting further management."

Fish bone (FB) is one of the common causes of foreign body impaction in the pharynx and esophagus.
Purpose
To investigate the efficacy of 64-slice multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) for the evaluation of pharynx and upper esophageal FB foreign bodies.
Material and Methods
Sixty-six patients with suspected FB foreign body ingestion were examined by plain radiography (n_=_40) and unenhanced MDCT (n_=_66). We analyzed the presence, location, size, shape, and lying position of the foreign bodies.
Results
On MDCT, 46 foreign bodies were detected. Among them, 45 were confirmed by endoscopy. The sensitivity of MDCT for the detection of foreign bodies was 100%, which was superior to that of the plain radiography (51.7%). The location of the foreign bodies was most common in the upper esophagus (n_=_22, 47.8%), followed by pharyngoesophageal junction (n_=_10, 21.7%), transjunctional (n_=_7, 15.2%), hypopharynx (n_=_5, 10.9%), and oropharynx (n_=_2, 4.3%). Their longest length was 5.340.1_mm (mean, 21.3_mm). Thirty-three FBs (71.7%) were linear and 13 (28.3%) were flat in shape. They showed transverse (n_=_23, 50.0%), parallel (n_=_13, 28.3%), and oblique positions (n_=_10, 21.7%) to the long axis of the pharynx and esophagus, respectively.
Conclusion
MDCT is useful for the evaluation of the pharynx and upper esophageal FB foreign bodies."

He was a true inventor, creating many surgical instruments that were not known in the Greco-Roman era. Quite early, he produced contributions influencing surgical procedures in Europe from the 14th to the 18th centuries. As a problem solver, he was aware of anatomical and physiological problems, and he moved through design, methods of manufacturing, and practical applications.

The management and clinical course in pediatric patients who had ingested foreign body were investigated retrospectively to evaluate the frequency and factor associated with successful removal of fishbone foreign body.
Methods
Based on the medical records of patients younger than 15 years old who visited emergency room because of foreign body ingestion from January 1999 to December 2012, the authors reviewed clinical characteristics including type of ingested foreign bodies, time to visits, managements and complications.
Results
Fishbone (50.1%) was the most common ingested foreign body in children. Among 416 patients with ingested fishbone, 245 (58.9%) were identified and removed using laryngoscope, rigid or flexible endoscope from pharynx or upper esophagus by otolaryngologists and pediatric gastroenterologists. The kind of ingested fish bone in children was diverse. The mean age of identified and removed fishbone group was 7.39 years old, and higher than that of unidentified fishbone group (5.81 years old, p<0.001). Identified and removed fishbone group had shorter time until hospital visit than the unidentified fishbone group (2.03 vs. 6.47 hours, p<0.001). No complication due to ingested fishbone or procedure occurred.
Conclusion
Older age and shorter time from accident to hospital visit were the different factors between success and failure on removal of ingested fish bone in children."

Their diminished faith in the surety of sanitary surveillance was linked directly to the widespread perception that Eastern European, primarily Jewish, immigrants and transmigrant (en route to America), were the prime conduits of the disease. Temporary measures were aimed directly at the migrants and appeared to contradict the long-standing assertions of antiquarantinists. The chapter explores whether the migrants came to represent a different subset within the categorisation of port diseases, and how they came to represent another notion of space or locality within the sanitary zone."

The esophagus is a muscular tubular organ responsible for the transport of food from the mouth to the stomach. The esophagus has a parasympathetic innervation through the vagus nerve, which runs along the esophagus. Sympathetic innervation arises from postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic chain. Once food enters the esophagus, it is transported by a propulsive peristaltic wave into the stomach. Pathological reflux in this age group may be characterized by different symptoms. The most typical reported signs are regurgitation and effortless leak-out of milk or food after meals, between meals, and when asleep."

Diagnosis and treatment options for EP are limited due to its lower incidence. There are scoring systems proposed for this purpose;
however, they cannot be applied to every patient. The recent trend in the treatment of EP is toward the non-operative approach over the
surgical treatment methods. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate our treatment methods and outcomes in patients with EP.
METHODS: Thirteen patients with EP treated in our clinic between 2013 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. The Pittsburgh
Perforation Severity Score (PSS), systemic condition status, and ClavienDindo Classification (CDC) score were assessed, and treatment
methods were reviewed. Their effects on morbidity and mortality were examined using Fishers exact test and biserial correlation test.
RESULTS: A total of 13 patients (six males and seven females; median age 64 years) were included in the study. Ten patients were
managed non-operative, and three were treated surgically. Of the 10 patients, two had additional surgery after non-operative manage-
ment. The PSS, systemic condition status, CDC score, duration of stay in the hospital, time to diagnosis, presence of hypotension, and
being in shock were strongly correlated with mortality (p<0.05). The PSS, CDC score, and stay in the intensive care unit were strongly
correlated with morbidity (p<0.05). The comparison between the non-operative and operative groups did not yield a statistically
significant difference in mortality and morbidity.
CONCLUSION: Even if the scoring systems help to understand the severity of the condition, they are inadequate to determine the
treatment option. Early diagnosis and treatment are the most important steps in management. Operative and non-operative treatment
options are not superior to each other, but their complementary use will be more beneficial for the patients.

We retrospectively analysed necropsies performed between 2012 and 2019 on 88 cetaceans stranded along the coast of Catalonia, Spain, and evaluated the association of abnormal ingested materials with 2 risk factors, namely disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and maternal separation. Abnormal materials were found in the digestive tract in 19 of 88 (21.6%) cetaceans; of these, 13 (60%) had lesions in the CNS, such as morbilliviral encephalitis, neurobrucellosis or encephalomalacia, and 3 were diagnosed as having experienced maternal separation. In a logistic regression model, CNS lesions and maternal separation were identified as risk factors for ingestion of foreign material, but with wide confidence intervals, probably due to the small sample size. In contrast, abnormal ingestion was not identified in any of the 25 (28%) cetaceans whose cause of death was attributed to interaction with humans. Abnormal ingestion should be interpreted with caution, and efforts should be made at necropsy to exclude CNS diseases through pathologic and microbiologic investigations. If disease of the CNS is a significant risk factor for ingestion of marine debris by small odontocetes, results of monitoring programmes may be biased by the prevalence of CNS disease in a specific area or population.

Patients having trouble with secretions due to foreign body ingestion should have an endoscopy within 24 hours. Button batteries constitute a special type of foreign bodies because they cause damage by three combined mechanisms. Due to their shape, these devices can lodge in the esophagus. Electrical current generated in the negative pole of the battery produces hydroxide, and the acid contents of the stomach can cause the battery to leak its contents, which are mainly alkaline electrolytes. The combination of those factors causes liquefaction necrosis, which in turn can lead to perforation and future scarring. Magnets are another type of foreign body that deserves special attention."

Esophageal impaction of a foreign body  whether it is blunt or sharp  requires more urgent intervention compared to more distally located foreign bodies. Food bolus impaction in children may indicate underlying esophageal pathology, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, peptic or other strictures, achalasia, and other motility disorders. Optimal endoscopic management of foreign bodies depends on their location and type."

Background: Foreign body (FB) in the aerodigestive tract presents more commonly in children and remains a surgical emergency with potential for fatal complications.

Objectives: To describe management and outcomes of aerodigestive FB managed at University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH) and proffer preventive measures.

Methods: A 9-year retrospective review of all patients with foreign body in the aerodigestive tract managed between March 2011 and July 2020.

Results: Sixty-six patients were studied. Median age was 9years with M:F ratio =1.6:1. FB was ingested in 38(57.6%) patients, aspiration occurred in 28(42.4%). Denture was most common FB 20(30.3%); plastic whistle/valve placed in dolls or football accounted for 4(6.1%). When ingested, FB was impacted in cervical 17(44.7%), upper thoracic 10(26.3%) and middle thoracic 2(5.3%) oesophagus. Oesophagoscopy was used in 30(8.9%) for retrieval. When aspirated, FB was located in the right bronchus 10(35.7%), left bronchus 7(25.0%), hypopharynx and trachea 2(7.1%) each, and cricopharynx 1(3.5%); no FB was found in 3(10.7%) patients. Direct Laryngoscopy was the method of retrieval in 3(10.1%) patients while others had rigid bronchoscopy. Mortality rate was 1.5%.

Conclusion: Children are most vulnerable group. Preventive effort should include public health education and close monitoring of children by parents and care givers during play."

pecially; if the victim is a child. Infants and children are the most commonly seen victims, ingestion is often intentional, unlike
adults, who constitute a small proportion of victims and ingestion is often accidental. The number of foreign bodies found at
the emergency units of many hospitals is quite large. These include coins, safety pins, sewing needles, button batteries and nuts.
However, many of the foreign bodies are excreted safely without any untoward events, except for foreign bodies with sharp
ends, containing toxic chemicals and where there is a pre-existing anatomical abnormality in the gastro-Intestinal Tract (GIT).
Foreign bodies, especially those with sharp ends are prone to getting arrested, inflicting mucosal erosion or even perforating any
part of the GIT, particularly at the site of physiologic or anatomic constrictions. These areas are the three Oesophageal anatomic
narrowing, the pylorus, Ileo-Caecal valve and the recto-sigmoid junction. Most foreign bodies can be seen on plain radiograph,
removal, where indicated, can be done endoscopically or through an open surgery. But, majority can be managed expectantly,
aided by patience, careful serial radiographic monitoring and perhaps use of lubricating solutions like liquid paraffin.
Report of a transluminal migration is rare. We therefore report an unusual case of a trans-vesical migration of a swallowed
sewing needle with intra-urethral impaction in a 12-year-old boy. The impacted needle was removed via an open Urethrotomy."

The ingestion of foreign body is a common problem in children, some of which may cause damage or may be associated with toxicity.
Objective
To evaluate and analyze the pattern of foreign bodies in children in the esophagus, ears and nose with review of the techniques for removal in the emergency department.
Methods
From Sept 1, 2008 to May 30, 2010, a review of all children with foreign bodies in the esophagus, ears and in the nose was done to assess the patterns and treatment outcomes. The source and the study group were (N-72). Data concerning socio- demographics, characterization, presenting symptoms and signs, techniques of retrieval and outcomes were extracted and filled in a previously prepared protocol sheet. Descriptive analysis was done using SPSS- computer statistical software.
Results
During the study period, 72 children, victims of foreign bodies in the esophagus, ears and in the nose were included in the study. Of these 44 (61.1%), 28 (38.9%) were male and female children, respectively. The age ranged from 11 months to 14 years with (mean = 4 years). The most affected age group was between 0-5 years accounting for 46 (63.9%) followed by the age group between 6-10 years accounting for 20 (27.8%) of all cases. Males 44 (61.1%) were predominantly most affected than females 28 (38.8%). The location of foreign bodies in this study were in the ears 45 (62.5%), esophagus 17 (23.6%) and in the nose 10 (13.9%) in order of their frequency. Swallowed foreign bodies were successfully removed by Magill forceps. Foreign bodies in the ears and in the nose were removed by careful but different techniques depending on the type and the clinical condition of the patient at time of intervention.
Conclusion
Our study revealed a higher number of patients with foreign bodies in the ears and in the esophagus. Only a small number ofpatients presented with FBS in the nose. Food items in the ears, in the nose and coins in the esophagus were items frequently observed. Early suspicion, early diagnosis and prompt intervention have attributed to reduce morbidities of major events."
