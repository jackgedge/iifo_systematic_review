\subsection*{Eligibility Criteria}

This review included studies involving human participants of any age who had non-accidental ingestion of a true foreign body (non-nutritive items). Studies were only included if they reported on all of the following data: motivations for ingestion (such as protest, suicidal intent, self-harm, or psychiatric conditions); management strategies (including whether conservative, endoscopic, or surgical treatment was used); and object characteristics such as type (e.g., blunt, sharp, long, short, multiple objects). All settings were eligible, and a wide range of study designs were accepted, including observational studies (cohort, case-control, cross-sectional), case series, clinical trials, and case reports. 

A full list of eligibility criteria is availabe in Appendix~\ref{tab:inclusion-criteria} and a full list of exclusion criteria is available in Appendix~\ref{tab:exclusion-criteria}.
