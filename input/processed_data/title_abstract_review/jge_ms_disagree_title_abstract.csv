METHODS: For children under 15 years, all Victorian public hospital admissions, July 1987 to June 1995, due to asphyxiation or 'foreign body entering through other orifice' (which includes ingestions), were reviewed. Emergency department presentations due to asphyxiation and foreign body ingestion provided information on circumstances of, and the type of foreign bodies involved in the injuries. RESULTS: The childhood average annual admission rate for asphyxiation was 15.1 per 100,000. Food related asphyxiation peaked in infants under 1 year, and declined to low levels by 3 years. The main foods involved were nuts, carrot, apple, and candy. The rate of non-food related asphyxiation was relatively constant to 3 years of age and then declined by 6 years. Mechanical suffocation was less common. The annual admission rate for 'foreign body entering through other orifice' was 31.7 per 100,000. These injuries peaked in 2-3 year olds then gradually declined. About 80% of these foreign body admissions were ingestions, with coins being the major object ingested. Admission rates for these causes remained constant over the eight years. Asphyxiation resulted in a higher proportion admitted and longer hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of suffocation and strangulation needs to focus on a safe sleeping environment and avoidance of ropes and cords, while foreign body asphyxiation and ingestion needs a focus on education of parents and child carers regarding age, appropriate food, risk of play with coins, and other small items. Legislation for toy small parts could be extended to those used by children up to the age of 5 years, and to other products marketed for children. Design changes and warning labels also have a place in prevention.",False,,True,3.0

public awareness campaigns its incidence is increasing with the passage of time. The purpose of this study is to highlight the severe
complications associated with it and to sensitize the community to participate in its prevention to avoid catastrophic outcomes.
Patients and Methods: This study included 47 patients. Protocol includes patient`s age, time of presentation, signs and symptoms
and relevant radiographic investigations. Button batteries were urgently removed under general anesthesia.
Results: The average follow up period is 3 months. Total 47 patients are included in this study. Three patients has BB in stomach and
below, twenty six had BB in cricopharynx and eighteen in hypopharynx. Two patients developed esophageal perforation. One patient
developed aortoesophageal fistula and died.

ported clinical problem. There are no data to
evaluate the prevalence of this phenomenon
in Poland. In the United States the annual
death rate due to foreign body ingestion is
estimated at up to 1500-2700 (1). In 80% of
cases foreign body ingestion is unintentional
and reported in children (2). Among adults
unintentional foreign body ingestion is re-
ported most commonly in the elderly and al-
cohol-dependent patients (3). Some literature
indicates that intentional foreign body inges-
tion among adults accounts for only 10% of all
cases (4), there are however studies suggesting
that intentional foreign body ingestion ac-
counts for up to 92% of all cases of foreign body
ingestion (5). Multiple retrospective studies
confirm consistently that intentional foreign
body ingestions are most commonly reported
in patients with psychiatric disorders, mental
impairment and in prison inmates (4-7).
Considering all cases together, the major-
ity of foreign bodies pass spontaneously,
10-20% require endoscopic intervention and
only 1% are removed surgically (3). Inten-
tional foreign body ingestion is associated
with much more severe consequences, which
require emergency medical intervention in up
to 76% of patients and surgery in 28% of pa-
tients (8).
Foreign body ingestion management de-
pends on the characteristics of the ingested
foreign body, such as: size, shape, presence of
sharp edges, its location, time from ingestion,
severity of clinical symptoms and development
of potential complications (5). on the other
hand the material the foreign body is made of
determines the usefulness of diagnostic tech-
niques (9, 10).

Endoscopic methods [endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)] are useful tools to diagnose and manage
chronic pancreatitis. Pediatric knowledge and use of these modalities is
limited and warrants dissemination.
Methods: Literature review of publications relating to use of ERCP and EUS
for diagnosis and/or management of chronic pancreatitis with special attention
to studies involving 018 years old subjects was conducted with summaries
generated. Recommendations were developed and voted upon by authors.
Results: Both EUS and ERCP can be used even in small children to assist in
diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in cases where cross-sectional imaging is
not sufficient to diagnose or characterize the disease. Children under 15 kg
for EUS and 10 kg for ERCP can be technically challenging. These
procedures should be done optimally by appropriately trained endoscopists
and adult gastroenterology providers with appropriate experience treating
children. EUS and ERCP-related risks both include perforation, bleeding and
pancreatitis. EUS is the preferred diagnostic modality over ERCP because of
lower complication rates overall. Both modalities can be used for management
of chronic pancreatitis -related fluid collections. ERCP has successfully been
used to manage pancreatic duct stones.
Conclusion: EUS and ERCP can be safely used to diagnose chronic pancreatitis
in pediatric patients and assist in management of chronic pancreatitis-related
complications. Procedure-related risks are similar to those seen in adults, with
EUS having a safer risk profile overall. The recent increase in pediatric-trained
specialists will improve access of these modalities for children.",False,,True,3.0

Nose (Icd932), Pharynx And Larynx (Icd933) Trachea, Bronchi And Lungs (Icd934), Mouth, Esophagus And Stomach (Icd935). Age And Gender Injury Distributions Were Assessed. Data Regarding Adult Supervision And Activity Before Injury Were Also Evaluated. Fbs Which Most Frequently Cause Complications Were Identified. The Association Between Children Age, Adult Presence, Object Characteristics And Hospitalization/Complications Was Computed Using Unweighted Odds Ratios And The Related 95% Confidence Intervals. Results: 16,878 Fb Injuries Occurred In Children Aged 0-14 Years Have Been Recorded In The Susy Safe Databases. Fb Type Was Specified In 10,564 Cases; Among Them 2744(26%) Were Due To A Food Item. Fb Site Was Recorded In 1344 Cases: Fb Was Located In The Ears In 99 Patients, While 1140 Occurred In The Upper And Lower Respiratory Tract; Finally, 105 Food Items Were Removed From Mouth, Esophagus And Stomach. Complications Occurred In 176 Cases And The Most Documented Was Pulmonary Or Bronchial Infections (23%) Followed Emphysema Or Atelectasis And By And Asthma (7%). Bones Were The Commonest Retrieved Ffb Encountered In This Study, While Nuts Seem To Be The Ffb Most Frequently Associated To Complications. Conclusions: On The Basis Of This Study We Make The Strong Recommendation That Parents Should Be Adequately Educated And Provide Age-Appropriate Food To Their Children And Be Present In Order To Supervise Them During Eating Especially During A Critical Period Ranging From 2 To 3 Years Of Age.
