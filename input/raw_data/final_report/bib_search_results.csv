The majority of foreign bodies are passed smoothly with no problems if they passed the esophagus, however some may be lodged in areas of anatomical narrowing which may require endoscopic or surgical intervention. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year -old mentally abnormal woman presented to the emergency department complaining from abdominal pain for 2 days. The family reported a history of ingestion of multiple metallic nails one week before presentation. Abdominal examination showed generalized tenderness and guarding. Plain abdominal X-ray showed multiple metallic nails in the upper abdomen and the right lower abdomen. Laparotomy was performed, one of the nails was causing perforation of the gastric wall, huge number of metallic nails were extracted from the stomach and cecum, appendectomy was performed.

There is limited understanding of the impact of adult FBI in Australia. We aim to evaluate patient characteristics, outcomes and hospital costs of FBI. Design A retrospective cohort study of patients with FBI was performed at a non-prison referral centre in Melbourne, Australia. International Classification of Disease-10 coding identified patients with gastrointestinal FBI over financial years 2018–2021. Exclusion criteria were food bolus, medication foreign body, object in anus or rectum, or non-ingestion. Criteria for ‘emergent’ classification were oesophagus, size >6 cm, disc batteries, airway compromise, peritonitis, sepsis and/or suspected viscus perforation. Results Thirty-two admissions attributed to 26 patients were included. The median age was 36 years (IQR: 27–56), 58% were male and 35% had a prior psychiatric or autism spectrum disorder. There were no deaths, perforations or surgery. Gastroscopy was performed in 16 admissions and 1 was scheduled following discharge. Rat-tooth forceps were used in 31% and an overtube was used in 3 cases. The median time from presentation to gastroscopy was 673 minutes (IQR: 380–1013). Management was adherent to European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines in 81%. After excluding admissions with FBI as a secondary diagnosis, median admission cost was $A1989 (IQR: $A643–$A4976) and total admission costs over the 3 years was $A84 448. Conclusion FBI in an Australian, non-prison referral centre is infrequent, can often be safely managed expectantly, and has limited impact on healthcare utilisation. Early, outpatient endoscopy could be considered for non-urgent cases, which may reduce costs while maintaining safety.","2023-02-01","2025-03-30 10:21:11","2025-03-30 10:21:11","2025-03-30 10:21:11","e001087","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","en","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

Case Presentation:            The authors present the case of a 39-year-old man who arrived at the hospital with symptoms of abdominal distension and occasional black stools for a week. The patient was known to have schizophrenia but had not received regular hospital follow-up or treatment for the past 5 years. He had a history of exogenous stimulation, which led him to surreptitiously swallow metallic objects. Upon physical examination, he displayed abdominal distension and mild tenderness in the upper abdomen. Radiographs revealed multiple foreign objects in his stomach, leading to the decision for laparotomy, gastric opening, and removal of the foreign objects under general anesthesia.           Clinical Discussion:            Mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and multiple substance abuse, are recognized as being significant risk factors for ingesting foreign bodies. In such cases, it is crucial to intervene quickly. For patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms, the involvement of family caregivers is of even greater importance than endoscopic or surgical treatments.           Conclusion:            Foreign body ingestion is more prevalent in individuals with psychosis, highlighting the importance of ongoing care and follow-up for patients with mental illness.","2023-04","2025-03-30 10:22:52","2025-03-30 10:22:52","2025-03-30 10:22:52","1270","","4","85","","","Metallic foreign bodies ingestion by schizophrenic patient","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","journals.lww.com","","","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/UNQQD4FS/Jin et al. - 2023 - Metallic foreign bodies ingestion by schizophrenic.pdf; /Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/TRLLHEDK/metallic_foreign_bodies_ingestion_by_schizophrenic.130.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there may be difficulty locating FBs and complications associated with their removal. This study aimed to identify risk factors and complications correlated to the presence and removal of FBs. Methods This 5-year retrospective study enrolled 1,311 patients between June 2014 and April 2019. Demographic and endoscopic data were collected, containing age, gender, types and location of FBs, duration of FB ingestion, accessory devices, endoscopic methods, and complications. Logistic regression analysis was applied to evaluate the predictive risk factors. Results Among 1,131 patients, FBs were found in 90.16% of cases. A major predictor for the presence of FB was a presentation of less than 24 hours (h). The types of FBs were jujube pits (36.72%) and fish bones (22.00%), and over 80% of the FBs were discovered in the esophagus. Complications were found in 239 cases (20.22%), of which hemorrhage (162/239, 67.78%) was the most frequent. Age ≥60, duration ≥24 h, and FBs ingested in the esophagus were considered as risk factors for developing complications. Conclusions In conclusion, the longer duration, age ≥60, and impaction in the esophagus were risk factors for developing complications following the ingestion of FBs. These factors should be considered when developing assessment and treatment plans in the management of FB ingestion.","2021-03","2025-03-30 10:32:01","2025-03-30 10:32:12","2025-03-30 10:32:01","502","","6","9","","Ann Transl Med","The removal of foreign body ingestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 33850899 PMCID: PMC8039707","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/E5LBR3M3/Wang et al. - 2021 - The removal of foreign body ingestion in the upper.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8039707/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These thoughts were ego-dystonic and kept on hammering her mind until she ate it. She was diagnosed as having Major Depressive Disorder with relational problems and pica. We prescribed her escitalopram with clonazepam and asked her to ventilate her feelings during stressful situations.

However, some patients with esophageal foreign body ingestion do not come to the hospital immediately and may delay medical intervention from the time of ingestion. The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of adults with suspected esophageal foreign body ingestion according to the time of ingestion and types of foreign bodies. A total of 326 adult patients (151 men and 175 women) were analyzed, and divided into two groups according to the time period: within or beyond 24 hours from ingestion to endoscopic intervention. A total of 172 patients (52.7%) were found to have ingested foreign bodies; 73.5% were removed smoothly, 10.3% were treated by push technique and 16.0% with failed retrieval received alternative treatments. A higher proportion of patients in the beyond-24 hours group suffered from odynophagia (25.9 vs. 12.9%, P < 0.05). Negative identification of esophageal foreign bodies was more frequent in the beyond-24 hours group (67 vs. 40.2%, P < 0.05), but these patients showed higher proportions of esophageal ulcers (21.1 vs. 7.2%, P < 0.05). The beyond-24 hours group also showed a significantly higher rate of foreign bodies in the lower esophagus (40.0 vs. 15.3%, P < 0.05). Patients with esophageal food bolus impaction had significant delayed endoscopic intervention, longer therapeutic endoscopic time, higher proportions of esophageal cancer, stricture and fewer complications. Endoscopic intervention within 24 hours from the time of ingestion should be considered early in adults, because delaying intervention may produce more symptomatic esophageal ulcerations with odynophagia.","2011-04","2025-04-14 10:55:48","2025-04-14 10:55:50","","131-137","","3","24","","Dis Esophagus","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 20946132","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20946132","","Humans; Adult; Aged; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Time Factors; Adolescent; Aged, 80 and over; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult; Esophagus; Foreign Bodies; Food; Esophagoscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Foreign body ingestions in prisoners are always intentional and inmates can be manipulative, which makes medical decision even more difficult. Our objective is to propose a decisional algorithm for management of foreign body ingestion in prisoners. We reviewed the records of 198 admissions for foreign body ingestion for a 10-year period. Type and number of ingested foreign bodies, radiographic findings, outcome as well as the management method including conservative, endoscopic removal, or surgical treatment were analyzed. Most cases were managed conservatively (87.6%). Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract was performed in 37 cases with a success rate of 46 per cent. In 9.3 per cent of cases, the final treatment was endoscopic. Only five patients required surgical treatment, being emergent just in one case. We advocate conservative treatment for asymptomatic patients with foreign body ingestion. Endoscopic removal is proposed for pointed objects or objects bigger than 2.5 cm located in the stomach. Objects longer than 6 to 8 cm located in the stomach should be removed by endoscopy or laparoscopy. Patients with objects in the small bowel or colon should be treated conservatively unless there are complications or they fail to progress.","2014-02","2025-04-14 10:56:28","2025-04-14 10:56:28","","131-137","","2","80","","Am Surg","Ingested foreign bodies","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24480212","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480212","","Humans; Adult; Retrospective Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Cohort Studies; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult; Hospitalization; Follow-Up Studies; Radiography; Gastrointestinal Tract; Incidence; Endoscopy; Foreign Bodies; Prisoners; Deglutition; Laparotomy; Risk Assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This retrospective study evaluated the 10-year experience of a single hospital in China performing emergency removal of ingested foreign bodies in 586 adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2011 and 2020, medical records of 642 adults with a diagnosis of foreign bodies ingestion were retrospectively screened. The timing of endoscopic intervention was classified according to ESGE recommendations. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS We included 586 patients. The median (range) diameter of foreign bodies was 2.5 (1-24) cm: for sharp ones it was 2.5 (1.5-4.0) cm and for long ones it was 16.9 (10-24) cm. The most common site of foreign body lodgment was the esophagus (n=481; 82.1%); 45.6% (n=252) received emergent removal within 6 hours, while 32.2% (n=178) underwent urgent removal within 24 hours. There were 583 (99.5%) foreign bodies removed successfully and the complication rate was 17.9%. Major complications occurred in 45 patients (7.7%). Female sex and non-emergent endoscopy after 6 hours were significantly associated with a higher overall complications rate. For major complications, older age, time interval >24 hours, and sharper objects were associated with major complications. CONCLUSIONS The findings from this retrospective study support the ESGE statement that endoscopic removal of ingested foreign bodies from the upper GI tract within 6 hours reduces complication rates for adults in the emergency setting.","2022-07-26","2025-04-14 10:57:23","2025-04-14 10:57:23","","e936463","","","28","","Med Sci Monit","Emergency Removal of Ingested Foreign Bodies in 586 Adults at a Single Hospital in China According to the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) Recommendations","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35879885 PMCID: PMC9339224","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/2JL4QNG7/Liu et al. - 2022 - Emergency Removal of Ingested Foreign Bodies in 58.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35879885","","Humans; Adult; Retrospective Studies; Female; Hospitals; China; Endoscopy; Foreign Bodies; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: All patients except two were symptomatic and 145 of them were younger than 14 years of age. Plain films were performed in every patient with a suspected esophageal foreign body (EFB). In all patients, rigid esophagoscopy was done under general anesthesia once the diagnosis of impacted EFB is made. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of the foreign bodies were coins. In children, the majority of impacted esophageal foreign bodies were located at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle while in adults the site of impaction was the lower esophageal sphincter. The most common symptoms were vomiting and or regurgitation. Of the 180 EFBs encountered, 169 were extracted endoscopically, five were pushed into the stomach, five were not found, and one patient needed cervicotomy. There were no deaths in this series. Predisposing factors were found in 15 patients. Fifteen patients (8.3%) had benign strictures. In ten patients (5.5%), minor complications were encountered, none of which were esophagoscopically related. Alternative diagnostic and therapeutic modalities are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: All patients with a history of suspected foreign body ingestion should have direct endoscopic examination. If the EFB is not detected a thorough radiographic examination, including CT scan, should be performed to detect a possible intra- or extraluminal object. Preservation of the airway is regarded to be the most important consideration in esophageal foreign body management.","1998-05","2025-04-14 11:00:18","2025-04-14 11:00:20","","494-498","","5","13","","Eur J Cardiothorac Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 9663527","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/WQ58GQGU/Al-Qudah et al. - 1998 - Esophageal foreign bodies.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9663527","","Humans; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Adolescent; Child; Esophagus; Child, Preschool; Infant; Foreign Bodies; Esophagoscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Successful endoscopic treatment was achieved in more than 90% of the cases, with adverse events occurring in fewer than 5%. Foreign body forceps was the preferred device in foreign body ingestion, while retrieval basket and mobilisation were preferred in food impaction. The need to use more than one instrument was significantly higher in food impaction. CONCLUSION: Foreign bodies are encountered at endoscopy in almost half of the cases. Older age and earlier presentation are independent predictors of its presence. Given the high proportion of patients with foreign body at endoscopy and the low risk of complications, endoscopic evaluation is probably justified in the majority of cases.","2018-08","2025-04-14 12:24:03","2025-04-14 12:24:03","","974-980","","7","6","","United European Gastroenterol J","Foreign body ingestion and food impaction in adults","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30228884 PMCID: PMC6137585","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/3VI7KWN6/Libânio et al. - 2018 - Foreign body ingestion and food impaction in adult.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30228884","","Endoscopy; food impaction; emergency; foreign body ingestion; therapeutic endoscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The natural propensities of living beings to pain and pleasure, being a subject of life, and having specific good and interest (as proposed by Singer, Regan, Tayler, and Goodpaster, respectively), have been taken as a reason to determine the moral status of the beings in question. This article makes the case that none of them can offer all-inclusive ideal for biocentrism to embrace all life forms as moral patients since they are either exclusive, hierarchical, or imprecise. To this end, I argue that it is possible to drive a unifying ideal from Schopenhauer’s metaphysics: the will to live. The will to live is a quality that all living beings share, regardless of their abilities and propensities. Both conscious and unconscious beings, sentient and non-sentient creatures, lower animals and plants are the embodi­ments or physical forms of the ultimate reality that is the will to live. Thus, biocentrism becomes more valid and effective in environmental preservation by incorporating the will to live into its ethical principle.","2022-04-01","2025-04-14 12:38:25","2025-04-14 12:38:29","2025-04-14 12:38:25","15-25","","1","36","","","The Will to Live and Reverence for Life","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pdcnet.org","","","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/AZNG6LFN/Mesfin - 2022 - The Will to Live and Reverence for Life A Philoso.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In adults, foreign body ingestion is more common in the elderly, individuals with mental illness or who have an intellectual disability, alcohol poisoning, prison inmates, and drug traffickers. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 22 year old male patient who presented with abdominal distension and vomiting of ingested matter of two to three episodes per day of one month duration. He is a known schizophrenic patient for the past three years and has been on follow up at a nearby hospital. He swallowed metallic nails in an attempt to kill himself. On abdominal examination there was distension, and epigastric tenderness. His plain abdominal x-ray showed multiple radiopaque foreign body in the stomach. Similarly, abdominal ultrasound showed thickened gastric wall and multiple linear foreign bodies in the stomach. Then, with the impression of gastric outlet obstruction secondary to foreign body in the stomach, laparotomy plus gastrotomy plus foreign body removal and repair were done under general anesthesia. Dilated stomach, palpable mass on distal stomach and first part of duodenum, and adhesion between stomach, abdominal wall and liver was found intra operatively.

Emergent endoscopy (EGD) is usually performed in the emergency department (ED), operating room (OR), intensive care unit (ICU), or endoscopy suite. However, because the endoscopy suite is not always available, this study investigated the impact of location outside of the endoscopy suite on the successful removal of ingested foreign bodies and other patient outcomes. Methodology We reviewed charts of patients who underwent EGD for foreign body removal at an academic quaternary center between January 01, 2012, and December 31, 2020. We defined successful EGD as retrieval of the foreign body at the first attempt and not requiring subsequent endoscopy or surgical intervention. We performed descriptive and inferential statistical analyses and conducted classification and regression trees to compare endoscopy procedure length (EPL) and hospital length of stay (HLOS) between different locations. Results We analyzed 77 patients, of whom 13 (17%) underwent endoscopy in the ICU, 46 (60%) in the OR, and 18 (23%) in the ED. Endoscopic removal failed in four (5%) patients. Endoscopy length was significantly shorter in the OR (67 (48-122) minutes) versus the ICU (158 (95-166) minutes, P = 0.004) and the ED (111 (92-155) minutes, P = 0.009). Time to procedure was similar if the procedure was performed in the ED (278 minutes), the ICU (331 minutes), or the OR (378 minutes). The median (interquartile range) of HLOS for the OR group (0.87 (0.54-2.03) days) was significantly shorter than the ICU group (2.26 (1.47-6.91) days, P = 0.007). Conclusions While performing endoscopy for esophageal foreign body removal in the OR may be associated with a shorter EPL and HLOS, no location was inferior for overall outcomes. Further prospective and randomized studies are needed to confirm our findings.","2022-02","2025-04-14 12:44:49","2025-04-14 12:44:50","","e21929","","2","14","","Cureus","Emergent Endoscopy for Esophageal Foreign Body Removal","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35273870 PMCID: PMC8900722","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/CYP9YSW6/Sagvand et al. - 2022 - Emergent Endoscopy for Esophageal Foreign Body Rem.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35273870","","endoscopy; food impaction; esophageal foreign body; emergent endoscopy; location of endoscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the incidence of FBs requiring operative removal varies from 1% to 14%, it was decided to perform this study and compare the data with those from the world literature, as well as to outline an algorithm for management, including indications for surgery. We reviewed all patients with FB ingestion from 1973 to 1993. There were 542 patients with 1203 ingestions, aged 15 to 82 years. Among them, 69.9% (n= 379) were jail inmates at the time of ingestion, 22.9% (n= 124) had a history of psychosis, and 7.2% (n= 39) were alcoholics or denture-wearing elderly subjects. Most foreign bodies passed spontaneously (75.6%;n= 410). Endoscopic removal was possible in 19.5% (n= 106) and was not associated with any morbidity. Only 4.8% (n= 26) required surgery. Of the latter, 30.8% (n= 8) had long gastric FBs with no tendency for distal passage and were removed via gastrotomy; 15.4% (n= 4) had thin, sharp FBs, causing perforation; and 53.8% (n= 14) had FBs impacted in the ileocecal region, which were removed via appendicostomy. Conservative approach to FB ingestion is justified, although early endoscopic removal from the stomach is recommended. In cases of failure, surgical removal for gastric FBs longer than 7.0 cm is wise. Thin, sharp FBs require a high index of suspicion because they carry a higher risk for perforation. The ileocecal region is the most common site of impaction. Removal of the FB via appendicostomy is the safest option and should not be delayed more than 48 hours.","1996","2025-04-14 12:57:20","2025-04-14 12:57:20","2025-04-14 12:57:20","1001-1005","","8","20","","","Ingested Foreign Bodies of the Gastrointestinal Tract","","","","","","","en","© 1996 International Society of Surgery","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1007/s002689900152","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/D4REPSB4/s002689900152.html","","","Foreign Body; Common Site; Elderly Subject; High Risk; Retrospective Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients with esophageal foreign bodies were not included in the study group. A 10-year experience is reported. Each patient's physical examination findings at presentation, white blood cell count, length of hospital stay, number and types of foreign bodies ingested, endoscopic interventions, surgical interventions, and complications were reviewed. There were 75 separate hospitalizations, all occurring in 22 male prison inmates. A total of 256 foreign bodies were ingested. Patients incurred 281 hospitalization days (average 3.7 days per admission). One patient had signs of peritonitis. White blood cell count was less than 10 K/μL in 85%. Sixty-four endoscopies were performed with removal of 79 of 163 foreign bodies (48% success rate). Five patients required general anesthesia because of a lack of cooperation. Complications occurred in four of them, one requiring laparotomy. Eight additional laparotomies were performed. One was performed for an acute abdomen on admission and one for the development of an acute abdomen after conservative management. Two were performed to remove metal bezoars. Four additional laparotomies were performed because of surgeon preference. Among the 23 patients admitted and managed conservatively, 77 (97%) of 79 foreign bodies passed spontaneously. One patient required laparotomy. Of the 256 ingested foreign bodies, 79 were removed endoscopically, 71 were removed surgically, and 106 passed spontaneously. The size, shape, and number were not predictive of the ability to transit the gastrointestinal tract. Foreign body ingestion is problematic in prison inmates. With conservative management, most foreign bodies will pass spontaneously. Endoscopy has a high failure rate and is associated with significant complications.

METHODS: Patients older than 16 years of age who presented to the ED between January 1(st) and December 31(st) of 2010 with complaints related to swallowed foreign bodies were identified from electronic health records and patient charts. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients presented with a complaint of foreign body ingestion during the study period. Overall, an X-ray was performed on 75 patients, and a fiberoptic evaluation was performed on 45 patients. A foreign body was detected in 46 (46%) patients. The diagnostic yield of the X-ray was 27 (36%) out of 75 patients, while the diagnostic yield of the fiberoptic evaluations was 21 (47%) out of 45 patients. The detected foreign bodies were mostly located in the esophagus (17 out of 46 foreign bodies detected). When the types of ingested foreign bodies were evaluated, 52 (52%) patients reported ingesting food, and 19 (19%) patients reported swallowing pins. An X-ray was performed on 33 patients with accidental food ingestions but yielded a positive result in only two cases. In 12 out of 21 patients with accidental food ingestion who underwent fiberoptic evaluation, the foreign material was detected and removed. CONCLUSION: Plain radiography is helpful in the localization of radiopaque swollen foreign bodies, while fiberoptic methods are useful as both diagnostic and therapeutic tools, regardless of radiopacity.","2013-10-14","2025-04-14 13:03:56","2025-04-14 13:03:57","","6447-6452","","38","19","","World J Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24151363 PMCID: PMC3801315","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/89X6C6CX/Erbil et al. - 2013 - Emergency admissions due to swallowed foreign bodi.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24151363","","Humans; Adult; Aged; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Emergency Service, Hospital; Adolescent; Aged, 80 and over; Prognosis; Young Adult; Ingestion; Emergency; Radiography; Foreign body; Predictive Value of Tests; Endoscopy; Foreign Bodies; Deglutition; Gastrointestinal tract; Fiber Optic Technology; Patient Admission","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the present study was to report the experience of management of upper gastrointestinal foreign bodies by endoscopy in a large center. All patients who presented at the Department of Gastroenterology at Nanfang Hospital (Guangzhou, China) with complaints regarding upper gastrointestinal (GI) foreign body ingestion from December 1987 to December 2013. Hospital medical charts and endoscopic records were examined to evaluate etiology, treatment, and outcomes for these patients. A total of 846 patients were enrolled in the present study, from which foreign bodies were detected in 737 (87.1%) patients via X-ray or endoscopy. The objects most frequently ingested were bones (n=395, 53.6%). The detected foreign bodies were predominantly located in the cervical esophagus (n=325, 44.1%). Endoscopic foreign body extraction was successful in 92.5% of cases, whereas surgery was required in 6 patients. The most frequently used endoscopic accessory devices were retrieval forceps (n=480, 65.1%). The complication rate was 6.9%, including mucosal laceration (n=10) and others, all of which were managed conservatively.

METHODS: Three hundred sixteen cases with foreign bodies in the oesophagus were retrospectively investigated. The predictive risk factors for complications after foreign body ingestion were analysed by multivariate logistic regression, and included age, size and type of foreign body ingested, duration of impaction, and the level of foreign body impaction. RESULTS: The types of oesophageal foreign bodies included fish bones (37.0%), food (19.0%), and metals (18.4%). The complications associated with foreign bodies were ulcers (21.2%), lacerations (14.9%), erosions (12.0%), and perforation (1.9%).

The aim of this paper is to report the management and the outcomes in 67 patients admitted for suspected ingestion of foreign body between December 2012 and December 2014. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at Palermo University Hospitals, Italy, over a 2-year period. We reviewed patients' database (age, sex, type of foreign body and its anatomical location, treatments, and outcomes as complications, success rates, and mortalities). RESULTS: Foreign bodies were found in all of our 67 patients. Almost all were found in the stomach and lower esophagus (77 %). The types of foreign body were very different, but they were chiefly meat boluses, fishbones or cartilages, button battery and dental prostheses. In all patients it was possible to endoscopically remove the foreign body. Complications related to the endoscopic procedure were unfrequent (about 7 %) and have been treated conservatively. 5.9 % of patients had previous esophageal or laryngeal surgery, and 8.9 % had an underlying esophageal disease, such as a narrowing, dismotility or achalasia. CONCLUSION: Our experience with foreign bodies and food impaction emphasizes the importance of endoscopic approach and removal, simple and secure when performed by experienced hands and under conscious sedation in most cases. High success rates, lower incidence of minor complications, reduction of the need of surgery and reduced hospitalization time are the strengths of the endoscopic approach.","2016-11-04","2025-04-14 13:08:42","2025-04-14 13:08:42","","42","","1","16","","BMC Emerg Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27809769 PMCID: PMC5095952","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/L9I23E98/Geraci et al. - 2016 - Retrospective analysis of management of ingested f.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27809769","","Humans; Adult; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Age Factors; Sex Factors; Risk Factors; Young Adult; Emergencies; Italy; Foreign body; Foreign Bodies; Food; Hospitals, University; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal; Endoscopic management; Food bolus impaction; Upper endoscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 159 adult patients with confirmed diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal FBs who received endoscopic management in the emergency department. RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 57.0 ± 19.2 years, and 66 (37.7%) of the patients were 65 years or older. Majority had a clear history and symptoms of FB ingestion. However, 9 (5.7%) initially ignored the accidental swallowing of FBs and were diagnosed late. The mean time spent for diagnosis was 1.8 days in those with uncertain history. Only 47.1% of those with radiographic studies had positive findings. Fish bones, press-through package and dentures were the most common culprits in this population of Asian elderly. Majority of FBs were located in the esophagus, especially in the upper third. Endoscopic FB extraction was successful in 96.9% of cases, while surgery was required in only 5 patients. The complication rate was 6.9%, including mucosal laceration (n = 10) and suspected perforation (n = 1), all of which were successfully managed conservatively. There was no death due to FB ingestion or endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: In FB ingestion, history usually points toward the diagnosis. Patients with an uncertain history are usually diagnosed late, and plain radiography cannot reliably predict the presence of FB.

Methods to handle such problems continue to evolve offering advantages, such as the avoidance of surgery, reduced cost, improved visualization, reduced morbidity, and high removal success rate. However, to date, no studies have evaluated the endoscopic management of FBs in Japan. AIM: To elucidate level of safety and efficacy in the endoscopic management of FBs and FBI. METHODS: A total of 215 procedures were performed at Keio University Hospital between November 2007 and August 2018. Data were collected from medical charts, and endoscopic details were collected from an endoscopic reporting system. Procedures performed with a flexible gastrointestinal endoscope were only taken into account. Patients who underwent a technique involving FB or FBI from the digestive tract were only included. Data on patient sex, patient age, outpatient, inpatient, FB type, FB location, procedure time, procedure type, removal device type, success, and technical complications were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Among the 215 procedures, 136 (63.3%) were performed in old adults (≥ 60 years), 180 (83.7%) procedures were performed in outpatients. The most common type of FBs were press-through-pack (PTP) medications [72 (33.5%) cases], FBI [47 (21.9%)], Anisakis parasite (AP) [41 (19.1%) cases]. Most FBs were located in the esophagus [130 (60.5%) cases] followed by the stomach [68 (31.6%) cases]. AP was commonly found in the stomach [39 (57.4%) cases], and it was removed using biopsy forceps in 97.5% of the cases. The most common FBs according to anatomical location were PTP medications (40%) and dental prostheses (DP) (40%) in the laryngopharynx, PTP (48.5%) in the esophagus, AP (57.4%) in the stomach, DP (37.5%) in the small intestine and video capsule endoscopy device (75%) in the colon. A transparent cap with grasping forceps was the most commonly used device [82 (38.1%) cases]. The success rate of the procedure was 100%, and complication were observed in only one case (0.5%).

DFBI  was associated with substance use in 5/12 incidents, and with precipitants  (experiencing strong emotions, witnessing self-harm) in 4/12 incidents. Most  DFBI involved sharp objects (razor blades, glass, safety pins). Medical  intervention was initially active (endoscopy/surgery) but progressed to a more  conservative, observational approach. Psychological management was initially  restrictive, but also changed over time to focus on identifying distress,  enhancing coping mechanisms and patient responsibility.

Definition, scope, benefits, and risks","BMC psychiatry","","1471-244X","10.1186/s12888-016-0970-y","","BACKGROUND: As a significant proportion of patients receiving palliative care suffer from states of anxiety, depression, delirium, or other mental symptoms, psychiatry and palliative care already collaborate closely in the palliative care of medical conditions. Despite this well-established involvement of psychiatrists in palliative care, psychiatry does not currently explicitly provide palliative care for patients with mental illness outside the context of terminal medical illness. DISCUSSION: Based on the WHO definition of palliative care, a, a working definition of palliative psychiatry is proposed. Palliative psychiatry focuses on mental health rather than medical/physical issues. We propose that the beneficiaries of palliative psychiatry are patients with severe persistent mental illness, who are at risk of therapeutic neglect and/or overly aggressive care within current paradigms. These include long-term residential care patients with severe chronic schizophrenia and insufficient quality of life, those with therapy-refractory depressions and repeated suicide attempts, and those with severe long-standing therapy-refractory anorexia nervosa. An explicitly palliative approach within psychiatry has the potential to improve quality of care, person-centredness, outcomes, and autonomy for patients with severe persistent mental illness. CONCLUSIONS: The first step towards a palliative psychiatry is to acknowledge those palliative approaches that already exist implicitly in psychiatry. Basic skills for a palliative psychiatry include communication of diagnosis and prognosis, symptom assessment and management, support for advance (mental health) care planning, assessment of caregiver needs, and referral to specialized services. Some of these may already be considered core skills of psychiatrists, but for a truly palliative approach they should be exercised guided by an awareness of the limited functional prognosis and lifespan of patients with severe persistent mental illness.","2016-07-22","2025-04-14 13:16:08","2025-04-14 13:16:08","","260","","","16","","BMC Psychiatry","Palliative psychiatry for severe persistent mental illness as a new approach to psychiatry?","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27450328 PMCID: PMC4957930","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/UZDM4ENN/Trachsel et al. - 2016 - Palliative psychiatry for severe persistent mental.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27450328","","Humans; Psychiatry; Quality of life; Quality of Life; Palliative Care; Chronic Disease; End of life; Palliative care; Terminal care; Mental Disorders; Referral and Consultation; Caregivers; Cooperative Behavior; Futility; Palliative sedation; Risk; Severe persistent mental illness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, the authors have reviewed the available literature for similar cases. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Less than 1% of patients need surgical removal, 10-20% need to be taken out endoscopically, and the remaining pass spontaneously. Plain radiography is the most available imaging modality detecting the number, material, and estimated place of the alimentary canal trapped.

In this case of young female with impacted bunch of bangles in the stomach and few in the small and large bowel, who was completely asymptomatic, needed gastrotomy with enterotomy for complete and successful retrieval of glass bangles.","2008-06","2025-04-14 13:23:47","2025-04-14 13:23:47","","144-146","","3","70","","Indian J Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23133044 PMCID: PMC3452446","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/LPTN6WUG/Kariholu et al. - 2008 - Pica - a case of acuphagia or hyalophagia.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23133044","","Pica; Acuphagia; Hyalophagia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although most cases have a clear history, foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract can be an unexpected finding after operations for other conditions. This study compares the clinical presentations and outcomes for patients requiring or not requiring operations. Between January 1998 and December 2001, 80 patients with foreign body ingestion were included and divided into two groups. Specifically, group 1 patients were managed nonoperatively, and group 2 patients were managed operatively. The patient demographics, symptoms, foreign body ingestion mechanisms, type of diagnostic studies and management, and outcomes were compared between the two groups. Group 1 contained 44 patients, and group 2 contained 36 patients. Group 1 patients were significantly younger, but the incidence of underlying disease and the proportion of patients who ingested foreign bodies intentionally or incidentally was similar in groups 1 and 2. Most of the ingested foreign bodies in group 1 were in the esophagus and stomach, but for group 2 patients they were mostly in the small bowel. Moreover, most of group 1 patients were asymptomatic, which was not the case in group 2. Most group 2 patients had no known history of foreign body ingestion, and diagnoses generally were established during surgery. Neither group of patients displayed any mortality. Nonoperative management of foreign body ingestion usually can succeed in asymptomatic patients with a clear history; however, ingested foreign bodies can cause serious problems for those patients without a clear history of foreign body ingestion.","2005","2025-04-14 13:25:19","2025-04-14 13:25:19","","99-102","","2","90","","Int Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 16119715","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16119715","","Humans; Adult; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Age Factors; Adolescent; Treatment Outcome; Child; Child, Preschool; Infant; Foreign Bodies; Mental Disorders; Deglutition; Digestive System; Digestive System Surgical Procedures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract are important morbid and mortal clinical conditions. Particularly, emergency treatment is required for cutting and drilling bodies. The majority of ingested foreign bodies (80-90%) leave gastrointestinal tract without creating problems. In 10-20% of cases, intervention is absolutely required. Less than 1% of cases need surgery. In this paper, we present a schizophrenia patient who swallowed multiple lighters. Case. A 21-year-old male schizophrenic patient who uses psychotic drugs presented to the emergency department with the complaints of abdominal pain, severe vomiting, and inability to swallow for a week. His physical examination revealed epigastric tenderness. A plain radiograph of the abdomen revealed multiple tiny metallic densities. Gastroscopy was performed. The lighters were not allowing the passage, and some of them had penetrated the gastric mucosa, and bezoars were observed. One lighter was extracted with the help of the polypectomy snare. Other lighters as a bezoar were removed by surgery. Conclusion. Excessive vomiting of swallowed foreign bodies in the etiology of psychotic patients should be kept in mind. Endoscopic therapy can be performed in the early stages in these patients, but in the late stage surgery is inevitable.","2016","2025-04-14 13:25:53","2025-04-14 13:25:53","","6301302","","","2016","","Case Rep Gastrointest Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27525133 PMCID: PMC4972918","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/BUT7PMSK/Atayan et al. - 2016 - Lighter Ingestion as an Uncommon Cause of Severe V.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27525133","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most ingested sharp metallic bodies pass through the digestive tract spontaneously and patients can be managed conservatively. Sometimes, however, perforation develops and surgical treatment is necessary. It is hard to localize ingested sewing needles because they tend to scatter widely in the digestive tract and are impalpable manually. We report a psychiatric patient who ingested six sewing needles: one intact needle was found at the larynx, one had penetrated into the stomach, one was in the duodenum, one was in the cecum, one was broken into two pieces, and the final needle was broken into three pieces. All of the broken fragments were in the colon. The needle at the larynx was removed by a laryngoscope. Subsequently, we used mini C-arm fluoroscopy to localize the remaining needles and successfully removed all of them intraoperatively.","2006-09","2025-04-14 13:27:06","2025-04-14 13:27:06","","457-460","","9","22","","Kaohsiung J Med Sci","Successful localization and surgical removal of ingested sewing needles under mini C-arm fluoroscopy","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 17000447","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17000447","","Humans; Aged; Male; Foreign Bodies; Needles; Fluoroscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, multiple sharply pointed foreign bodies located in different organs are rare conditions and no definite treatment guidelines has been established. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 31-year-old amateur magician visited the outpatient clinic with a chief complaint of epigastric discomfort. He might have accidentally swallowed some needles while practicing a magic trick 2 days before. DIAGNOSIS: Imaging tests revealed 1 needle was stuck in the left liver lobe through the stomach wall, 1 was in the third portion of the duodenum, 3 were in the ascending colon, and 2 were in the transverse colon. INTERVENTIONS: A needle in the duodenum and 5 in the colon were removed by endoscopy. The needle stuck in the liver from the stomach was not visible inside the stomach and was successfully removed by laparoscopy a few days later. OUTCOMES: The patient was able to tolerate an oral diet and was discharged on postoperative day 4 without any complications. LESSONS: Developing a treatment plan in cases of multiple sharp FB may be difficult. A multidisciplinary team of endoscopists and surgeons is needed to determine the best possible treatment plan.

Work-up revealed copper deficiency (copper level of <0.05 microg/ml) and elevated zinc levels (280 microg/ml). The zinc toxicity was produced by the zinc content in the coins ingested by the patient over a period of many years. He was initially treated with -acetylcysteine and sodium bicarbonate followed by intravenous copper sulfate. He was also placed on Adolph's meat tenderizer and pancreatin thrice a day orally to loosen the massive amount of metallic objects including coins in his bowel and allow them to pass out in his feces. He was also continued on oral copper sulfate. His copper levels began to rise and reached a maximum of 0.72 microg/ml, and his zinc level fell to 153 microg/ml. However, as he refused surgery to remove the metal objects from his bowel and continued to ingest more coins, there was continued absorption of zinc, which later overcame the efforts to reduce the zinc level and increase copper levels in his blood.

Thirty-nine were in the pharynx, 181 in the esophagus, 19 in the stomach, and 3 in the small bowel. The flexible panendoscope was used 211 times (87.2%) to manage these foreign bodies, while the rigid esophagoscope was used 12 times (5.0%). Two hundred thirty-nine foreign bodies (98.8%) were successfully managed endoscopically. The surgery rate was 0.4%. There was no morbidity or mortality. Twenty-five percent of the cases were done under general endotracheal anesthesia. Coins in the esophagus are removed promptly if in the cervical or mid esophagus, and within 12 hours if in the distal esophagus. Once in the stomach, they will usually pass without difficulty. Meat impaction resulting in an obstructed esophagus is an urgent problem and the bolus should be removed within hours. Sharp and pointed foreign bodies can be very difficult to manage. Dry runs with a reproduction of the foreign body are essential to successful removal. Button batteries lodged in the esophagus represent an emergency and should be removed without delay. Once in the stomach, they will usually pass through the gastrointestinal tract without difficulty. The forward-viewing flexible panendoscope has become the instrument of choice in managing foreign bodies in most tertiary medical centers as well as in the community hospitals.","1995-01","2025-04-14 13:32:48","2025-04-14 13:32:48","","39-51","","1","41","","Gastrointest Endosc","Management of foreign bodies of the upper gastrointestinal tract","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 7698623","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7698623","","Humans; Stomach; Esophagus; Foreign Bodies; Digestive System; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal; Intestine, Small","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Foreign body injury (FBI) most commonly occurs in children younger than 6 years, and the incidence of FBI has increased in recent years. The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the characteristics of FBI due to ingestion and aspiration. METHODS: Data from patients who were hospitalized for FB ingestion and/or aspiration and underwent rigid bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy from 2008 to 2011 were retrospectively evaluated. Foreign body in the upper aerodigestive tract was evaluated with respect to the characteristics of patients, clinical presentation, management strategy, the outcome, and features of FB. RESULTS: A total of 192 patients admitted for FB ingestion or aspiration in the pediatric surgery department were evaluated. The mean age was 40.97 (SD, 35.73) months. The majority of patients were younger than 4 years. Foreign bodies were mainly located in the upper esophagus for ingested FBs (60.8%), whereas for aspiration 43% of FBs were in the main right bronchus. A total of 4 patients died. The hospitalization period of patients admitted for FB aspiration was longer than that of patients with FB ingestion. Surgery was performed in 4 patients. The most commonly ingested FBs were coins, whereas seeds were the most commonly aspirated. CONCLUSION: Prevention is the key to dealing with FBIs. Because the frequency of foreign bodies is higher in underdeveloped countries, education of parents regarding the dangers and prevention of aspiration and ingestion is important.","2013-01","2025-04-14 13:41:11","2025-04-14 13:41:12","","53-57","","1","29","","Pediatr Emerg Care","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23283264","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23283264","","Humans; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Infant; Bronchoscopy; Foreign Bodies; Esophagoscopy; Statistics, Nonparametric; Child, Hospitalized; Turkey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The retrospective study includes patients in which urgent endoscopic investigations of the upper digestive tract were performed in a 23-year period, from 1st January 1994 to 1st January 2018. RESULTS: Altogether 13 196 patients were investigated: 5147 (39 %) females and 8049 (61 %) males, mean age 62.8 years, SD ± 18.5 years, range 1-106 years. In only 172 patients - 1.3 % of all subjects - true foreign bodies were detected (in range from 1-8) in the esophagus or stomach. In these patients, a total of 242 endoscopic procedures were performed. In 95.9 % the foreign bodies were removed endoscopically (165/172 patients); in 7 cases (4.1 %) the endoscopic procedures were not successful. Among the foreign bodies removed were various metal or plastic objects: hooks, batteries, coins, keys, screws, razor blades, lighters, buttons, toys, 3 toothbrushes as well as impacted safety pins. In patients with successful endoscopic removal, no significant complications were noted. In 12 patients (12/165, 7.2 %), hemorrhages from the region of the esophagogastric junction or stomach were observed; endoscopic hemostasis was performed in 10/12 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Urgent endoscopy has proved successful in removing true foreign bodies from the upper gastrointestinal tract in the analyzed period. Different factors affect the success of urgent intervention, the most important being adequate experience, skills, and patience of the endoscopic team.","2020-03","2025-04-14 13:45:11","2025-04-14 13:45:12","","217-223","","3","58","","Z Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32018317","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32018317","","Humans; Adult; Aged; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Young Adult; Esophagus; Child, Preschool; Infant; Foreign Bodies; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal; Upper Gastrointestinal Tract","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A diagnosis of small-bowel perforation, caused by a sharp or pointed foreign body, is rarely made preoperatively because the clinical symptoms are usually nonspecific and can mimic other surgical conditions, such as appendicitis and diverticulitis. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of a swallowed toothbrush which passed past the pylorus and perforated the terminal ileum. The patient however presented with a fluctuant mass in the left iliac fossa, pyrexia and generalised tenderness mimicking a diverticular abscess. DISCUSSION: Ingestion of a foreign body is commonly encountered in the clinic among children, adults with intellectual impairment, psychiatric illness or alcoholism, and dental prosthetic-wearing elderly subjects. However, toothbrush swallowing is rare, with only approximately 40 reported cases. CONCLUSION: Bowel perforation by foreign bodies can mimic acute appendicitis and should be considered in differential diagnoses. Clinically, patients often do not recall ingesting the foreign body, which makes the clinical diagnosis more challenging, and a correct diagnosis is frequently delayed. Several radiological investigations, such as small-bowel series, ultrasonography, and computed tomography scans, may lead to the correct diagnosis, but in most patients, the diagnosis is not confirmed until the surgical intervention has been performed.","2012","2025-04-14 13:50:57","2025-04-14 13:50:57","","184-185","","5","3","","Int J Surg Case Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 22406347 PMCID: PMC3316764","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/FWMZAXHX/Sewpaul et al. - 2012 - The case of the forgotten toothbrush.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406347","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Presentation of case A 29-year-old prisoner presented to the Emergency Department with vomiting, ten hours after he claimed to have swallowed a mobile phone. Clinical examination was unremarkable. Both initial and repeat abdominal radiographs eight hours later confirmed that the foreign body remained in situ in the stomach and had not progressed along the gastrointestinal tract. Based on these findings, upper endoscopy was performed under general anaesthesia. The object could not be aligned correctly to accommodate endoscopic removal using current retrieval devices. Following unsuccessful endoscopy, an upper midline laparotomy was performed and the phone was delivered through an anterior gastrotomy, away from the pylorus. The patient made an uneventful recovery and underwent psychological counselling prior to discharge. Discussion In this case report, the use of endoscopy in the management when a conservative approach fails is questioned. Can the current endoscopic retrieval devices be improved to limit the need for surgical interventions in future cases? Conclusion An ingested mobile phone in the stomach may not be amenable for removal using the current endoscopic retrieval devices. Improvements in overtubes or additional modifications of existing retrieval devices to ensure adequate alignment for removal without injuring the oesophagus are needed.","2016-01-01","2025-04-14 13:57:54","2025-04-14 13:57:54","2025-04-14 13:57:54","86-89","","","22","","International Journal of Surgery Case Reports","An ingested mobile phone in the stomach may not be amenable to safe endoscopic removal using current therapeutic devices","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/MS5CRJ2C/Obinwa et al. - 2016 - An ingested mobile phone in the stomach may not be.pdf; /Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/GNPEDL3Y/S2210261216300529.html","","","Stomach; Surgery; Case report; Endoscopic devices; Foreign body removal; Mobile phone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current literature is limited to case reports and fails to provide data regarding the management of sharp GFB ingestion. We hypothesized that patients who ingest sharp objects rarely have perforation or obstruction requiring surgical intervention.           METHODS            Patients presenting with GFBs from January 2005 to December 2015 at a level 1 trauma center with an acute care surgery program were retrospectively reviewed. Exclusion criteria were leaving without being seen, noningested GFB, unknown or blunt GFB, or if the GFB was not found on imaging. Data collected included patient demographics, length of stay, imaging, and interventions that were performed.           RESULTS            During the study period, there were 1,164 patients with 1,245 hospital visits for GFBs; 995 visits were excluded, resulting in 169 sharp GFB ingestion patients with 192 visits included in our study. The average age was 31. Sixty-five percent were men, and 41% were incarcerated. The average length of stay was 3 days, which was longer in patients with psychiatric holds and consultations. Of the 169 patients, 116 (69%) had no intervention and did not return for complications. Fifty-five endoscopies were performed with GFB removal in 30 cases. Seven patients (4%) underwent surgery, five of which had peritonitis. When evaluating the total study cohort, 134 (79%) of the patients had no procedure or a negative procedure. Patients requiring surgery had significantly larger objects (6 ± 3 cm) than those who had endoscopy (3 ± 2 cm) or no procedure (2 ± 1 cm).           CONCLUSION            Surgical intervention occurred in only seven (4%) patients with sharp GFB ingestions, and 79% of the patients required no intervention. Barring an acute abdomen or esophageal sharp GFBs, patients can be discharged with return precautions, admitted for necessary psychiatric care, or returned to custody for patients seeking secondary gain. Upper gastrointestinal larger GFBs should be removed endoscopically when possible.

Abdominal pain is the most common presenting symptom. We present a case of an ingested pen causing duodenal perforation and hepatic abscess several months after initially presenting with a pericardial effusion. Case presentation A 59-year-old female living in an intensive tertiary mental health facility was noted to have an incidental pericardial effusion during work-up for hyponatremia. Seven months later, she developed a new fever and was noted to have interval increase in the pericardial effusion size. This prompted further investigation which finally revealed that an ingested pen had perforated through the first part of the duodenum and caused an abscess in the left lobe of the liver. The pericardial effusion was presumed secondary to local inflammation. Upon discovery of the abscess, the patient underwent successful operative management including abscess drainage, foreign body extraction, and duodenal repair. Clinical discussion Reports of hepatic abscess from foreign body causing duodenal perforation are rare, with bone fragments and toothpicks the most common foreign bodies implicated. There is one other previously reported case of an ingested pen. Abdominal pain is present in up to 85% of cases, but fever may be the only presenting symptom. Conclusion Foreign body migration causing a hepatic abscess may present non-specifically with unexplained fever or even pericardial effusion. Psychiatric comorbidities may contribute to delays in diagnosis due to difficulties recalling the episode of ingestion.","2022-04-01","2025-04-14 14:09:48","2025-04-14 14:09:49","2025-04-14 14:09:48","106931","","","93","","International Journal of Surgery Case Reports","An unusual cause of pericardial effusion","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/Z9QPRICU/Yan et al. - 2022 - An unusual cause of pericardial effusion A case r.pdf; /Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/PFXT82UL/S2210261222001778.html","","","Case report; Foreign body, hepatic abscess, duodenal perforation; Pen; Unusual pericardial effusion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: From 1962 through 1998, 400 patients with EFB were treated in our department on an emergency basis. There were 202 men (50%) and 198 women (49.6%) ranging in age from 1.5 to 95 years. The main symptoms patients complained of were difficulty in swallowing and pain. Detailed anamnesis, oropharynx and hypopharynx examination and finally radiological examination were the diagnostic tools. The location of the FB was in the cervical esophagus in 57% of cases, in the thoracic one in 26% and at the cardioesophageal junction in 17%. The most common objects found were bones, morsels, coins and needles. RESULTS: The treatment consisted of rigid esophagoscopy under general anesthesia in 343 (85.7%) of our cases. In 57 cases (14.3%) other means such as flexible esophagoscopy, Fogarty or Foley catheters and bougienage turned to be very useful. Only 12 patients (3%) were led to surgery because either extraction was impossible or perforation was present. No major complications occurred in the surgical group, whereas in the group of rigid esophagoscopy, there was one iatrogenous esophageal perforation that presented with empyema thoracis successfully treated. Finally, there was a case of an aortoesophageal fistula with mortal outcome perioperatively. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Esophagoscopy is a reliable method in the treatment of EFB impaction. (2) Alternative methods such as bougienage, etc., can be used only in selected cases with smooth foreign bodies. (3) Surgical treatment is unavoidable in cases of irretrievable EFB or esophageal perforation.","2002-04","2025-04-14 14:14:17","2025-04-14 14:14:19","","653-656","","4","21","","Eur J Cardiothorac Surg","Management of esophageal foreign bodies","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 11932163","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/UXMA5GNU/Athanassiadi et al. - 2002 - Management of esophageal foreign bodies a retrosp.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11932163","","Humans; Length of Stay; Adult; Aged; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Aged, 80 and over; Treatment Outcome; Child; Thoracotomy; Esophagus; Child, Preschool; Infant; Follow-Up Studies; Reoperation; Foreign Bodies; Esophagoscopy; Greece; Survival Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However foreign-body lodged in the ileocecal region is very rare. This study aims to report the exceptional case of a patient with a foreign body lodged in the ileocecal region revealed by sub-occlusive syndromes. The study involved a patient aged 22 years with no particular past medical history, presenting with König's syndrome evolving in a context of alteration of the general state. Anatomopathological examination of surgical ileocecal specimen performed after inconclusive endoscopy, histologic examination of the biopsies and scannography, showed ileocecal thickening due to infammatory response to a foreign body. In the absence of anamnestic data, ileocecal foreign body poses a real problem of differential diagnosis including inflammatory, infectious and tumoral diseases of the ileocecal junction. The presence of a foreign body may be revealed by occlusive complications or perforations, hence the essential role of imaging. Endoscopy always plays a central diagnostic and therapeutic role in the management of ingested foreign bodies, thus reducing surgical morbidity (although it is sometimes unavoidable). Anatomopathological study shows foreign body granuloma. Cases of foreign body lodged in the ileocecal region have been rarely reported. Now they should be suspected in patients with any symptom, including ileocecal junction disorders, in order to avoid side effects and complications due to heavy treatments.","2018","2025-04-14 14:15:50","2025-04-14 14:15:50","","236","","","31","","Pan Afr Med J","[An ileo-caecal foreign body mimicking a Crohn disease","","","","","","","fre","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31447993 PMCID: PMC6691309","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/43RIQLSX/Montacer et al. - 2018 - [An ileo-caecal foreign body mimicking a Crohn dis.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447993","","Humans; Male; Diagnosis, Differential; Young Adult; Endoscopy; Ileum; Cecum; Crohn Disease; foreign body granuloma; Granuloma, Foreign-Body; ileo-caecal resection; ileo-caecal thickening; Koening syndrome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The possibility of penetration of the intestinal tract, by sharp, pointed objects, however, necessitates careful and continued observation. If such objects become lodged in a narrow segment of the gastrointestinal tract, perforation may occur. The resulting morbidity depends on the further route of the penetrating object and whether septic sequelae ensue. Although foreign bodies may migrate to almost any intraabdominal organ, perforation of the duodenum and migration into the liver are extremely rare. A case of a woman who unknowingly ingested a pin that perforated the duodenum causing only few acute symptoms is presented. Biliary tract pathology was suspected, but ultrasound examination ruled it out. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed a pin thrust into the liver, with the head of the pin in the wall of the duodenum. Traditional surgical treatment requires laparotomy for foreign body removal. In the reported case, the pin was removed laparoscopically. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient left the hospital on day 2 after the procedure. With laparoscopic approach for removal of penetrating intestinal foreign bodies, laparotomy and its attending complications are avoided. This approach is less invasive, has a beneficial impact on postoperative pain, produces a better cosmetic result, and offers a faster return to normal activities. Hospital stay and costs also are reduced.","2002-03","2025-04-14 14:18:04","2025-04-14 14:18:08","","537","","3","16","","Surg Endosc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 11928045","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11928045","","Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Laparoscopy; Radiography; Foreign Bodies; Duodenum; Foreign-Body Migration; Liver","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We had reviewed 1,428 patients with esophageal foreign body, who were hospitalized and treated over the past 25 years. A classification summary was made of 121 patients (of these 1,428 cases) who presented with esophageal foreign body-induced perforation and complicated cervical abscess, mediastinitis, and mediastinal abscess. This summary considered foreign body types, location and lodging duration, complications, and surgical approaches. Among these 121 patients, esophageal foreign bodies in 81 patients were successfully extracted via esophagoscope or fiber optic esophagoscope. Cervical esophageal foreign bodies in 22 patients were extracted by esophagoscope and lateral cervical incision (n = 6) and simple lateral cervical incision (n = 16). Thoracotomy was performed to remove thoracic esophageal foreign bodies in 18 patients with 10 successes and 8 failures. Of the 121 patients, 67 patients with cervical abscess were cured by means of lateral cervical abscess incision and drainage, esophageal stent placement, and esophageal perforation repair with pedicle myolemma or pedicle muscular periosteum flap. 54 patients with mediastinitis and/or abscess were all cured, except one mortality, by means of mediastinotomy and drainage or/and closed-chest drainage, simple esophageal repair, esophageal repair with pedicle myolemma or pedicle muscular periosteum flap and stent placement for esophageal perforation, and esophageal exclusion plus two-stage gastric-pharyngeal anastomosis. In the treatment of esophageal foreign body-induced severe complications, various therapies should be applied simultaneously. Lateral cervical incision should be made immediately to remove the foreign bodies if the foreign body extraction under esophagoscope proves to be a failure after repeated attempts, or esophageal perforation develops during the procedure, or should cervical abscess develop. Mediastinotomy and drainage or/and closed-chest drainage should be carried out as early as possible when mediastinitis and/or mediastinal abscess develops after esophageal foreign body ingestion.","2012-09-01","2025-04-14 14:25:07","2025-04-14 14:25:08","2025-04-14 14:25:07","2027-2036","","9","269","","Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/FHQCA2IN/Peng et al. - 2012 - Study of clinical treatment of esophageal foreign .pdf","","","Surgery; Foreign bodies; Mediastinal abscess; Cervical abscess; Esophageal perforation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We describe our experience in treating these lesions surgically. METHOD: From 1995 to 2006, data were collected prospectively in 33 patients (18 women and 15 men; mean age 64 years) operated on for intestinal perforation due to an ingested FB. The type of object, preoperative diagnosis, perforation site, treatment, morbidity and mortality were reviewed. RESULTS: Foreign body ingestion was predominantly involuntary (88%). The mean time from ingestion to perforation was 10.4 days. The most frequently ingested objects were dietary FB (n = 21) and toothpicks (n = 6). The most frequent predisposing factors were dentures or an orthodontic appliance (73%). The most common preoperative diagnoses were acute abdomen of uncertain origin (n = 7), acute appendicitis (n = 7) and acute diverticulitis (n = 5). Pneumoperitoneum was observed in 10 cases. The diagnosis was reached during laparotomy in 30 (91%) cases. The most frequent perforation site was the colorectal region (n = 18, 54.5%), followed by the terminal ileum (n = 7, 21.2%); intraperitoneal perforation was the most common (n = 30, 91%). All cases had abdominal contamination and 22 (66.7%) had diffuse peritonitis. Treatment was always by surgery and antibiotics. Thirteen patients required a colostomy. Morbidity was 57.6% (n = 19) and mortality 6.1% (n = 2). CONCLUSION: Intestinal perforation by a foreign body is rare and normally affects the sigmoid colon, rectum or distal ileum. Dentures are a common risk factor. Patients are rarely aware of foreign body ingestion. Dietary FB and toothpicks are the most commonly ingested objects. Treatment consists of surgery and antibiotics. Appendicitis and acute diverticulitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis.","2008-09","2025-04-14 14:31:09","2025-04-14 14:31:11","","701-707","","7","10","","Colorectal Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 18005196","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18005196","","Humans; Adult; Aged; Prospective Studies; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Cohort Studies; Aged, 80 and over; Risk Factors; Young Adult; Digestive System Surgical Procedures; Intestinal Perforation; Foreign-Body Migration; Abdominal Pain; Intestinal Obstruction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this report, we present a rare case of razor blades lodged in the appendix as a result of intentional ingestion. Presentation of case A 25 year old male prisoner presented to our hospital with persistent right iliac fossa pain after razor blade ingestion. After 5 days of conservative management, there was no sign of transition on serial X-Rays. Laparoscopy with intraoperative image intensification confirmed the presence of the razor blades in the appendix and appendicectomy was subsequently performed without complications. Discussion Most ingested objected with diameter less than 2.5 cm and length less than 6 cm can pass through the gastrointestinal tract spontaneously in less than one week. The entry of foreign objects into the appendix is thought to be due to relative low motility of the caecum, the dependent position of the appendix and the size of the appendiceal orifice. Radiographic localisation to the appendiceal lumen was complicated by metallic artefact, but was consistent with failure to transit. Appendicectomy was felt to be the safest mode of retrieval. Conclusion Ingested foreign body lodged in the appendix is a rare event. Once the exact location is confirmed, a simple laparoscopic appendicectomy can be performed to facilitate the removal.","2018-01-01","2025-04-14 14:34:52","2025-04-14 14:34:52","2025-04-14 14:34:52","29-32","","","45","","International Journal of Surgery Case Reports","Ingested razor blades within the appendix","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/47T66669/Cui et al. - 2018 - Ingested razor blades within the appendix A rare .pdf; /Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/6KCXN4ID/S2210261218300981.html","","","Laparoscopy; Case report; Foreign body ingestion; Appendicectomy; Appendicitis; Razor blades","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Removal of FBs is not an infrequent challenge for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The aim of this study is to elicit our experience in a 5-year period in dealing with FBs in the upper gastrointestinal tract using upper endoscopy. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at Zagazig University Hospitals, Egypt, over a 5-year period. We reviewed all patients' files with full notations on age, sex, type of FB and its anatomical location, treatments, and outcomes (complications, success rates, and mortalities). Patients with incomplete files and those with FBs not identified at the endoscopic examination were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients were identified. Their ages ranged from 6 months to 102 years. Slight male predominance was noticed (53.3%). The most frequent presentation was a history of FB ingestion without any associated manifestations (44.4%). Coins were the most commonly encountered FBs (14/45). Esophagus was the most common site of trapping (27/45). The overall success rate was 95.6% (43/45). Upper endoscopy successfully resolved the problem by either FB removal (41/43) or dislodgment of the impacted fleshy meat to the stomach (2/43). Two cases were referred for surgical removal. The rate of complications was 6.7%. Furthermore, no mortalities due to FB ingestion or removal had been reported throughout the study. CONCLUSION: Our experience with FB removal emphasizes its importance and ease when performed by experienced hands, at well-equipped endoscopy units, and under conscious sedation in most cases, with high success rates and minor complications.","2014","2025-04-14 14:37:53","2025-04-14 14:37:55","","249-253","","","7","","Clin Exp Gastroenterol","Endoscopic removal of foreign bodies from the upper gastrointestinal tract","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25053889 PMCID: PMC4105424","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/FZI94VZH/Emara et al. - 2014 - Endoscopic removal of foreign bodies from the uppe.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25053889","","forceps; coins; fleshy meat; postsclerotherapy esophageal stricture; upper endoscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Distinct foreign bodies predispose to particular locations of impaction in the gastrointestinal tract, commonly meat boluses in the esophagus above a preexisting esophageal stricture or ring in adults and coins in children. Several other groups are at high risk of foreign body impaction, mentally handicapped individuals or those with psychiatric illness, abusers of drugs or alcohol, and the geriatric population. Patients with foreign body ingestion typically present with odynophagia, dysphagia, sensation of having an object stuck, chest pain, and nausea/vomiting. The majority of foreign bodies pass through the digestive system spontaneously without causing any harm, symptoms, or necessitating any further intervention. A well-documented clinical history and thorough physical exam is critical in making the diagnosis, if additional modalities are needed, a CT scan and diagnostic endoscopy are generally the preferred modalities. Various tools can be used to remove foreign bodies, and endoscopic treatment is safe and effective if performed by a skilled endoscopist.","2016","2025-04-14 14:39:51","2025-04-14 14:39:53","","8520767","","","2016","","Gastroenterol Res Pract","Endoscopic Management of Foreign Bodies in the Gastrointestinal Tract","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27807447 PMCID: PMC5078654","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/EENXHZ8Y/Bekkerman et al. - 2016 - Endoscopic Management of Foreign Bodies in the Gas.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27807447","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Commercial availability of rare-earth magnets poses a serious health risk. This study defines incidence, characteristics, and management of ingestions over time. METHODS: Cases were identified by searching radiology reports from June 2002 to December 2012 at a children's hospital and verified by chart and imaging review. Relative risk (RR) regressions determined changes in incidence and interventions over time. RESULTS: In all, 98% of ingestions occurred since 2006; 57% involved multiple magnets. Median age was 8 years (range 0 to 18); 0% of single and 56% of multiple ingestions required intervention. Compared with 2007 to 2009, ingestions increased from 2010 to 2012 (RR = 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.0). Intervention proportion was unchanged (RR = .94, 95% confidence interval .4 to 2.2). Small spherical magnets comprised 26.8% of ingestions since 2010; 86% involved multiple magnets and 47% required intervention.

Like other repetitive and ritualistic behaviours, pica may be postulated to fall at times on this spectrum. METHODS: Five cases of pica seen at our clinics are presented here in order to test this hypothesis. Phenomenology, neurobiology (where available) and pharmacotherapy data are provided in order to consider a possible relationship with OCD and OCD spectrum disorders. RESULTS: In 2 of the cases, pica appeared to be a compulsion and patients had additional symptoms which met diagnostic criteria for OCD. In 2 of the cases, the clinical picture and neurobiological data were reminiscent of an impulse control disorder. Four of the 5 patients responded to treatment with a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SRI). CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with a hypothesis that at least some cases of pica may usefully be conceptualised as lying within a compulsive-impulsive spectrum of symptoms and disorders.","1996-12","2025-04-14 15:47:04","2025-04-14 15:47:04","","1586-1588, 1591-1592","","12 Suppl","86","","S Afr Med J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 9180801","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9180801","","Humans; Adult; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Child; Antidepressive Agents; Clomipramine; Pica; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder; 1-Naphthylamine; Citalopram; Sertraline; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accidental ingestion of the foreign body is by far the most common. Deliberate ingestion may result from an act of insanity, a dare, a habit or medicinal therapy. Retention of elongated or pointed objects in the duodenum is a frequent problem. Long, sharp, objects may perforate the duodenum and have been known to migrate widely in the abdomen. Early removal of such objects has been advised. This case forms rarity due to the fact that the 7 inches knife remained in the Duodenum for 07 long years without causing major catastrophe.

Foreign bodies are a rare cause of appendicitis. We tried to define potentially dangerous foreign bodies that may cause appendicitis and summarize general guidelines for their clinical management. Methods: A 100-year literature review including 256 cases of ingested foreign bodies within the appendix with emphasis on: (1) objects that are more prone to cause appendicitis or appendiceal perforation; (2) foreign bodies that are radiopaque and may be detected during follow-up with plain abdominal films, and (3) guidelines for clinical management. Results: Complications usually occur with sharp, thin, stiff, pointed and long objects. The majority of these objects are radiopaque. An immediate attempt should be made to remove a risky object by gastroscopy. If this fails, clinical follow-up with serial abdominal radiographs should be obtained. If the anatomical position of the object appears not to change and, most commonly, remains in the right lower abdominal quadrant, an attempt at colonoscopic removal is indicated. If this is unsuccessful, laparoscopic exploration with fluoroscopic guidance should be carried out to localize and remove the objects either by ileotomy, colotomy, or by appendectomy. Conclusion: Foreign bodies causing appendicitis are rare. However, if stiff or pointed objects get into the appendiceal lumen they have a high risk for appendicitis or perforation. These foreign bodies are almost always radiopaque.","1999-01-25","2025-04-14 16:06:32","2025-04-14 16:06:34","2025-04-14 16:06:32","308-314","","5","16","","Digestive Diseases","Ingested Foreign Bodies within the Appendix","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/2X3UFHB2/Ingested-Foreign-Bodies-within-the-Appendix-A-100.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract uneventfully, and perforation is rare. The aim of this study was to report our experience with ingested FB perforations of the GI tract treated surgically at our institution. Methods A total of 62 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for an ingested FB perforation of the GI tract between 1990 and 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. Three patients with no definite FB demonstrated intraoperatively were included. Results The patients had a median age of 58 years, and 37 (60%) were male. Of the 59 FBs recovered, 55 (93%) were toothpicks and dietary FBs such as fish bones or bone fragments. A definitive preoperative history of FB ingestion was obtained for only two patients, and 36 of 52 patients (69%) wore dentures. Altogether, 18 (29%) perforations occurred in the anus or distal rectum, and 44 perforations were intraabdominal, with the most common abdominal site being the distal ileum (39%). Patients with FB perforations in the stomach, duodenum, and large intestine were significantly more likely to be afebrile (P = 0.043), to have chronic symptoms (> 3 days) (P < 0.001), to have a normal total white blood cell count (P < 0.001), and to be asymptomatic or present with an abdominal mass or abscess (P < 0.001) compared to those with FB perforations in the jejunum and ileum. Conclusions Ingested FB perforation in the adult population is most commonly secondary to unconscious accidental ingestion and is frequently caused by dietary FBs especially fish bones. A preoperative history of FB ingestion is thus rarely obtained, although wearing dentures is a common risk factor. FB perforations of the stomach, duodenum, and large intestine tend to present with a longer, more innocuous clinical picture than perforations in the jejunum or ileum.","2006","2025-04-14 16:11:57","2025-04-14 16:11:59","2025-04-14 16:11:57","1658","","3","30","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2006 The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Société Internationale de Chirurgie","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1007/s00268-005-0490-2","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/JEC4A8N5/s00268-005-0490-2.html","","","Foreign Body; Fish Bone; Perianal Abscess; Plain Radiography; Prison Inmate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They can migrate through the esophageal wall, damaging the nearby organs such as the aorta or the trachea, with fatal outcome. After the diagnosis, the viable treatments for extracting the foreign body and repairing the perforation are several. The appropriate treatment, may be endoscopic, surgical or combined, depending on the level of the perforation, on the co-morbidities of the patient and on the available resources. Presentation of case This paper describes a case of a 68 years old patient with a double EP caused by a meat-bone that perforated the thoracic esophageal wall, approaching the aorta on the left side and the azygos vein on the right side. Discussion Because of the double transfixion and the position near the aorta and the azygos, it was not possible to remove safely the bone during the endoscopy. The management required a combined endoscopic and surgical approach. This way it was possible to detect easily the location of the perforation, to remove safely the foreign body, to repair the perforation both from the outside and from the inside, and to place the nasogastric tube under direct vision. Conclusion Even when the type of esophageal perforation requires surgical treatment, the simultaneous use of endoscopy proved to be an advantage in order to extract the foreign body safely, to perform a double repair of the perforation and to place the nasogastric tube under direct vision.","2015-01-01","2025-04-14 16:12:11","2025-04-14 16:12:11","2025-04-14 16:12:11","55-57","","","17","","International Journal of Surgery Case Reports","Double esophageal perforation by ingested foreign body","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/D4LBREHJ/Ugenti et al. - 2015 - Double esophageal perforation by ingested foreign .pdf; /Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/8ELTQ9UP/S2210261215004708.html","","","Foreign body; Esophageal perforation; Endoscopic treatment; Surgical treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, reasons for bezoar formation, measures to be taken and treatment modalities were investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The files of the patients who were found to have gastro-intestinal bezoars and who were treated at Istanbul University, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty General Surgery Department and Emergency Unit between the years 1970 and 2005 were analysed. RESULTS: Thirteen (30%) of the 44 patients in the study were women, 31 (70%) were men: the mean age was 55.5 +/- 19.6 (range 22-96) years. Enzymatic dissolution (3 patients) and endoscopic fragmentation (four patients) were unsuccessful. Laparoscopic gastrotomy (n = 2), gastrotomy (n = 16), gastric resection (n = 3), enterotomy (n = 12), segmental intestinal resection (n = 3), gastroduodenotomy (n = 1), and gastrotomy + enterotomy (n = 3) were performed. In two patients, bezoars were fragmented and milked to caecum. There were no major postoperative complications, except abdominal wound infection in 4 patients and one patient who had a recurrent intestinal bezoar five years after the operation. One of the patients died because of heart failure on the 7th postoperative day. Mean hospital stay was 9.5 +/- 3.6 days. CONCLUSION: Even though rarely seen in digestive tract diseases, the probability of BZ formation should always be remembered. After the removal of BZs by conservative methods or surgery, precautions should be taken against recurrence and possible underlying psychiatric disorders should be treated.","2009","2025-04-14 16:15:14","2025-04-14 16:15:14","","198-203","","2","109","","Acta Chir Belg","Gastro-intestinal bezoars","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 19499681","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19499681","","Humans; Adult; Aged; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Cohort Studies; Aged, 80 and over; Young Adult; Gastrointestinal Tract; Endoscopy; Laparotomy; Digestive System Surgical Procedures; Bezoars; Solvents","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study is, therefore, one of a few that explores the phenomenon of NSSI among males who engage in this behavior in a correctional setting. The purpose of this article is to present the demographic and motivational factors of adult males who engage in NSSI in a correctional setting. The sample consisted of 42 adult males incarcerated in three New Mexico Prisons who had a history of NSSI. Of the participants, 40% were Hispanic and 60% were non-Hispanic. Three measures were used in this study: the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI), the Self-Injury Motivational Scale-II (SIMS-II), and a researcher-created demographic questionnaire. The DSHI was used to examine the types of self-harm, as well as the frequency, severity, and duration of each behavior. The SIMS-II explored 36 potential types of motivations or reasons for self-injurious behavior. Fifteen of the 16 forms of NSSI were endorsed by at least one of the participants. The most predominant type of NSSI reported was cutting (93%), followed by head banging (78%), and sticking oneself with sharp objects (71.4%). Ninety-three percent of the participants required medical attention or hospitalization due to NSSI behaviors. Motivational factors associated with cutting were predominantly mood dysregulation, communication, and addictive qualities.","2014-08","2025-04-14 16:23:37","2025-04-14 16:23:37","","628-634","","8","35","","Issues Ment Health Nurs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25072216","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25072216","","Humans; Adult; Male; Middle Aged; Sex Factors; Prisoners; Prisons; Self-Injurious Behavior; Motivation; Cross-Sectional Studies; New Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Colonoscopic retrieval was unsuccessful. A subsequent laparotomy revealed a chronically inflamed thickened terminal ileum with mesenteric fat encroachment necessitating a right hemicolectomy. Histopathological analysis confirmed Crohn's disease with impaction of the 20-pence coin in a distal terminal ileum stricture near the ileo-caecal valve. LEARNING POINT: Gastrointestinal foreign body retention should alert the clinician to the presence of an undiagnosed bowel abnormality. Furthermore, failed endoscopic retrieval should be considered as a marker for potential underlying gastrointestinal pathology and a requirement for operative intervention.

We examined the characteristics and outcomes of patients who required surgical intervention. STUDY DESIGN: Charts of all patients who underwent surgery at our institution for ingested drug packets between January 1990 and January 2005 were reviewed. Patients were identified by a pre-existing list of names collected prospectively and by admission codes. Reviewed parameters included presentation, method of diagnosis, indication for surgery, procedure, and patient outcome. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were identified, for whom charts were available for review. Main indications for surgery were drug toxicity and small bowel obstruction. Most packets were retrieved using a combination of milking and multiple enterotomies. A high rate (40%) of postoperative wound infection was found. The incidence of wound infection correlated significantly with the number of enterotomies. CONCLUSION: Surgical intervention for body packing remains the treatment for a minority of these patients. Patients should be placed in lithotomy to facilitate the exposure of the entire gastrointestinal tract, and to allow milking of the packets and their possible retrieval through the anus. The number of enterotomies should be minimized in order to reduce the risk of wound infection. If multiple enterotomies are used, the surgeon should consider leaving the wound open for delayed closure.","2006-04","2025-04-14 16:33:42","2025-04-14 16:33:44","","541-546","","4","30","","World J Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 16568225","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16568225","","Humans; Length of Stay; Adult; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Cocaine; Postoperative Complications; Reoperation; Foreign Bodies; Deglutition; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Cross-Sectional Studies; Foreign-Body Migration; Gastrostomy; Intestinal Obstruction; Enterostomy; Heroin; Illicit Drugs; New York; Surgical Wound Infection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, certain objects, such as intentionally concealed drug packets, may go undetected unless a high degree of suspicion exists and appropriate window settings are used to review the study.

The foreign bodies included a penknife, an aerosol deodorant spray can, a blue plastic tumbler, a plastic bag containing two bank-notes and some marijuana, a plastic packet containing fish hooks, a penlight torch, a broomstick, a battery powered vibrator, a primus stove, a cap of an aerosol can, a piece of wire, a piece of hosepipe wrapped with wire and an iron bar. They entered the alimentary tract for a variety of reasons; anal autoeroticism (3), concealment (2), attention seeking behaviour (3), accidental (1), assault (2) and to alleviate constipation (2). Plain radiographs accurately demonstrated the site of the foreign body in 8 patients. Extraction was at laparotomy in 2 patients with peritonitis and in 3 who required extraction by colotomy. In 7 patients who had transanal extraction, four required general anaesthesia to facilitate extraction and extraction was possible under conscious sedation in the emergency room in three. The remaining patient extracted the foreign body himself and presented to hospital with a rectal perforation. CONCLUSION: The emergency room physician must confirm the presence of a rectal foreign body. Extraction in the emergency room is usually not possible and patient's with retained rectal foreign bodies should be referred to a colorectal surgeon.","2005-01","2025-04-14 16:45:39","2025-04-14 16:45:39","","98-103","","1","7","","Colorectal Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 15606596","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15606596","","Humans; Adult; Aged; Retrospective Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Algorithms; Child, Preschool; Foreign Bodies; Decision Trees; Colon; Photography; Rectum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recent fashion of body piercing among adults has encouraged children to have similar procedures or imitate them by applying small magnets to sustain the jewellery used in piercing in position. This paper describes a series of 24 cases presented to the Sheffield Children's Hospital over a period of eight weeks. The children imitated body piercing by using small powerful magnets across parts of their body including nose, ears, penis, and tongue. Some swallowed the magnets while attempting to use them, resulting in one near fatal surgical complication.

A 6-year-old boy was referred to our institution with a 12 h history of abdominal pain. This pain was diffuse and crampy in nature and associated with multiple episodes of non-bilious, non-bloody emesis. On evaluation he was stable and his abdomen demonstrated slight distention and tenderness without peritoneal signs. Plain abdominal radiographs demonstrated some distended loops of small bowel and a radio-opaque foreign object within the mid-abdomen. A small bowel obstruction secondary to foreign body ingestion was diagnosed and an emergent laparotomy performed. Upon exploration, a transition zone was noted near the ileocecal valve. Further exploration revealed the obstruction to be caused secondary to the apposition of two small (8 mm) magnets, one in the proximal ileum and the other near the ileocecal valve, resulting in an internal hernia. The magnets were easily separated relieving the obstruction and both were removed via two small bowel enterotomies. After being presented with the magnets, his parents suspected that they came from the clothes of a Polly Pocket (Mattel, Inc., El Segundo, CA) doll. The patient had an uneventful post-operative course and was discharged to home on the second post-operative day. This case demonstrates the complications that may occur with multiple magnet ingestion. It highlights the need for close observation and early surgical intervention in children with a suspected history of foreign body ingestion, a clinical picture of gastrointestinal distress, and radiographic evidence of a radio-opaque foreign object.","2007-12","2025-04-14 16:55:27","2025-04-14 16:55:27","","1245-1247","","12","23","","Pediatr Surg Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 17694401","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17694401","","Humans; Male; Child; Diagnosis, Differential; Follow-Up Studies; Foreign Bodies; Laparotomy; Radiography, Abdominal; Magnetics; Intestine, Small; Intestinal Obstruction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Trauma was accidental in one and due to suicidal attempts in the other two. The objects were removed. There are 157 published accounts of wounding of the heart and/or great vessels by pins and needles. The victims have ranged from infants to the elderly. Causative agencies were accidents, suicide, and homicide. A few were discovered at necropsy in presumably asymptomatic persons. Six of the accidental injuries were iatrogenic. The objects reached the heart or great vessels from transthoracic insertion, ingestion, embolization, aspiration, or transabdominal penetration. The overall mortality incidence was about 50%. Acute cardiac tamponade was the dominant cause of death. Almost all individuals survived who were operated upon and from whom the object was removed. The right ventricle was hurt most often, but no region of the heart or of the great vessels was spared. Occasionally multiple parts were affected. The primary damage occurred principally while the foreign body was extracardiac and relatively immobilized, from repetitive scratching or puncturing of the beating heart. Chest pain and unfolding patterns of tamponade were inconsistent in onset, severity, and duration. Death ensuing days or weeks after the initial injury was frequent. Progressive haemopericardium in some cases was due to or aggravated by laceration of a structure from within outward. Late complications—several fatal—were consequent upon inflammation, sepsis or thromboembolism. It is urged that all foreign bodies in the heart or great vessels be retrieved, even if seemingly innocuous clinically.","1969-03","2025-04-14 17:03:04","2025-04-14 17:03:04","","246-253","","2","24","","Thorax","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 5821627 PMCID: PMC471946","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/EUKEMIY4/Schechter and Gilbert - 1969 - Injuries of the heart and great vessels due to pin.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5821627","","Humans; Adult; Aged; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Aorta; Adolescent; Dyspnea; Radiography; Foreign Bodies; Heart Injuries; Cardiac Tamponade; Venae Cavae","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Few papers in the literature report experience and outcome at tertiary centers. The aim of this paper is to report the management and the outcomes in 414 patients admitted for suspected ingestion of foreign body between May 1995 and December 1999. METHODS: A plain radiographic film of the neck, chest or abdomen was obtained in the case of radiopaque objects, and in order to rule out suspected perforation: in such cases a computed tomography (CT) study was also performed. All patients were asked to give their informed consent, which was refused by three patients. Anesthesia was always used, either conscious sedation (86.8 %), or general anesthesia in the case of poor patient tolerance (13.2 %). All patients underwent an endoscopic procedure within six hours of admission. A flexible scope was used in all patients and a wide range of endoscopic devices was employed. RESULTS: Foreign bodies were found in 64.5 % of our patients. Almost all were found in the esophagus. The types of foreign body were very different, but they were chiefly food boluses, bones or cartilages, dental prostheses or fish bones. In three patients (1.1 %) it was impossible to endoscopically remove the foreign body, which was located in the cervical esophagus: all these three patients required surgery. No complications relating to the endoscopic procedure were observed, but 30.7 % of patients had an underlying esophageal disease, such as a stricture. Only eight patients required a second endoscopic procedure, performed by a more experienced endoscopist. CONCLUSION: Foreign body ingestion represents a frequent reason for emergency endoscopy. The endoscopic procedure is a successful technique which allows the removal of the foreign bodies in almost all cases without significant complications. Surgery is rarely required.","2001-08","2025-04-14 17:08:19","2025-04-14 17:08:19","","692-696","","8","33","","Endoscopy","Endoscopic management of foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal tract","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 11490386","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11490386","","Humans; Adult; Aged; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Risk Factors; Foreign Bodies; Digestive System; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal; Emergency Treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted on all patients (527) who were admitted with esophageal FB during a period of 9 years from January 1992 to January 2000. Two major referral hospitals were involved: the Princess Basma and Al-Bashir hospitals. A data sheet was constructed in which we included: name, age, gender, presenting symptoms, type and site of FB, technique of removal, and complications if present. RESULTS: Of the 527 patients 53% were male and 47% were female.77% were children under the age of 10 years. In children coins were by far the most common FB to be found in the esophagus (68%), while bones were the principal FB to be found in adults (8%). In 89%, the FB was found at the level of cricopharyngeal muscle. Drooling of saliva (72%), dysphagia (71%), and vomiting (24%) were the most commonly presenting symptoms. Both rigid esophagoscopy and Magill forceps techniques were used to remove the FB from the esophagus. The complication rate was 2% which included: esophageal perforation and mediastinitis, esophageal stenosis and esophageal erosions. CONCLUSION: The pattern of esophageal FB in Jordan is not different from other countries.","2002-07-09","2025-04-14 17:08:41","2025-04-14 17:08:41","","225-227","","3","64","","Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol","Esophageal foreign bodies","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 12090950","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12090950","","Humans; Adult; Aged; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Esophagus; Child, Preschool; Infant; Deglutition Disorders; Foreign Bodies; Esophagoscopy; Airway Obstruction; Jordan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The types of foreign bodies ingested included metal objects such as pins and wires; bony objects such as chicken or fish bones; wooden splinters; and other bizarre pointed bodies.2.2. Seventy-three per cent of the perforations occurred in and around the ileocecal region, the remainder being distributed generally from the stomach to the rectum.3.3. Six cases of perforation of the intestine with a hernial sac were reported.4.4. Duration of symptoms ranged from a few hours to two weeks in 50 per cent of the cases.

The phenomenology of this behavior, as well as its psychiatric and medical complications are discussed. It is probable that chronic nicotinism contributed to this patient's refractoriness to psychiatric treatment and to his eventual cardiovascular crisis. The occurrence of pica as a manifestation of severe psychopathology was vividly described by the early pioneers of neuropsychiatry, but has received little attention in recent psychiatric literature. This is in marked contrast to the syndrome of psychogenic water intoxication which continues to be reported frequently. The majority of descriptions of pica have dealt with its occurrence in children, in pregnant women, and as a societal practice in certain cultures studied from a medico-anthropologic point of view. The toxic organic brain syndrome caused by chronic ingestion of nicotine-containing products has also been neglected in psychiatric publications. Descriptions of the neuropsychiatric complications of subacute and chronic nicotinism have been restricted to textbooks of toxicology, where greater emphasis has been given to the acute effects of large quantities of nicotine, often in forms other than tobacco. The following case illustrates the near-fatal practice of tobacco pica in a psychotic patient and dramatically demonstrates the systemic and central nervous system effects of nicotinism.","1977-09","2025-04-14 17:19:21","2025-04-14 17:19:21","","724-726","","9","38","","Dis Nerv Syst","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 902560","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/902560","","Humans; Adult; Male; Myocardial Infarction; Schizophrenia; Pica; Nicotine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of 78 foreign bodies, 67 (86%) passed the gastrointestinal tract spontaneously without complications, 9 (11%) were removed endoscopically, and only 2 (3%) required surgery. There were no gastrointestinal perforations. Even foreign bodies with a maximal length of 13.5 cm appeared in the feces spontaneously within a few days.

In adults, foreign bodies are usually ingested accidentally together with food. This happens more commonly in persons with certain pathological changes of the gastrointestinal tract. Methods: We present a selective review of pertinent literature retrieved by a search in the PubMed database. Results: The foreign bodies most commonly ingested by adults are fish bones and chicken bones. The clinical approach to the problem depends on the type of material ingested and on the patient’s symptoms and physical findings. In about 80% of cases, the ingested material passes uneventfully through the gastrointestinal tract; endoscopy is performed in about 20% of cases, and surgery in less than 1%. Emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is recommended when the esophagus is completely occluded (because of the risk of aspiration and/or pressure necrosis), when the ingested object has a sharp point or edge (because of the risk of perforation, with ensuing mediastinitis or peritonitis), and when a battery has been ingested (because of the risk of necrosis and fistula formation). For non-occluding esophageal foreign bodies, including magnets, an urgent but non-emergency EGD within 12 to 24 hours is recommended.
