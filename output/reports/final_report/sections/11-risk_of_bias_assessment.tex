\subsection*{Risk of Bias Assessment}

Risk of bias was assessed manually for all included studies by a single reviewer (JGE), using the \textit{Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklists for Case Reports and Case Series}~\cite{Moola_2020}. Studies were first classified as either case reports or case series based on the level of granularity in the data. Each study was then evaluated using the corresponding JBI tool.

In addition to manual JBI appraisal, a logic-based validation filter was applied to all case reports using \textit{Python Pandas}~\cite{ThePandasDevelopmentTeam_2020}. This secondary filter assessed whether key variables --- specifically, outcomes, object characteristics, and motivation --- were completely unreported. This two-stage process --- comprising manual critical appraisal followed by automated validation --- ensured both transparency and reproducibility in the assessment of study quality.
