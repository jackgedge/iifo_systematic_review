\subsection*{Objectives}
This systematic review aims to quantify the rates of endoscopic and surgical interventions following intentional ingestion of foreign objects in human populations. It also seeks to examine how individual factors—such as demographic characteristics and motivations for ingestion (including protest, self-harm, or suicidal intent)—influence the likelihood of requiring invasive intervention. Finally, the review assesses how the type of object ingested is associated with clinical outcomes, including the need for endoscopic or surgical procedures and the incidence of complications.
