\section{Introduction}

This preliminary data extraction report is based on the first 30 results from a systematic review investigating whether motivation influences rates of endoscopy, surgery, and complications in individuals who have intentionally ingested a foreign object.

The aims of this report are to assess whether the current data extraction spreadsheet is fit for purpose—specifically, whether the variables are effectively capturing relevant data and whether any key information is being missed—and to explore early correlations between variables using basic statistical analysis in Python.
