Most Commonly, Fb Are Introduced Through The Anal Passage Or  Reach The Rectum After Oral Ingestion. We Describe Our Experience In The  Diagnosis And Treatment Of Fb Retained In The Rectum. Method: From 1997 To 2004,  Data Were Collected Prospectively In 30 Patients (20 Men And 10 Women; Median Age  42.5 Years). Extraction Method, Size And Type Of Object, And Postextraction  Evolution Were Reviewed. Results: The Fb Was Introduced Anally In 16 Cases And By  Oral Ingestion In 14. Principal Associated Factors Were: Mental Disorder In 11,  Penitentiary Confinement In Two, And Drug And Alcohol Intake In Two. Recent  Sexual Activity Had Taken Place In 14 Cases. The Size And Nature Of The Fb Were  Varied. The Most Frequent Symptom Was Constipation With Or Without Pelvic Or Anal  Discomfort (N = 23, 77%). Treatment Consisted Of Spontaneous Ejection (N = 2),  Digital Extraction With Or Without Enemas (N = 10), Digital Extraction Under  Local/Regional Anaesthesia After Fragmentation (N = 11) And Regional Exploratory  Laparotomy Under General Anaesthesia (N = 7). Grade I Rectal Trauma Was The Most  Common (N = 23, 77%). Six Patients Required Colostomy. Four Patients (13.5%)  Suffered Complications And None Died. Only 17 Patients Were Hospitalized, With A  Mean Stay Of 6 Days. All Patients Recovered Without Sequelae.

Main Outcome Measurements: Characteristics Of  Ingestion Cases, Endoscopic Extraction, Need For Surgery, And Complications.  Results: Among 262 Cases, 92% Were Intentional, 85% Involved Psychiatric  Patients, And 84% Occurred In Patients With Prior Ingestions. The Time From  Ingestion To Presentation Was >48 Hours In 168 Cases (64%). The Overall Success  Rate For Endoscopic Extraction Was 90% (165/183 Cases).

Financial Cost  Analysis Was Performed Using Hospital Billing And Cost Systems. Results: Commonly  Ingested Fbs Included Pens (23.6%), Batteries (9.2%), Knives (7.2%), And Razor  Blades (6.9%). Most Endoscopic Procedures Were Performed Under General  Anesthesia. Fbs Were Commonly Retrieved By Snares (58.0%), Rat-Toothed Forceps  (14.4%), And Nets (11.5%), Assisted Sometimes By Use Of Overtubes (10.8%), And  Hoods (4.6%). Fb Extraction Was Unsuccessful At The Initial Endoscopy In Only 20  Cases; 2 Cases Eventually Required Surgical Extraction. Minor Complications  Occurred In 11 Endoscopies. There Were No Deaths Or Perforations. The Total  Estimated Costs Were $2,018,073 ($1,500,627 In Hospital Costs, $240,640 In  Physician Fees, And $276,806 For Security Services). Costs Were Significantly  Higher For Inpatients. Major Payers Were Medicare (48%) And Medicaid (31%).  Conclusions: Intentional Fb Ingestion Occurs Among A Relatively Small Number Of  Patients With Psychiatric Disorders And Is Costly. Endoscopic Retrieval Is  Relatively Effective And Safe, But Often Requires General Anesthesia. These Cases  Utilize Significant Hospital And Fiscal Resources. Attention Should Be Focused On  Preventing These Recurrent And Costly Episodes.","2010","2025-01-28 08:43:20","2025-01-28 08:43:20","","","","","","","Clinical Gastroenterology And Hepatology : The Official Clinical Practice Journal Of The American Gastroenterological Association","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed","","","","","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/X6TE5UDY/Huang et al. - 2010 - Intentional Swallowing Of Foreign Bodies Is A Recu.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Certain Radiologic Findings Are Commonly Seen In Cases Of Attempted Suicide And Other Self-Injurious Behaviors. In Some Cases, Especially When The Patient Is Unconscious Or Is Unwilling To Provide A History, It May Not Be Apparent That Suicide Has Been Attempted Until Characteristic Imaging Findings Are Recognized. Correct Identification Of Suicide Attempts On The Basis Of Such Findings Will Ensure That These Patients Receive Appropriate Psychiatric Treatment. When A Suicide Attempt Is Unsuccessful, It Is Important To Be Familiar With The Complications That May Contribute To Delayed Mortality And Morbidity.

Methods:  After Obtaining Permission To Conduct Iifo Research In Incarcerated Populations,  Study Patients Were Identified By Icd-9 Codes. Patient Charts Were Reviewed For  Demographics; Past Medical History; Iifo Characteristics; And Diagnostic,  Endoscopic, And Surgical Findings. Univariate And Multivariate Analyses Were  Performed Using Statistical Software. Results: Thirty Patients With 141 Episodes  Of Iifo Were Identified. The Mean Number Of Ingested Items Per Episode Was 4.60.  Endoscopy Was Performed In 97 Of 141 Iifo Instances, With Failure To Retrieve The  Ingested Object In 21 Of 97 Cases (22%). Eleven Instances (7.8%) Required  Surgical Intervention.

Unintentional Foreign Body Ingestion Commonly Occurs Accidentally In Children Aged Between 3 Months And 6 Years And At Advanced Ages Or Results From Psychiatric Disorders Such As Hallucination In Patients With Mental Retardation. Most Of The Ingested Foreign Bodies Are Naturally Discharged From The Body But Some Of Them May Require Surgical Intervention. Presentation Of Case. A 29-Year-Old Mentally Retarded Female Patient Was Admitted To The Emergency Service With A Two-Day History Of Abdominal Pain, Nausea, And Vomiting. Physical Examination Revealed Abdominal Tenderness, Defense, And Rebound On Palpation.

Our Previous Research Examined Determinants Of Hospital Admission, Endoscopy, And Surgery Among Prisoners Who Ingest Foreign Objects. However, Little Is Known About The Financial Impact Of These Events On Healthcare Facilities That Service The Prisoner Population. This Study Aims To Fill This Gap By Examining Hospital Charges Attributable To 435 Prisoner Episodes Of Iifo. Methods: A Retrospective Review Of All Prisoners Who Presented To Our Medical Center With The Complaint Of Iifo Was Conducted. Both Institutional Review Board And Bureau Of Prisons Approvals Were Obtained Before Data Collection. All Prisoners Ages 18-75 Were Included Between The Dates Of January 2004 And December 2011. Episodes Were Divided Into Three Categories: (A) Unverified Iifo Wherein Ingested Object Was Claimed By The Patient But Never Identified; (B) Verified Iifo Wherein Ingested Object Was Clearly Identified; (C) Secondary Events Due To Direct Complications Of Previous Iifo Episode (S). The Temporal Occurrence Of Iifo Was Organized By Increasing The Number Of Episodes And Grouped Accordingly. Detailed List Of Hospital Charges Was Obtained For Every Iifo Episode Including: (A) Emergency Services, (B) Procedures, (C) Laboratory, (D) Surgical Supplies, (E) Allied Health Services, (F) Radiology Studies, (G) Anesthesiology Charges, (H) Pharmacy, And (H) Intensive Care Costs. Descriptive Statistics Were Used To Analyze Basic Data. Kruskal-Wallis Test Was Used To Examine Differences Among Nonnormally Distributed Variables And Sub-Groups. Statistical Significance Set At Alpha = 0.05. Results: A Total Of 435 Iifo Episodes Occurred During The Study Period In A Population Of 125 Patients (Mean Age 33.8 +/- 11.7 Years, Median Age 34 [Range 19-75] Years, 92.8% Male). Hospital Charges Associated With These Episodes Totaled $6,209,557. There Were 94 Unverified Iifos, 332 Verified Iifos, And 9 Secondary Events. Verified Iifos Were Associated With Significantly Greater Median Charges ($5,860) Than Unverified Iifos ($3,997) And Secondary Events Carried Lower Cost ($3,501) Than The Former Two (P < 0.01). We Also Observed A Pattern Of Escalating Costs Associated With Increasing Number Of Sequential Iifo Episodes, With The 1St Episode Carrying Median Charges Of $4,683 And Episodes Numbered 11+ Carrying Median Charges Of $7,698 (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Hospital Charges Associated With The Care Of Prisoners Who Ingest Foreign Objects Tend To Escalate Over Time. Although Charges In Most Of The Categories Demonstrated Increases With Greater Numbers Of Ingestions, The Largest Contributors To This Pattern Of Escalating Charges Included Radiology, Pharmacy, Hospital Room Charges, And Surgical Services. These Findings Suggest That Early Intervention In The Destructive Cycle Of Iifo May Not Only Improve Patient Outcomes But Also Result In Savings To The Healthcare System.

Methods: Inedible Substance Ingestion Incidents Were Extracted From An Incident Report Database Spanning 2000–2012 At A 400‐Bed Psychiatric Hospital In Japan. We Tabulated The Frequencies Of Incidents In Accordance With Major Diagnosis, Ingested Materials, Incident Levels, And Time Of Occurrence. Results: The Incidence Rate Was 0.09/1000 Patient Days, And 149 Cases In 105 Patients Were Classified As Having Experienced Inedible Substance Ingestion. The Most Common Diagnosis Was Dementia (N = 58), Followed By Schizophrenia (N = 22). Materials Ingested By Dementia Patients Were Nappies Or Gauze Attached To The Patient'S Body After Medical Procedures. Materials Ingested By Schizophrenic Patients Were Liquid Soap, Detergent Or Shampoo, And Cigarettes. Inedible Substance Ingestion Among Dementia Patients Occurred Mostly Before Or During Meals.

Here, We Report A Case Of Intentionally Swallowed Coins In The  Oesophagus Of An Adult; The Coins Could Not Be Detected On Chest Radiography But  Were Detected Using Computed Tomography (Ct). Case Presentation: A 46-Year-Old  Woman With A History Of Depression Presented To The Emergency Department After An  Intentional Medication Overdose And Ingestion Of Two Japanese 1-Yen Coins. She  Complained Of Persistent Retrosternal Discomfort. In Order To Confirm Whether The  Coins Were In The Oesophagus Or Trachea, An Anteroposterior Chest Radiograph Was  Obtained; However, No Coins Were Detected. Owing To Her Persistent Symptoms, A  Chest Ct Was Performed. On The Initial Ct Scan, Two 1-Yen Coins Were Observed In  The Oesophagus: One In The Middle Oesophagus And The Other In The Lower  Oesophagus. After The Scanning, The Patient Drank Water With Permission, But  Vomited. No Coins Were Found In Her Vomit, And The Symptoms Of Retrosternal  Discomfort Had Completely Disappeared. A Subsequent Ct Scan Revealed That The Two  1-Yen Coins Were In The Patient'S Stomach. Conclusions: Japanese 1-Yen Coins Are  Made Of 100% Aluminium, Which Is Less Radiopaque Than The Metals That Make Up  Coins (Nickel, Bronze, And Lead), And So, They Were Not Visible Via Chest  Radiography In Our Case. Detecting Very Small Or Thin Radiolucent Foreign Bodies  Is Not Possible Using A Chest Radiograph Or Contrast Oesophagram, But Is Possible  Via Ct. Ct Is Both Increasingly Convenient And Non-Invasive, Unlike Endoscopy Or  Bronchoscopy, And So, The Use Of Ct Scans Should Be Considered In Cases Of  Possible Radiolucent Foreign Body Ingestion.","2017","2025-01-28 08:43:21","2025-01-28 08:43:21","","","","","","","International Journal Of Emergency Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed","","","","","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/T7LMIRYY/Takahashi et al. - 2017 - Oesophageal Coins Invisible On Chest Radiography .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Iifos Often Require Surgical Or Endoscopic Interventions, Extended Hospital Stays, And May Result In Significant Morbidity Or Even Mortality. Although Psychiatric Illness Is Prevalent Among Prisoners Engaging In Iifo, This Association Remains Poorly Defined. The Aim Of This Study Is To Describe The Psychiatric Illness Profile Among Prisoners Diagnosed With Iifo. We Hypothesized That Repeated Episodes Of Iifo Are Associated With An Escalating Pattern Of Documented Psychiatric Illness. Methods: After Approvals Were Obtained From Our Institutional Review Board And The Ohio Department Of Rehabilitation And Correction, A Retrospective Study Was Conducted Of Prisoners Presenting To Our Facility With Iifo Between 2004 And 2011. All Historical And Concurrent Psychiatric Diagnoses Were Abstracted From The Medical Record And Classified Into Diagnostic And Statistical Manual Of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition Based Categories. In Addition, Medical History, Alcohol/Drug Use, And Prior Episodes Of Iifo Were Recorded. Statistical Analyses Included Chi-Square And Kruskal-Wallis Tests For Categorical And Continuous Data, Respectively. Results: We Analyzed 136 Iifo Episodes Involving 27 Patients. Repeat Iifo Episodes Were Associated With An Increasing Number Of Psychiatric Diagnoses. Patients With Their Fifth Or Later Iifo Had A Larger Number Of Psychiatric Diagnoses And The Number Of Objects Ingested As Compared To Patients Presenting With A First Episode (P < 0.01). Similarly, Patients Who Went On To Present With Additional Episodes Of Iifo During The Study Had More Psychiatric Diagnoses Identified Throughout Their Visits (P < 0.01). The Proportion Of Patients With Mood And Anxiety Disorders (Including Post-Traumatic Stress) Was Progressively Greater Among Prisoners With Recurrent Episodes Of Iifo (P < 0.05). Other Psychiatric Disorders Were Not Significantly Associated With Iifo Escalation. Conclusions: We Observed A Significant Association Between Iifo Recurrences And Increases In Both The Quantity Of Ingested Items And The Number Of Documented Psychiatric Diagnoses. Of Note, Psychiatric Diagnoses Of Malingering Or Secondary Gain Were Not Identified In The Current Patient Sample. Consideration Of Early Psychiatric Evaluation And Intervention In The Setting Of Iifo, Especially Recurrent Iifo, Is Strongly Encouraged.

This Study Aimed To Analyse The Circumstances Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts In A Japanese Psychiatric Hospital So As To Improve Management And Care. Methods: Incident Reports Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts During A 12.4-Year Period From November 2000 To March 2013 Were Reviewed. A Descriptive Analysis Was Conducted In Terms Of Age, Sex, And Diagnosis Of Patients, As Well As Level, Ward, Situations, And Causes Of Incidents. Results: During The Study Period, 90 Cases Of Self-Harm And Attempted Suicide Involving 58 Patients Were Reported. The Rate Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts Was 0.05 Per 1000 Patient-Days. The Types Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts Included Hanging (N = 25), Wrist Cutting (N = 19), Ingestion Of Foreign Objects (N = 17), And Others (N = 29). The Single Case Of Completed Suicide Involved Hanging, In A Patient With Schizophrenia. Among 55 Patients With Relevant Data, The Most Common Clinical Diagnosis Was Mood Disorder (41.8%), Followed By Schizophrenia (36.4%). Mood Disorder Was 3.5 Times As Prevalent In Females As In Males (14 Vs. 4). Fourteen Patients With Mood Disorder (N = 8) Or Schizophrenia (N = 6) Were Repeatedly Involved In 46 Of 89 Cases Of Self-Harm Or Attempted Suicide; 11 Were Female. One Woman With Mood Disorder Attempted Suicide 9 Times Within The Same Year. The Top 3 Management And Care Factors Related To Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts Were Failure To Adhere To Preventive Procedures (28%), Insufficient Therapeutic Communication (28%), And Difficulty In Predicting Suicide (20%). Conclusion: Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts At This Psychiatric Hospital Occurred At A Rate Of 0.05 Per 1000 Patient-Days Between Late 2000 And Early 2013.

In China, There Have Been A Few Studies Investigating The Prevalence Of Dsh In Heroin-Dependent Patients (Hdps), But Their Rates Varied Widely. We Thus Conducted A Meta-Analysis Of Studies Assessing The Prevalence Of Dsh Among Chinese Hdps. Methods: Relevant Studies Were Retrieved From Major Chinese Databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, And Sinomed) And Western Databases (Pubmed, Embase, And Psycinfo). Two Authors Independently Identified Eligible Studies And Extracted Data. Studies That Included A Representative Sample Of Chinese Hdps And Ascertained Dsh Caseness In A Reliable Way Were Considered As High Quality. Statistical Analysis Was Performed Using R Software. Results: In Total, 15 Eligible Studies With A Total Of 37,243 Chinese Hdps Were Included. All Included Studies Were Conducted In Heroin Detoxification Settings. Only Two Studies Were Rated As High Quality. The Pooled Prevalence Of Dsh In Chinese Hdps Was 4.4% (95%Ci: 2.9, 6.2%), But The Heterogeneity Of Prevalence Rates Across Studies Was Significant (I2 = 98%, P < 0.001). Studies Rated As High Quality Had Significantly Higher Prevalence Of Dsh Than Those Rated As Low Quality (13.2 Vs. 3.4%, P < 0.001). Swallowing Foreign Objects Was The Most Common Method Of Dsh, With A Combined Prevalence Of 2.7% (95%Ci: 1.6, 4.4%). Extreme Dsh Methods Such As Cutting Offfingers And Jumping From Height Were Also Not Uncommon In This Patient Population. Conclusion: Due To Methodological Problems In Available Studies, We Find A Relatively Low Prevalence Of Dsh Among Chinese Hdps Receiving Detoxification Treatment. Nevertheless, The Self-Harmers Of Chinese Hdps Are More Likely To Harm Themselves In A Dangerous Or Life-Threatening Way. Restricting The Availability Of Dsh Methods May Be An Effective Way To Prevent Or Reduce Dsh In China'S Detoxification Treatment Settings. © 2018 Zhong, Xu, Xie, Chen And Lu.","2018","2025-01-28 08:43:22","2025-01-28 08:43:22","","","","","","","Frontiers In Psychiatry","","","","","","","","","","","SCOPUS","","","","","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/2T43KERH/Zhong B.-L. et al. - 2018 - Prevalence Of Deliberate Self-Harm Among Chinese P.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Medical Records Of 74  Pediatric Patients From 9 Large Chinese Hospitals During The Past 10 Years, Who  Were Diagnosed As Buckyball Magnets Ingestion And Got Invasive Treatment, Were  Retrospectively Studied. The Follow-Up Was Through Telephone And Outpatient  Service To Estimate The Post-Surgery Condition. Information Collection Was  Through Online Questionnaire. Results: Among The 74 Cases, There Were 50 Boys  (68%) And 24 Girls (32%). The Median Age Was 36 (Interquartile Range (Iqr) 22-77)  Months, With A Range Of 7 Months To 11 Years, And It Showed Two Peaks, The First  Between 1 And 3 Years, And The Second Between 6 To 11 Years. The Annual Case  Number Showed A Sharp Increase Over Time, And The Total Case Number In The Last  2 Years (2017 And 2018) Showed A Greater Than 9-Fold Increase When Compared With  The First 2 Years (2013 And 2014). The Majority Of Ingestions Were Unintentional,  With Only 3 Patients Deliberately Swallowing The Buckyball Magnets. The Median  Time Of Ingestion Until The Onset Of Emergent Symptoms Was 2 (Iqr 1-5) Days, And  Ranged From 4 H To 40 Days. Twenty-One Patients Had No Symptoms, And The  Remaining Cases Presented With Abdominal Pain, Vomiting, Fever, Abdominal  Distension, Excessive Crying, Melena, And The Ceasing Of Flatus And Defecation.  Gastroscopy, Colonoscopy, Laparoscopic Surgery And Laparotomy Surgery Were  Performed In Accordance With The Algorithm From The North American Society Of  Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology And Nutrition (Naspghan). Procedural And  Operative Findings Included Gastrointestinal Mucosa Erosion, Ischemia And  Necrosis, Perforation, And Abdominal Abscess, Fistula And Intestinal Obstruction.  The Median Number Of Buckyball Magnets Ingested Was 4 (Iqr 2-8), With A Range  From 1 To 39. During The Median Follow-Up Period Of 6 (Iqr 1-15) Months, 3  Patients Had Intestinal Obstruction, And One Underwent A Second Operation. The  Remaining 71 Patients Courses Were Uneventful During The Follow-Up Period. None  Of The 74 Patients Reported A Second Swallowing Of Foreign Bodies. Conclusions:  The Incidence Of Pediatric Gastrointestinal Tract Magnets Ingestion In China Is  Increasing. Management Of Such Patients Should Follow The Naspghan Algorithm.  Preventive Measures To Limit Children'S Access To Buckyball Magnets Should Be  Taken From Three Levels, Namely The National Administration, Producer, And  Consumer.","2020","2025-01-28 08:43:22","2025-01-28 08:43:22","","","","","","","Bmc Pediatrics","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed","","","","","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/HHELJUSB/Wang et al. - 2020 - Multicenter Investigation Of Pediatric Gastrointes.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our Study Aimed To Compare The Prevalence Of  Different Age, Gender, Types, Locations And Management Of Fb Ingested Between  Intentional Ingestion And Accidental Ingestion Of Fb In Northern China. Methods:  A Retrospective Case Series Studied All Patients With Suspected Fb Ingestion In  Digestive Endoscopy Center Of Beijing Friendship Hospital, Between January 2011  And January 2019. The Patients Were Divided Into 2 Groups. Group A Included The  Patients Who Intentionally Ingested Fbs, And Group B Included The Patients Who  Accidentally Ingested Fbs. Patients' Database (Demographics, Past Medical  History, Characteristics Of Fb, Endoscopic Findings And Treatments) Were  Reviewed. Statistical Analyses Were Conducted Using Spss Software. Results: Group  A Consisted Of 77 Prisoners, 2 Suspects And 11 Psychologically Disabled Persons.  Group B Consisted Of 1020 Patients With No Prisoners, Suspects Or Psychologically  Disabled Persons. In Group A, There Were No Food-Related Foreign Bodies, And The  Majority Of Fbs Were Metallic Objects (54.44%). However In Group B, Food-Related  Fbs Were The Most Common (91.37%). In Group A, 58 Cases (64.44%) Were Located In  The Stomach, While In Group B, 893 Cases (87.55%) Were Located In The Esophagus  (P < 0.05). 1096 Patients Successfully Underwent Endoscopic Removal And 14  Failed, Including 9 Cases In Group A And 5 Cases In Group B. The Duration Of Fbs  Impaction Was Longer In Group A Than That In Group B (P < 0.05). Conclusions: In  Our Study, The Patients Who Intentionally Ingested Fb Were Mainly Prisoners, Fbs  Were Mostly Sharp Metallic Objects, The Duration Of Fbs Impaction Was Longer, And  The Rate Of Successful Endoscopic Treatment Was Lower Than That Of The General  Population.

Mental Health Disorders In Adolescents Present Some Of The Most Challenging Of All Ethical Dilemmas. This Is Particularly True When They Lead To Self-Injurious Behavior That Can Only Be Prevented By Either Limiting The Freedom Of The Adolescent Or Forcing Treatments On Them That They Do Not Want. Intentional And Repeated Foreign-Body Ingestion (Fbi) In Youth Is A Poorly Understood Self-Injurious Behavior That Can Be Life-Threatening. It Poses Unique Clinical And Ethical Challenges. Ingestion Of Sharp Or Magnetic Objects Increases The Need For Endoscopic Retrieval Or Surgical Intervention With Associated Risks, Including Perforation And Anesthesia-Related Adverse Events. When Behavior Modification Efforts Fail To Prevent Recurrent Fbi, The Cumulative Risk Of Medical Intervention Mounts. Sometimes, As A Last Resort, Doctors Consider Surgical Procedures That Limit Jaw Movement And May Physically Prevent Recurrent Fbi. In This Ethics Rounds Article, We Present A Case In Which Doctors Consider Whether It Is In The Best Interest Of A Teenager With This Behavior To Undergo Orthodontic Jaw Wiring As A Next Step In Treatment Of Repeated Fbi.

However, Trends And Patterns Of Adult Fobis As Well As Associations With Clinical Comorbidities And Behavioral Attributes Have Not Been Elucidated Beyond Single Institutional Experiences. Methods: We Utilized Survey Data From The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System To Examine Fundamental Characteristics Of Adult Fobis Involving Consumer Products Between 2000 And 2017 Across The United States. Data Regarding The Circumstances Of Fobis Were Abstracted From Narrative Data. Relationships Among Time, Intent, Demographics, And Behavioral Attributes Were Assessed Using Regression Analyses, Accounting For Survey Structure. Results: Adult Fobis Have Increased In Incidence Over The Past 2 Decades From 3 To 5.3 Per 100,000 Persons. Examination Of Consumer Products Revealed That Jewelry (15.4%), Nails (7.2%), And Toothpicks (6.9%) Were The Most Commonly Ingested Products. The Most Common Products Ingested Varied Over Time, And The Number Of Unique Consumer Product Categories Ingested Increased From 103 To 143 In The Time Period Studied. Intentional Ingestions Accounted For 14% Of Adult Fobis And Frequently Involved Plastic Bagging (13.6%), Batteries (13%), Nails (10.1%), And Desk Supplies (6.8%). Adjusted Regression Analyses Demonstrated That Compared With Accidental Fobis, Intentional Fobis Have Increased Over Time. Intentional Fobis Were More Frequently Associated With Younger Age, Substance Abuse, Police Custody, And Mental And Cognitive Illnesses Relative To Accidental Fobis.

Risk  Factors For Rifb Ingestion Include Male Sex, Incarceration, And The Presence Of A  Psychiatric Disorder. Most Patients Can Be Managed With Observation And  Endoscopy. Surgery Is Indicated In Cases Involving Perforation Or Obstruction.  The Literature On Preventative Strategies For Rifb Ingestion Is Scarce. Case  Report A 23-Year-Old Man Required 6 Admissions In 1 Calendar Year For Intentional  Foreign Body Ingestions. The Patient Was Living In Prison And Had A History Of  Bipolar I Disorder, Schizophrenia, And Borderline Personality Disorder. He  Underwent 9 Endoscopic Procedures That Retrieved A Total Of 64 Objects. The  Primary Imaging Modalities Were Abdominal X-Ray And Abdominopelvic  Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography Scan. The Patient Was Managed With  Endoscopy And, In 2 Cases, With Observation Alone. Serial Abdominal Examinations  And Abdominal Films Were Used To Monitor The Progress Of Foreign Bodies That Were  Difficult To Retrieve. A Bowel Regimen With Polyethylene Glycol Facilitated The  Passage Of The Objects. The Patient Never Required Surgical Intervention. The  Mean Length Of Stay Was 4.17 Days. The Recurrent Ingestions May Have Been Related  To Compulsions And Family Stress. Conclusions Interdisciplinary Collaboration Is  Paramount In Formulating Effective Treatment Plans And Limiting Recurrence.  Proposed Strategies To Prevent Rifb Ingestion Include The Removal Of Ingestible  Objects From The Environment, Specialized Prison Units For Close Monitoring,  Early Psychiatric Intervention With Appropriate Pharmacologic/Behavioral Therapy,  And Limiting Hospital Admissions To Prevent Secondary Gain.

Bowel Perforation By Foreign Body Ingestion Has Been Believed To Be Relatively Rare, And Most Commonly Caused By Fish Bones, Chicken Bones, And Toothpicks. Our Clinical Experience, However, Suggests Such Perforations May Be More Common Than Previously Thought, And Caused By Various Other Objects As Well. Medical Records Of All Patients Diagnosed With Foreign Body-Induced Intestinal Perforation, From The Department Of General Surgery At Tonji Hospital, From January 2000 To June 2015, Were Retrospectively Analyzed. A Total Of 17 Men And 8 Women Suffered Intestinal Perforations By Ingestion Of Dietary Foreign Bodies. Among The 25 Total Patients, 4 Ingested Foreign Bodies Intentionally, Whereas The Other 21 Cases Were Accidental. The Foreign Bodies Were Identified By Plain X-Ray Film In 2 Patients (2 Cases Of Needles) And By Multidetector Computed Tomography (Mdct) In 11 Patients (6 Cases Of Date Stones, 3 Cases Of Metallic Objects, And 2 Cases Of Bone Fragments), Thus Supporting The Correct Preoperative Diagnosis (13 Cases; 52%). The Most Common Location Of The Perforation Was The Terminal Ileum (N = 17). The Offending Objects Were Date Stones (N = 13), Bones (N = 7), And Metallic Objects (N = 5). The Most Common Treatment Was Removal Of The Foreign Body And Closure Of The Perforation With Simple Suture (N = 22). Ten Patients Were Treated Laparoscopically. The Present Study Shows That The Most Common Foreign Bodies Causing Intestinal Perforation Are Date Stones And Bones. Although About 50% Of The Foreign Bodies Could Be Identified By Mdct, Definite Diagnosis Remained Preoperatively Difficult. Consequently, Because Of High Misdiagnosis Rates, Laparoscopy May Be The Optimal Choice For Diagnosis And Treatment Of Bowel Perforation By Foreign Bodies.","2021","2025-01-28 08:43:23","2025-01-28 08:43:23","","","","","","","International Surgery","","","","","","","","","","","Web of Science","","","","","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/2AKTMDY6/Li et al. - 2021 - Intestinal Perforation By Ingested Foreign Bodies.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A Pubmed And Google Scholar Search  Discovered A Variety Of Case Reports Detailing Various Methods And Indications  For Endoscopic Retrieval Of Right Sided Colonic Foreign Bodies. This Case Report  Endeavors To Supplement The Literature So That Guidelines Can One Day Be  Established For Colonoscopic Retrieval Of Right-Sided Foreign Bodies. Case  Presentation: 36-Year-Old Male Prisoner Swallowed 6.5 Cm Nail Clippers With A  Long-Standing History Of Intentional Foreign Body Ingestion (Fbi) Including  Multiple Laparotomies For Foreign Body Retrievals. Computerized Tomography (Ct)  Was Used Initially To Confirm The Position Of The Nail Clippers.

Mostly Fbs Are Found Ingested Accidently Or Intentionally In Children And Adults With Mental  Status Alterations. Depending On The Type Of Object, Different Complications Can  Occur. There Exist Numerous Methods For Removing Each Specific Fb. Fortunately,  Most Fbs Tend To Move Uneventfully Through The Gastrointestinal Tract Without Any  Intervention; But Managing Some Foreign Objects Can Be Difficult And Lead To  Severe Complications. Endoscopy Helps With The Diagnosis And Treatment Of These  Cases, But The Time Of The Management Plays An Important Role. Case Presentation:  A 26-Year-Old Female Who Intentionally Swallowed Two Sewing Needles, Presented To  Our Emergency Department With Abdominal Pain Two Months After The Fb Ingestion.  One Of The Sewing Needles Was Spontaneously Excreted Through The Bowel, And The  Other Was Present In Her Body For Two Months. The Fb Had Penetrated The Stomach  And Migrated To The Peritoneal Cavity. The Patient'S Condition Was Managed By  Laparoscopic Removal Of The Fb And Repair Of The Damaged Tissue. According To The  Traumatic Nature Of The Needle To Abdominal Viscera, And Standing Outside The Gi  Tract On The Pancreas Surface, Laparoscopic Removal Of The Foreign Metallic Body  Was Chosen To Be Performed. No Complication Was Seen During The Postoperative  Period. Conclusion: This Report Emphasizes The Importance Of Prompt Evaluation Of  Fb Patients And Finding The Appropriate Method Of Managing Its Complications.  Preventing Complications Requires Focusing On Symptoms And Instant Management Of  The Ingested Fbs.","2022","2025-01-28 08:43:23","2025-01-28 08:43:23","","","","","","","Annals Of Medicine And Surgery (2012)","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed","","","","","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/V2NL5CP7/Bozorgmehr et al. - 2022 - A Rare Case Of Abdominal Foreign Bodies; Laparosco.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Radiological Examinations Play A Crucial Role In  Determining The Exact Location Of The Object Within The Gastrointestinal Tract  And In Planning For Its Removal By Endoscopic Or Surgical Intervention. Methods:  Medical And Radiological Records Of 8 Patients Who Had Swallowed The Broken Heads  Or Entire Toothbrush Were Retrospectively Reviewed. This Series Included 4 Men  And 4 Women, Ranging In Age From 21 To 57 Years (Mean: 34 Years).

We Implemented A Foreign Body Algorithm  (Fba) Designed To Delay All But The Most Urgent Endoscopy For Efi And Fbi Until  Regular Working Hours. Methods: Using Endoscopy Records From Multiple Academic  And Community Hospitals Within A Large Integrated Health System In The United  States, We Identified Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (Egd) Performed For Food  Impactions And Foreign Body Ingestions Occurring Between May 2011 And February  2021. Results: We Identified 479 Egds Performed For Fbi And Efi. The Introduction  Of The Fba Was Associated With A Shorter Length Of Stay (Los) For Overall Cases  (0.35 Vs. 0.8 D P <0.001), Day Cases (0.16 Vs. 1.0 D P <0.001), And Night Cases  (0.40 Vs. 0.6 D P =0.03). The Introduction Of The Fba Did Not Change The Rate Of  Overall Adverse Events (Ae) Or Night Ae. Ae From The Entire Cohort Was Rare (3%;  16 Total). Of The Ae, Most Were Sedation Related. The Introduction Of The Fba Did  Not Affect The Overall Rate Of Night Cases Or Ae, But The Rate Of After-Hours  Endoscopy For Intentional Ingestions Decreased From 17.2% To 3.1% ( P =0.01).

The Aim Of This Study Is To Describe The Profile Of Inmates Who Have Ingested Foreign Bodies, To Determine The Nature Of These Foreign Bodies And To Specify Their Management. Materials And Methods: Our Retrospective And Descriptive Study Focused' On 13 Inmates Having Ingested' 47 Foreign Bodies And Who Consulted The Emergency Of Our Department Over A 5-Year Period From January 2018 To July 2023. Results: The Study Population Consisted Of 12 Men And One Woman With An Average Age Of 32 Years (24 Years-47 Years). Foreign Bodies Ingested By Inmates Were Dominated By Batteries (59.52%) Followed By Lighters (19.04%). The Majoritý Of Foreign Bodies Were, At The Time Of Discovery, Located Mainly In The Stomach (6 Cases) And Colon (4 Cases). Ingestion Resulted In Epigastric Pain (3 Cases), Externalized Gastrointestinal Bleeding With Epigastralgia (2 Cases), And No Symptoms (8 Cases). Of The 13 Cases Of Foreign Body Ingestion, 6 Patients Underwent Endoscopic Extraction In The Gastroenterology Department. Extraction Was By Diathermic Loop, Dormia Loop And Endoscopic Basket. Successful Extraction Was Achieved In 4 Cases (66.66%), And Unsuccessful Extraction In 2 Cases (33.33%). Only One Inmate Required Surgical Extraction, And In 6 Patients The Elimination Of Foreign Bodies In The Stool Was Spontaneous Under Medical Supervision. Conclusion: Foreign Body Ingestion Is Frequent And Voluntary In The Prison Environment. It Is Characterized By The Multiplicity Of Foreign Bodies. The Rate Of Successful Extraction Of Ingested Foreign Bodies In Our Practice Is Satisfactory, Requiring An Experienced Endoscopist To Perform The Extraction Without Complications And Avoid Recourse To Surgery.

Adolescents And Young Adults May Carry Out This Act To Hurt Themselves Or Even Suicide. Often, Most Reports Related To Deliberate Swallowing Are Typically Either Surgical Or Gastrointestinal And Rarely Are Found In Psychiatric Articles; More Often, The Swallowed Foreign Objects (80 - 90%) Are Disposed Of Spontaneously, And 10 - 20% Of Them Require Endoscopy For More Study And Less Than 1% Of Them Need Surgery To Be Removed Or Its Complications. Case Presentation: The Presented Patient Is A 17-Year-Old Girl Admitted To The Psychosomatic Ward Of Afzalipour Hospital Due To Intentional Poisoning. During The Year Before Her Admission, On Three Separate Occasions, She Detached The Knife Blade From Its Haft And Swallowed It. She Underwent Laparotomy Twice, One Time For Sigmoid Tearing And Damage To The Left Ovary, To Remove The Knife And Regeneration Of The Left Ovary And Sigmoid, And Another Time To Remove The Knife In Order Not To Cause Damage To Her Intestines. To Our Knowledge, This Is The First Reported Case In The World In Which An Ovary Has Been Damaged. Further Investigation Into Her Background Shows Some Extent Of Privation Due To Her Family’S Long-Term Economic Problems And Instability; Moreover, Sexual And Physical Abuse Was Also Confirmed. The Patient Was Prescribed Clozapine, Which Decreased Her Suicidal Behavior And Attempts Noticeably. Conclusions: Swallowing Foreign Bodies In This Patient Is Interpreted As Both Self-Punishment And Punishing Others (Those Who Thought They Were Hurt Or May Be Blamed For Their Despair Or Rejection). Intentional Swallowing Of Foreign Objects Behavior Is More Resistant Than Other Self-Harming Activities And May Have A Worse Prognosis. Swallowing Foreign Objects Requires A Sophisticated Process That, If Not Correctly Managed, May Result In Serious Complications; Therefore, Appropriate Psychiatric Counseling And Supportive Treatment Are Necessary For These Patients. Specific To This Patient Eliminating The Effects Of Suicide And Reaching Medical Stability With A Short Admission Was Necessary. Her Suicidal Behavior And Attempts Decreased Significantly After Starting Clozapine Treatment. Therefore, Clozapine Treatment Is Recommended For Patients With Suicidal Behavior And Self-Harm. © 2023, Brieflands.

It Can Be Ingested Intentionally Or  Accidentally. The Small Bowel Bezoar Prevalence Ranges Between 0.4 % And 4 %, And  The Prevalence Is Less Than 0.5 % For Gastric Bezoars. There Are Different Types  Of Bezoars, But The Mention Of A Plastic Bezoar Rarely Appears In The Literature.  To Our Knowledge, This Is The First Reported Case Of A Plastic Bezoar In The  Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia. Case Presentation: A 58-Year-Old Woman Was Admitted For  Acute Kidney Injury, And While Working Her Up, It Was Discovered That She Had A  Possible Foreign Body On Computerized Tomography Scan. As A Result, She Underwent  Exploratory Laparotomy With The Findings Of Plastic Foreign Objects Identified  90 Cm From The Ileocecal Valve And Other Objects Identified In The Stomach.  Clinical Discussion: The Impaction Of These Materials Often Occurs In Narrow  Areas Such As The Lower Esophagus, Duodenum, Ileocecal Valve Or Even The Anus. In  This Unique Case, Two Points Of Impaction Were Noted: The First Was In The Small  Bowel And The Second Point In The Stomach. The Approach To Such Cases Could Be  Endoscopic Versus Surgical Or Even Chemical Dissolution As A Choice Of Treatment  Is Dependent On Multiple Factors. Conclusion: The Approach To These Cases Is  Multidisciplinary And Depends On The Availability Of Services And Resources At  The Treating Hospital. Reporting Such Cases Helps In Managing Challenging  Situations. Additionally, A Psychiatric Assessment Is A Crucial Step.","2024","2025-01-28 08:43:24","2025-01-28 08:43:24","","","","","","","International Journal Of Surgery Case Reports","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed","","","","","","/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/95N7IV9V/Sultan et al. - 2024 - A Plastic Bezoar Causing Bowel Obstruction A Case.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Purpose: To Evaluate The  Potential Value Of Computed Tomography (Ct) In Guiding The Selection Of Surgical  Treatment For Patients With Ingested Foreign Bodies In The Lower Gastrointestinal  Tract. Methods: Between January 2014 And December 2023, We Analyzed The Data Of  58 Patients (Median Age: 65.4 Years; Range, 31-96 Years) With Ingested Foreign  Bodies In The Lower Gastrointestinal Tract Who Underwent Ct Examinations.  Patients Were Treated Either Conservatively (35 Cases) Or Surgically (23 Cases).  The Angle Between The Long Axis Of The Foreign Body And The Intestinal Canal  (Fb-Ic Angle) Was Measured. Ct Findings And Clinical Variables Were Evaluated To  Identify Potential Indicators For Surgical Treatment Through Univariate And  Multivariate Logistic Regression Analyses. Results: Univariate Analysis Revealed  The Fb-Ic Angle (P = 0.002), Presence Of Free Peritoneal Gas (P = 0.002), White  Blood Cell Count (P = 0.018), And Neutrophil Count (P = 0.007) As Significant  Factors Associated With Surgical Treatment. Multivariate Analysis Demonstrated  That The Fb-Ic Angle (Odds Ratio, 1.033; P = 0.045) And The Presence Of Free  Peritoneal Gas (Odds Ratio, 41.335; P = 0.002) Are Independent Indicators For  Surgical Management. The Fb-Ic Angle Showed An Area Under The Receiver Operating  Characteristic Curve Of 0.755, With A Cutoff Value Of 51.25 Degrees.
