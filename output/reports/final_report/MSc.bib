  abstract = {Objectives:               Dilation of the right ventricle during cardiac arrest and resuscitation may be inherent to cardiac arrest rather than being associated with certain causes of arrest such as pulmonary embolism. This study aimed to compare right ventricle diameter during resuscitation from cardiac arrest caused by hypovolemia, hyperkalemia, or primary arrhythmia (i.e., ventricular fibrillation).                                         Design:               Thirty pigs were anesthetized and then randomized to cardiac arrest induced by three diffrent methods. Seven minutes of untreated arrest was followed by resuscitation. Cardiac ultrasonographic images were obtained during induction of cardiac arrest, untreated cardiac arrest, and resuscitation. The right ventricle diameter was measured. Primary endpoint was the right ventricular diameter at the third rhythm analysis.                                         Setting:               University hospital animal laboratory.                                         Subjects:               Female crossbred Landrace/Yorkshire/Duroc pigs (27--32 kg).                                         Interventions:               Pigs were randomly assigned to cardiac arrest caused by either hypovolemia, hyperkalemia, or primary arrhythmia.                                         Measurements and Main Results:                                At the third rhythm analysis during resuscitation, the right ventricle diameter was 32\,mm (95\% CI, 29--35) in the hypovolemia group, 29\,mm (95\% CI, 26--32) in the hyperkalemia group, and 25\,mm (95\% CI, 22--28) in the primary arrhythmia group. This was larger than baseline for all groups (                 p                 = 0.03). When comparing groups at the third rhythm analysis, the right ventricle was larger for hypovolemia than for primary arrhythmia (                 p                 {$<$} 0.001).                                                        Conclusions:               The right ventricle was dilated during resuscitation from cardiac arrest caused by hypovolemia, hyperkalemia, and primary arrhythmia. These findings indicate that right ventricle dilation may be inherent to cardiac arrest, rather than being associated with certain causes of arrest. This contradicts a widespread clinical assumption that in hypovolemic cardiac arrest, the ventricles are collapsed rather than dilated.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Recurrent and intentional ingestion of metallic objects is a rare but important phenomenon. It has attracted great interest among mental health  professionals over the last decades. However, this issue is rarely reported in  the literature. A deep exploration of its clinical and specific  psychopathological aspects remains limited. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a  32-year-old female patient, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for homicide  against her cousin, the daughter of an uncle who had raped her when she was 14.  This affair was hushed by the patient's family and the patient was submitted to  several acts of abuse by her family. Following her incarceration, she repeatedly  ingested metallic objects requiring repeated admissions in a department of  surgery for endoscopic extractions or surgical interventions. She impulsively  ingested more than 30 times various metallic objects such as wire, razor blades,  spoons, etc., under the pressure of impulsiveness and massive anxiety. Voluntary  metal ingestions, associated with iterative self-mutilation behaviors, took place  within the framework of a borderline personality disorder, the incarceration and  the conditions of imprisonment playing a role in initiating and retaining the  behavior. CONCLUSION: Through this case report, we examine the specific  psychiatric aspects of intentional ingestion of metallic objects in order to  better understand this behavior.},

  abstract = {Gastrointestinal foreign body (FB) obstruction in felines is one of the emergencies and commonly required surgical interventions. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate the risk factors that could prone cats to ingest FB. This study was retrospectively conducted on sixty-five cats that had been diagnosed with FB obstruction. On the other hand, sixty-five cats that had no clinical findings suggestive of gastrointestinal illnesses were used as controls. Among cats with gastrointestinal illnesses, we found that 9.97\% had FB obstructions. The most common presenting breeds of both cat patients with FB obstruction and controls were Persian and Siamese. Similarly, most of the presented normal and diseased cats were males. Cats with FB were younger (p{$<$}0.05) than those of control cats. There was no significant difference in the body weight for cats with FB versus control cats. Among the investigated factors, we also observed that living style, anxiety/stress, and frequency of exercise were the only factors that were strongly associated with the occurrence of FB obstruction. In conclusion, observations of this study indicate that a living style, anxiety/stress, and frequency of exercise have a significant impact on cat behavior and should be seen by cat-owned clients as important to prevent pica. Thus, the likelihood of blockage of the gastrointestinal tract by foreign bodies can be reduced.},

Material and methods The study was retrospective, conducted on peri-implant specimens submitted for histology between 2005 and 2021. Results Three hundred and thirty-five peri-implant biopsies were retrieved, of which 52 (15.5\%) were PGCG. The study population included 28 females and 24 males, age 35-92 years, mean 61. 51.2\% reported bone involvement. The lesion involved the margins of the specimen in 65.3\%, recurrence was reported in 46.1\%. In 58.8\% the implant was removed at the same time the specimen was submitted for histopathological analysis. Small foci of black granular foreign material were observed in 53.8\% of cases of which 67.8\% were birefringent under polarized light. The foreign material granules were not ingested inside multinucleated giant cells, but were scattered in the stromal compartment. Conclusions Peri-implant PGCG is locally aggressive, with frequent bone involvement and high recurrence rate, resulting in implant loss in the majority of cases. The high recurrence rate may be related to conservative or inadequate surgery. Foreign material although common does not seem to have a role in its development.},

The diagnosis of sepsis in such patients is often challenging and requires a high index of suspicion. The aim of this study is to report on a series of patient with ESRD on hemodialysis (HD) diagnosed with sepsis. Methods: Single center retrospective study looking at ESRD on HD who presented to our tertiary hospital were retrieved. Inclusion criteria included a discharge diagnosis of sepsis, septic shock or bacteremia. Results: Our sample was composed of 41 females and 49 males, with a mean age of 70 {\textpm} 15 years. Infections from the HD catheters followed by lower respiratory tract infections were the most common cause of bacteremia. IV fluid replacement for the first 6 and 24 h were 0.58 and 1.27 l respectively. Vasopressors were used in 30 patients with norepinephrine, dopamine and dobutamine used in 22, nine and one patients respectively. Out of 90 subjects, 24 (26.6 \%) were dead within the same hospital visit. the 28 days out of hospital mortality was 25.6 \%. There was no significant difference in mortality in patients who presented with less than two SIRS or two or more SIRS criteria. Conclusion: This is the first study looking at an in depth analysis of sepsis in the specific dialysis population and examining the influence of fluid resuscitation, role of SIRS criteria and vasopressor use on their mortality.},

A subset of this topic, the  intentional ingestion of foreign bodies, however, is much less common, and  requires special evaluation and management. Here, we report a case of ingestion  of a rolled, metal tuna can lid in a male prison inmate previously diagnosed with  depression and paranoid schizophrenia. Following evaluation by the surgical team,  the foreign body was removed by laparotomy and the patient was discharged back to  the prison without complication. In many cases, ingestions of this type involve a  command hallucination ordering the patient to swallow the foreign body.  Interestingly, the patient in the present case reported auditory hallucinations  commanding him not to swallow the can lid. On further investigation, we found  that patient had a proclivity toward this swallowing behavior even prior to his  incarceration. Early identification of inmates with this proclivity has important  implications for treatment and prevention.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Acuphagia is uncontrollable ingestion of metal or sharp objects. It is a psychiatric disorder. Few cases of recurrent acuphagia are reported in literature. We describe the case of a 27-year-old lady with recurrent episodes and the dilemma faced in management. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: 26-year-old lady with a past medical history multiple psychiatric disorders and an 8 year history of recurrent radio-opaque foreign body ingestion. She ingested a screw driver shaft and had previously ingested razor blades, 60 paper clips, spoons, bobby pins, pens, phone stylus. She required many esophagogastroduodenoscopies(EGDs) .Open laparotomy was done once for gastric perforation. Recurrent ingestion was related to craving anesthetic agents as a means of relieving anxiety. At review, her vital signs were stable. The foreign body was visualized on x ray and successfully removed from the stomach using a snare at EGD.Her medications were adjusted by psychiatry. She represented a month later after swallowing an unfolded paper clip confirmed on imaging. Due to lack of symptoms and adjudged low risk, EGD was not done, leaving her dissatisfied. DISCUSSION: Foreign body ingestion is more common in children compared to adults. Adult foreign body ingestion is increasing.(1) Recurrent intentional ingestion is more common in the elderly, prisoners and people with underlying psychiatric disorders.(2) Acuphagia is a form of pica, the consumption of non-nutritious substances. This patient had many psychiatric diagnoses. Most foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract spontaneously. Some require intervention. European guidelines recommend conservative management for asymptomatic patients with ingestion of small, blunt objects (except batteries and magnets)(3). Indications for endoscopy include symptomatic patients, ingestion of sharp or pointed materials, batteries, magnets and large substances. Those with complications, for example perforation, intestinal obstruction require surgery. Our patient required multiple upper gastrointestinal endoscopies. Although largely asymptomatic, she mainly ingested sharp metal objects that put her at a risk for perforation.Managing this patient was challenging due to multiple presentations. Medication readjustments to manage anxiety thereby preventing recurrences were not fully successful. The threshold for endoscopy was raised. Propofol is being avoided for endoscopy as much as possible as this was the specific agent she craved.},

  abstract = {Publication bias refers to a systematic deviation from the truth in the results of a meta-analysis due to the higher likelihood for published studies to be included in meta-analyses than unpublished studies. Publication bias can lead to misleading recommendations for decision and policy making. In this education review, we introduce, explain, and provide solutions to the pervasive misuses and misinterpretations of publication bias that afflict evidence syntheses in sport and exercise medicine, with a focus on the commonly used funnel-plot based methods. Publication bias is more routinely assessed by visually inspecting funnel plot asymmetry, although it has been consistently deemed unreliable, leading to the development of statistical tests to assess publication bias. However, most statistical tests of publication bias (i) cannot rule out alternative explanations for funnel plot asymmetry (e.g., between-study heterogeneity, choice of metric, chance) and (ii) are grossly underpowered, even when using an arbitrary minimum threshold of ten or more studies. We performed a cross-sectional meta-research investigation of how publication bias was assessed in systematic reviews with meta-analyses published in the top two sport and exercise medicine journals throughout 2021. This analysis highlights that publication bias is frequently misused and misinterpreted, even in top tier journals. Because of conceptual and methodological problems when assessing and interpreting publication bias, preventive strategies (e.g., pre-registration, registered reports, disclosing protocol deviations, and reporting all study findings regardless of direction or magnitude) offer the best and most efficient solution to mitigate the misuse and misinterpretation of publication bias. Because true publication bias is very difficult to determine, we recommend that future publications use the term ``risk of publication bias''.},

Daily recommended zinc intake differs depending on the patient population, and the normal concentration of zinc in serum is 109 to 130 micrograms/deciliter. It acts as a cofactor in enzymatic reactions involved in DNA expression, membrane stabilization, vitamin A metabolism, and the gustatory and olfactory systems. These functions also contribute to zinc's importance during fetal growth and development. Additionally, a feature of zinc's function in the body is its inverse relationship to copper levels, and~it is~frequently part of the pharmaceutical preparations used in the treatment of Wilson disease. Chronic zinc toxicity manifests primarily as copper deficiency.~Exposure and toxicity are not uncommon because there are many sources of zinc throughout the environment. There are case reports of toxicity as a result of inhalation from occupational sources, overuse of dietary supplements, use of denture cream, ingestion of pennies secondary to PICA, and erroneously prepared total parenteral nutrition, to name a few. Some of these cases did have fatal outcomes.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Recognition of some of the limitations of titanium plates and screws used for the fixation of bones has led to the development of plates manufactured from bioresorbable materials. Whilst resorbable plates appear to offer clinical advantages over metal plates in orthognathic surgery, concerns remain about the stability of fixation and the length of time required for their degradation and the possibility of foreign body reactions. This review compares the use of titanium versus bioresorbable plates in orthognathic surgery and is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2007. Objectives To compare the effects of bioresorbable fixation systems with titanium systems used during orthognathic surgery. Search methods Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 20 January 2017); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 11) in the Cochrane Library (searched 20 January 2017); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 20 January 2017); and Embase Ovid (1980 to 20 January 2017). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov ( clinicaltrials.gov ; searched 20 January 2017), and the  World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform  (searched 20 January 2017) for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing bioresorbable versus titanium fixation systems used for orthognathic surgery in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the results of the electronic searches, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We resolved disagreement by discussion. Clinical heterogeneity between the included trials precluded pooling of data, and only a descriptive summary is presented. Main results This review included two trials, involving 103 participants, one comparing titanium with resorbable plates and screws and the other titanium with resorbable screws. Both studies were at high risk of bias and provided very limited data for the primary outcomes of this review. All participants in one trial suffered mild to moderate postoperative discomfort with no statistically significant difference between the two plating groups at different follow-up times. Mean scores of patient satisfaction were 7.43 to 8.63 (range 0 to 10) with no statistically significant difference between the two groups throughout follow-up. Adverse effects reported in one study were two plate exposures in each group occurring between the third and ninth months. Plate exposures occurred mainly in the posterior maxillary region, except for one titanium plate exposure in the mandibular premolar region. Known causes of infection were associated with loosened screws and wound dehiscence with no statistically significant difference in the infection rate between titanium (3/196), and resorbable (3/165) plates. Authors' conclusions We do not have sufficient evidence to determine if titanium plates or resorbable plates are superior for fixation of bones after orthognathic surgery. This review provides insufficient evidence to show any difference in postoperative pain and discomfort, level of patient satisfaction, plate exposure or infection for plate and screw fixation using either titanium or resorbable materials. Plain language summary Resorbable versus titanium plates for corrective jaw surgery Review question Are resorbable (biodegradable) plates better than titanium (metal) plates for the fixation of facial bones after corrective (orthognathic) jaw surgery? Background Under- or overgrowth of one or both of the jaw bones can lead to reduced function and an unattractive facial appearance, either of which may have lasting and significant psychosocial effects. Treatment of severe cases may require a combination of orthodontic appliances and orthognathic (corrective jaw) surgery. After surgery the cut bone needs to be immobilised to ensure that optimal healing takes place. Titanium plates used for fixation are recognised to be the 'gold standard' but recent developments in biomaterials have led to an increased use of bioresorbable plates or screws for corrective jaw surgery. The use of bioresorbable plates for the fixation of facial bones might appear to reduce the need for a further operation for the removal of metal plates. However, whilst resorbable plates do appear to offer certain advantages over metal plates, concerns remain about the stability of fixation, the length of time required for their resorption (being reabsorbed), the possibility of foreign body reactions, and with some of the technical difficulties experienced with resorbable plates. Study characteristics We included two studies that analysed a total of 103 participants. The evidence in this review is up to date as of 20 January 2017. Study participants were adults older than 16 years of age. One study compared titanium with resorbable plates and screws and the other titanium with resorbable screws. One study was conducted in China, the other in Germany. Key results Both studies were at high risk of bias and provided very limited data. We do not have sufficient evidence to determine if titanium plates or resorbable plates are superior for the fixation of bones after corrective jaw surgery. This review provides insufficient evidence to show any difference in postoperative pain and discomfort, level of patient satisfaction, plate exposure or infection for plate and screw fixation using either titanium or resorbable materials. Quality of the evidence Both included studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias and the very limited and weak evidence was of very low quality.},

  abstract = {Background: Echographic examination of the lung surface may reveal multiple ``comet-tail images'' originating from water-thickened interlobular septa. These images could be useful for noninvasive assessment of interstitial pulmonary edema. Study objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of lung comet-tail images compared with chest radiography, wedge pressure, and extravascular lung water (EVLW) quantified by the indicator dilution method (PiCCO System, version 4.1; Pulsion Medical Systems; Munich, Germany). Methods and patients: We enrolled 20 patients (mean age, 62.6 ؎ 11.5 years [؎ SD]). Patients were studied before, immediately after, and 24 h following cardiac surgery with chest ultrasound, chest radiography, pulmonary artery catheterization, and the PiCCO system. Performing echo scanning (right and left hemithorax, from second to fourth intercostal space, from parasternal to midaxillary line), an individual patient comet score was obtained by summing the number of comets in each scanned space. Results: A total of 60 comparisons were obtained. Significant positive linear correlations were found between comet score and EVLW determined by the PiCCO System (r ؍ 0.42, p ؍ 0.001), between comet score and wedge pressure (r ؍ 0.48, p ؍ 0.01), and between comet score and radiologic lung water score (r ؍ 0.60, p ؍ 0.0001). Conclusions: The presence and the number of comet-tail images provide reliable information on interstitial pulmonary edema. Therefore, ultrasonography represent an attractive, easy-to-use, bedside diagnostic tool for assessing cardiac function and pulmonary congestion.},

Factors influencing morbidity and mortality among studied  patients will be deliberated as well. METHODS: It is a hospital-based descriptive  study where all children between birth and 16 years of age who were admitted to  Sohag University Hospital, Egypt from January 1st, 2018, to December 31st, 2020,  for FBs removal were analyzed. All cases were subjected to complete history  taking, physical, radiological, and bronchoscopic examination. RESULTS: A total  of fourteen [14] patients were presented with FBI based on a full history,  examination, and essential investigation. The vast majority 92.9\% of presented  cases (13 out of 14) were less than 6 years old. 50\% of them (50\%) (7 out of 14)  were less than one year old. Most cases presented early within a few hours after  ingestion (71.4\%). Two [2] patients had predisposing conditions like mental  retardation and cerebral palsy. 28.6\% of cases presented late ({$>$}\,24~h after  aspiration). Except for one case where a cervical oesophageal approach was  needed. Endoscopic extractions of foreign bodies were successfully done. 50\% of  patients required admissions to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). The  mortality rate was 14.3\%. CONCLUSION: FBI is a common clinical emergency in  children younger than 6 years. A high index of suspicion is the keystone for  diagnosis. Early detection and management are crucial for a positive outcome.},

  abstract = {Self-\-harm within immigration detention centres has been a widely documented phenomenon, occurring at far higher rates than the wider community. Evidence suggests that factors such as the conditions of detention and uncertainty about refugee status are among the most prominent precipitators of self-\-harm. While important in explaining self-h\- arm, this is not the entire story. In this paper, we argue for a more overtly political interpretation of detainee self-\-harm as resistance and assess the ethical implications of this view, drawing on interviews with detainees from Australia's offshore system. Self-\-harm by detainees is not only a medical 'condition' arising in response to oppression but a form of political action to lessen or contest it. We first establish how self-\-harm could be conceptualised as resistance. We then discuss its political purpose, noting it serves at least three functions: intrinsic, instrumental and disruptive or coercive. Viewing detainee self-\- harm as political resistance is a supplement to (rather than a substitute for) a medical approach. However, conceptualising self-\-harm this way has several advantages, namely, moving away from the idea that such behaviour is 'maladaptive', recognising detainees as political agents, combatting government claims of 'manipulation' and 'blackmail' and clarifying the duties of healthcare workers who work in detention.},

  abstract = {Background: The Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score is widely used in research and quality assurance to assess neurologic outcome following cardiac arrest. However, little is known about the inter- and intra-reviewer reliability of the CPC. Methods: We undertook an investigation to assess the inter-reviewer and source document reliability of the CPC among a cohort of survivors from out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest (n = 131) in a large metropolitan area between November 1, 2003 and December 31, 2005. Subjects with a CPC of 1 or 2 were classified as favorable outcome and those with CPC 3 or greater were classified as unfavorable outcome. One abstractor first used the discharge summary alone to determine the CPC. All 3 abstractors independently reviewed the entire hospital record. Reliability was assessed by determining the proportion of determinations that agreed between abstractors and the respective kappa statistics. We also evaluated the implications for determining survival with favorable neurological outcome when survival to hospital discharge was 20\% and 30\%. Results: When the entire hospital record was used to determine CPC, favorable neurologic outcome (CPC 1 or 2) was recorded in 92\% by abstractor 1, 89\% by abstractor 2, and 74\% by abstractor 3. Agreement was 96\% (kappa = 0.78) between abstractors 1 and 2, 84\% (kappa = 0.49) between abstractors 2 and 3, 82\% (kappa = 0.38) between abstractors 1 and 3. The 3-way kappa was 0.50. Agreement was 90\% (kappa = 0.71) between the discharge summary alone and the entire hospital record. If the results from review of the entire record are applied to a circumstance where survival to discharge is 20\%, favorable neurologic status would occur in 18.4\% for abstractor 1, 17.8\% for abstractor 2, and 14.8\% for abstractor 3. For survival to hospital discharge of 30\%, favorable neurologic status would occur in 27.6\% for abstractor 1, 26.7\% for abstractor 2, and 22.2\% for abstractor 3. Conclusions: In this cohort study of survivors of out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest, the use of the CPC to classify favorable versus unfavorable neurological status at hospital discharge produced variable inter- and intra-reviewer agreement. The findings provide useful context to interpret outcome evaluations that report CPC.},

One mL of a cultured sample of abscessconcentration MSSA was used to inoculate the specimen. A linear transducer was cleansed with a sterilizing cloth and the end of the probe was then covered with a Tegaderm (3M, Maplewood, MN). One of three conduction media was applied to the pork shoulder: sterile saline, chlorhexidine, or sterile gel. The probe was then used to perform a soft tissue scan of the pork shoulder for one minute. After this, the probe was swabbed and cultured to detect transmission of MSSA. This was done four times for each of the three media types. Results: None of the four saline or four chlorhexidine probe swabs grew MSSA when cultured. Three of the four sterile gel probe swabs grew MSSA. Conclusions: These results suggest that sterile ultrasound gel may be more likely to transmit skin pathogens to the probe during POCUS in a simulated environment. However, larger studies and further exploration into this topic are necessary to draw clinical conclusions.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to perform a comparative analysis of the examination and treatment outcomes of children with cylindrical and button  batteries (BB) ingestion depending on their size and anatomical locations.  METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of 124 children aged from  1~month to 18~years who ingested batteries and were treated in a tertiary care  center from January 1, 2014 to March 31, 2019. The data studied included age,  sex, presenting symptoms at the time of evaluation, type and size of battery and  modality of management. RESULTS: Twenty-three (18.5\%) patients ingested  cylindrical batteries (CBs), and 101 (81.5\%) ingested BBs. The duration of  hospital stay was significantly longer (p\,=\,0.004) in the group of children who  ingested BBs larger than 20~mm. Endoscopic removal was performed in 75 (60.5\%)  children, 46 (37.1\%) were followed up and three (2.4\%) underwent open surgeries.  Children with CBs ingestion, in 55\% of cases, had gastric mucosal injuries.  Children with BBs impacted in the esophagus in 96\% cases had visible severe  mucosal damage, whereas patients with gastric BB ingestion 19.5\% had superficial  gastric mucosal damage. CONCLUSION: Performing timely endoscopic retrieval in  children who are admitted early to the hospital will reduce the risk of damage to  the gastrointestinal mucosa, especially in the stomach. Unlike BBs, CBs, despite  their large size, have advantageous shapes, uneventfully pass the esophagus and  are more often retained in the stomach; thus, mucosal injuries are more often  observed in the stomach. Consequently, endoscopic extraction is the treatment of  choice for children with BB ingestion.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The diagnostic accuracy of the FAST exam performed by EM residents were shown to be similar to radiology residents. However, in the last 2 decades, an extended-FAST (E-FAST) protocol including thoracic examination to exclude pneumo- and hemothorax was introduced. The accuracy of emergency physicians (EPs) while performing E-FAST is a less studied area, especially in Europe. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the E-FAST exam performed by EM residents with the results of CT scan as a gold standard. Methods: This was a prospective, observational, diagnostic accuracy study conducted at the ED of a Level 1 Trauma Center. All consecutive adult multiple trauma patients were eligible, and any patient in whom thoraco-abdominal CT was ordered were recruited. Unstable and unavailable patients were excluded. E-FAST examination was performed by EPs as the index test, and CT examinations reported by a blinded academic radiology faculty was the gold standard. Results: A total of 140 patients were recruited from eligible 144 patients. The final study population was 132 for abdominal and 130 for thorax examinations. In this study, AUC of E-FAST was 0.71 for abdominal free fluid, 0.87 for pneumothorax and 1.00 for pleural effusion. The sensitivity was 42.9\% and specificity was 98.4\%. The +LR for abdominal free fluid was 26.8 and -LR was 0.58. Conclusion: E-FAST examination has an excellent specificity. However, the sensitivity of the test is not high enough to rule-out thoraco-abdominal injuries in trauma patients when performed by EPs. {\copyright} 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The swallowing of foreign bodies can be accidental or intentional. The majority of the cases of accidental foreign body ingestion are observed in children. In adults, foreign body ingestion can be accidental, related to specific pathological changes of the digestive tract, or deliberate, as observed in patients with psychiatric diseases or in those released from the prison. CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with symptoms including choking, drooling from the mouth, holding his neck, and aphonia. He had a history of psychiatric illness with suicidal ingestion of a foreign body. After stabilization, he was sent for chest radiograph, which revealed a significant radiopaque shadow the shape of a spanner, occupying the whole length of the esophagus. Emergency rigid esophagoscopy was performed to save the patient's life. DISCUSSION: The patient swallowed the largest hard foreign body to harm himself or his family, to get the attention of his family, or as a suicide attempt. Such patients require urgent intervention by rigid esophagoscopy to reduce the risk of complications and to save the patients' lives. Further follow-up is essential due to the possibility of repeated foreign body ingestion. CONCLUSION: While taking care of psychiatric patients, close observation by family members is mandatory to prevent them from harming themselves and to prevent suicide attempts by swallowing sharp, hard, large, and dangerous foreign bodies such as the size 17 wrench spanner observed in the present case.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A retrospective review was performed on 180 patients from 1975 to 1997 to evaluate the diagnosis, and management of esophageal foreign bodies. METHODS: All patients except two were symptomatic and 145 of them were younger than 14 years of age. Plain films were performed in every patient with a suspected esophageal foreign body (EFB). In all patients, rigid esophagoscopy was done under general anesthesia once the diagnosis of impacted EFB is made. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of the foreign bodies were coins. In children, the majority of impacted esophageal foreign bodies were located at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle while in adults the site of impaction was the lower esophageal sphincter. The most common symptoms were vomiting and or regurgitation. Of the 180 EFBs encountered, 169 were extracted endoscopically, five were pushed into the stomach, five were not found, and one patient needed cervicotomy. There were no deaths in this series. Predisposing factors were found in 15 patients. Fifteen patients (8.3\%) had benign strictures. In ten patients (5.5\%), minor complications were encountered, none of which were esophagoscopically related. Alternative diagnostic and therapeutic modalities are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: All patients with a history of suspected foreign body ingestion should have direct endoscopic examination. If the EFB is not detected a thorough radiographic examination, including CT scan, should be performed to detect a possible intra- or extraluminal object. Preservation of the airway is regarded to be the most important consideration in esophageal foreign body management.},

Ingestion of multiple  high-power magnet pieces is unique and increases the risk of morbidity and  mortality. The longer the duration of ingestion, the increased likelihood of  complications. Various management options have been reported, and there is no  consensus on the ideal management which necessitates the need for a practical  algorithm. The incidence of magnet ingestion has been increasing and directly  related to the laws and recalls. The aim of this review is to provide an easy and  practical pathway for management and to highlight the preventive rules of the  legislations and recalls. Methods: PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of  Systematic Reviews, and the list of references from all identified complete  publications were searched for all publications in English-language for pediatric  magnet ingestion. Conclusion: Practical and time-saving management pathways are  recommended to minimize the risk of complications. Preventive rules and recalls  are important for eliminating the availability of these hazardous magnets. Public  awareness about the unique risks posed by these magnets if ingested is important.},

  abstract = {Background: Foreign-body ingestion is a common event most often seen in children from 6 months to 6 years of age. In adults, foreign bodies are usually ingested accidentally together with food. This happens more commonly in persons with certain pathological changes of the gastrointestinal tract. Methods: We present a selective review of pertinent literature retrieved by a search in the PubMed database. Results: The foreign bodies most commonly ingested by adults are fish bones and chicken bones. The clinical approach to the problem depends on the type of material ingested and on the patient's symptoms and physical findings. In about 80\% of cases, the ingested material passes uneventfully through the gastrointestinal tract; endoscopy is performed in about 20\% of cases, and surgery in less than 1\%. Emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is recommended when the esophagus is completely occluded (because of the risk of aspiration and/or pressure necrosis), when the ingested object has a sharp point or edge (because of the risk of perforation, with ensuing mediastinitis or peritonitis), and when a battery has been ingested (because of the risk of necrosis and fistula formation). For non-occluding esophageal foreign bodies, including magnets, an urgent but non-emergency EGD within 12 to 24 hours is recommended. Conclusion: Most patients can be treated conservatively by observation alone, but there should be a low threshold for deciding to proceed to endoscopic retrieval. Surgery is reserved for complicated cases. ►Cite this as: Ambe P, Weber SA, Schauer M, Knoefel WT: Swallowed foreign bodies in adults. Dtsch Arztebl Int 2012; 109(50): 869-75.

Methods We searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature database, and Scopus up to 30 May 2024. Studies were included when they evaluated the unused peripheral intravenous catheters in the paediatric and adult populations in the pre-hospital setting, emergency area, and inpatient wards. The title-abstract and full-text screening were performed independently by two reviewers and the data extraction was conducted. Results Twenty-five studies were included. The majority were conducted in Australia and in the emergency setting. There are three main criteria adopted to define the unused short peripheral intravenous catheter, which are `Insertion/usage goals', `Time criteria' and `Patients' clinical conditions'. The prevalence varied from 8.4\% to 56\% across the settings. The factors affecting the risk of unused peripheral intravenous catheters are related to patients' characteristics, characteristics of peripheral intravenous catheters, and characteristics of professionals in the team. In conclusion, there is a high variability of the definition to indicate the unused peripheral intravenous catheters, of which occurrence emerged as spread on a large range. There is a need to standardise the phenomenon's definition and method of measurement, considering the predicting factors., No Patient or Public Contribution.},

This study aims to present the global prevalence of suicide between immigrants and refugees as well as to report the prevalence of suicide ideation, suicide mortality, suicide attempts, and plan of suicide. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA's) rules were used as a guide in the current research path. PubMed and EMBASE were targeted for the study until December 2019. After collecting the data, the number of events and sample size extracted for each study and also pooled odds ratio and confidence interval (CI) were used to investigate the suicide ratio among immigrants and refugees compared to the native population. Fifty-one studies were included in the meta-analysis to investigate suicide prevalence or suicide odds ratio. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 16\% (CI: 0.12--0.20, I2 = 99.4\%), for attempted suicide was 6\% (CI: 0.05--0.08, I2 = 98.0\%), and for suicide plan prevalence was 4\% (CI: 0.00--0.08, I2 = 96.8\%). The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 10\% (CI: 0.04--0.17, I2 = 0.0\%) in men and 17\% (CI: 0.10--0.24, I2 = 96.8\%) in women. The prevalence of attempted suicide was 1\% (CI: 0.01--0.02, I2 = 0.0\%) in men and 7\% (CI: 0.03--0.10, I2 = 94.4\%) in women. The odds ratio of suicide mortality among immigrants was 0.91 (CI: 0.90--0.93, p {$<$} 0.001; I2 = 97.6\%) and for attempted suicide was 1.15 (CI: 1.10--1.20, p {$<$} 0.001; I2 = 92.0\%). Begg's test (p = 0.933) (Egger test; p = 0.936) rejected publication bias.

In the hypothermia group, stage 2 treatments were added only if hypothermia failed to control intracranial pressure. In both groups, stage 3 treatments (barbiturates and decompressive craniectomy) were used if all stage 2 treatments failed to control intracranial pressure. The primary outcome was the score on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E; range, 1 to 8, with lower scores indicating a worse functional outcome) at 6 months. The treatment effect was estimated with ordinal logistic regression adjusted for prespecified prognostic factors and expressed as a common odds ratio (with an odds ratio {$<$}1.0 favoring hypothermia). RESULTS We enrolled 387 patients at 47 centers in 18 countries from November 2009 through October 2014, at which time recruitment was suspended owing to safety concerns. Stage 3 treatments were required to control intracranial pressure in 54\% of the patients in the control group and in 44\% of the patients in the hypothermia group. The adjusted common odds ratio for the GOS-E score was 1.53 (95\% confidence interval, 1.02 to 2.30; P\,=\,0.04), indicating a worse outcome in the hypothermia group than in the control group. A favorable outcome (GOS-E score of 5 to 8, indicating moderate disability or good recovery) occurred in 26\% of the patients in the hypothermia group and in 37\% of the patients in the control group (P\,=\,0.03).

In order to  study the behaviour of radionuclides in the human organism (metabolism,  retention, excretion), knowledge of radionuclide speciation is indispensable:  speciation governs the transfer, bioavailability and toxicity of elements and is  also of considerable interest for decorporation. In this context, the  Commissariat {\`a} l'Energie Atomique has created a working group on speciation to  share data both on thermodynamic constants and on speciation analysis methods of  interest to chemists, environmentalists and biologists. The initial focus was on  the 31 radionuclides described in different International Commission on  Radiological Protection models (HRTM, HAT) and the National Council on Radiation  Protection model (wound). Particular attention was devoted to selecting the  inorganic and organic ligands, most representative of biological media. The base  applied to speciation in solution and at interfaces and solubility (BASSIST)  thermodynamic database was developed for this purpose. The aim of this paper is  to present the state of the art on radionuclide speciation tools within  biological media and to emphasise some missing data in order to orient future  research.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Endoscopic foreign body retrieval in the upper gastrointestinal tract is well established, however indications for endoscopy for  retained foreign bodies in the lower gastrointestinal tract and specifically the  right colon is still being navigated [3]. A PubMed and Google Scholar search  discovered a variety of case reports detailing various methods and indications  for endoscopic retrieval of right sided colonic foreign bodies. This case report  endeavors to supplement the literature so that guidelines can one day be  established for colonoscopic retrieval of right-sided foreign bodies. CASE  PRESENTATION: 36-year-old male prisoner swallowed 6.5~cm nail clippers with a  long-standing history of intentional foreign body ingestion (FBI) including  multiple laparotomies for foreign body retrievals. Computerized tomography (CT)  was used initially to confirm the position of the nail clippers. After almost two  weeks of failure of the foreign body (FB) to move beyond the caecum as  demonstrated on plain abdominal X-rays, the patient had a colonoscopy with  successful retrieval of the FB. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: This case report hopes to  encourage the consideration of colonoscopy for retrieval of right sided colonic  foreign bodies that have failed to pass on their own and where an operation may  come with increased risk (multiple laparotomies, multiple comorbidities, and  higher anaesthetic risk for a general anaesthetic). Colonoscopy/endoscopy still  has inherent risk and this patient did have an episode of temporary laryngospasm  that required intubation and monitoring in the intensive care unit post  operatively. Despite this the patient recovered and was discharged day one post  procedure without further complication. The case report has been reported in line  with the SCARE 2020 criteria (Agha et al., 2020 [2]). CONCLUSION: Indications for  consideration of endoscopic retrieval of foreign bodies in the right colon have  not been entirely detailed as endoscopy is for upper gastrointestinal foreign  bodies. This case report documents the indications for endoscopy in the clinical  context of a recurrent FBI and a history of multiple laparotomies with failure of  the FB to move beyond the caecum.},

  abstract = {Background: A ban on neodymium magnets was lifted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission in 2016. Pediatric gastroenterologists and surgeons were  increasingly tasked with removing these problematic objects. The purpose of this  study was to assess the utility of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) in  the management of ingested magnets. Patients and Methods: This is a  single-center, retrospective assessment of surgical interventions for ingested  magnets. International Classification of Disease, 10th revision codes were used  to identify 349 patients {$\leq$}21 years of age evaluated for foreign body ingestion  over a 4.5-year period. A medical record review helped isolate 29 (8.3\%) magnet  ingestions, 9 requiring surgical intervention. RedCap was used for analysis.  Results: Of 9 surgical patients, 7 underwent SILS intervention by 1 surgeon.  Another surgeon performed an open operation, whereas a third performed a  multiport operation. Of the 7 SILS cases, 3 were completed without conversion to  open. In one of these cases, bowel resection with primary anastomosis was  performed. For SILS cases, average operating room time was 109 minutes (38-170  minutes), time to enteral feeds was 23 hours (0.28-79.2 hours), and hospital  length of stay (LOS) was 3.8 days (1.96-6.68 days). Thirty-day readmission for  SILS was 14.3\%. No other complications were observed. Conclusions: SILS has been  safely utilized for magnet retrieval. It offers an ability to identify the  affected intestinal segment and an opportunity to intervene extracorporeally  through an uncapped port. In addition, knowing where matted bowel is located can  direct a limited incision during conversion to laparotomy. This may confer  benefits of decreased pain, shortened time to enteral feeds, and decreased  hospital LOS.},

The sensitivity of physical examination alone to determine fluid status is limited, precluding accurate clinical decision making. Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) is emerging as a valuable, noninvasive, bedside diagnostic tool for objective evaluation of physiologic and hemodynamic parameters related to fluid status, tolerance, and responsiveness. Rapid bedside sonographic evaluation can obtain qualitative data on cardiac function and quantitative data on pulmonary congestion. Advanced POCUS, including goal-directed Doppler echocardiography, provides additional quantitative information, including flow velocities and pressures across the cardiac structures. Recently, abnormal Doppler flow patterns in abdominal organs secondary to increased right atrial pressure have been linked to congestive organ damage, adding another component to the hemodynamic assessment. Integrating POCUS findings with clinical and laboratory data can further elucidate a patient's hemodynamic status. This drives decisions regarding crystalloid administration or, conversely, diuresis or ultrafiltration and allows tailored therapy for individual patients. In this article, we provide an overview of the focused assessment of cardiovascular function and pulmonary and venous congestion using POCUS and review relevant literature.},

Data were documented according to Utstein Style. The risk factor was cumulative epinephrine categorized into quartiles. The endpoints were unfavourable functional outcome and inhospital mortality. Results: The median cumulative amount of epinephrine administered was 2 mg (IQR 0--5), ranging from 1 to 50 mg. Of all patients 643/946 (68\%) had an unfavourable functional outcome, 649/946 (69\%) died during hospital stay. The multivariable analysis showed a statistically significant increasing risk for unfavourable functional outcome and in-hospital mortality outcome with increasing cumulative doses of epinephrine (unfavourable functional outcome: OR 1--1.45--2.25--2.95 over quartiles of epinephrine; in hospital mortality: OR 1--1.35--2.15--2.82 over quartiles of epinephrine). Conclusion: Our results show that an increasing cumulative dose of epinephrine during resuscitation of patients with asystole and pulseless electric activity is an independent risk factor for unfavourable functional outcome and in-hospital mortality.},

  abstract = {Venous congestion, often associated with elevated right atrial pressure presents a clinical challenge due to its varied manifestations and potential organ damage. Recognizing the manifestations of venous congestion through bedside physical examination or laboratory tests can be challenging. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is emerging as a valuable bedside tool for assessing venous congestion, with the Venous Excess Ultrasound (VExUS) technique gaining prominence. VExUS facilitates non-invasive quantification of venous congestion, relying on measurements of the inferior vena cava (IVC) size and Doppler assessments of the hepatic vein (HV), portal vein (PV), and intrarenal vein, thereby providing real-time insights into hemodynamic status and guiding therapeutic interventions. The grading system outlined in VExUS aids in stratifying the severity of congestion. However, achieving proficiency in VExUS requires a comprehensive understanding of Doppler techniques and their clinical applications. This review article provides practical guidance on performing VExUS, encompassing equipment requirements, preparation, machine settings, and examination techniques for assessing the inferior vena cava (IVC), hepatic vein (HV), portal vein (PV), and intrarenal vein. Potential pitfalls and troubleshooting strategies are discussed to ensure accurate interpretation of Doppler waveforms.},

CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old man was admitted with massive upper  gastrointestinal bleeding 10 days after swallowing a fish bone. Computed  tomography demonstrated a fistula from the proximal descending thoracic aorta to  the mid esophagus. The bleeding was initially controlled by inflating a  Sengstaken-Blakemore tube. A 28-mm x 16-cm Talent stent-graft was delivered  transfemorally to repair the aortic defect; the esophageal injury was repaired  primarily using a pedicled intercostal muscle flap via a right thoracotomy. Chest  radiography at 12 months showed no migration of the stent-graft. Blood parameters  of infection were normal; the patient remains well 18 months after stent-graft  implantation. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates stent-graft treatment of a  life-threatening hemorrhage from an aortoesophageal fistula.},

Her only symptom was abdominal cramping. On examination, her vital signs were stable and she appeared to be in no acute distress. On examination, she had multiple old self-inflicted scars on her arms, wrists and thighs. She admitted that she had swallowed ten razor blades after coating them with chewing gum but she denied any intentions to hurt herself. Vitals were stable and her physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory work up was within normal with stable hemoglobin and hemarocrit. Acute abdominal X-ray showed razor blades overlying the upper abdomen, likely in the gastric antrum (Figure 1). Four days later, repeated X-rays showed multiple razor blades present in the rectum (Figure 2). Eventually, all razor blades were passed. Psychiatry was consulted for management of schizoaffective schizophrenia and she was restarted on her home medications. She was discharged in a stable condition.},

Particularly, emergency treatment is required for cutting and drilling bodies. The majority of ingested foreign bodies (80-90\%) leave gastrointestinal tract without creating problems. In 10-20\% of cases, intervention is absolutely required. Less than 1\% of cases need surgery. In this paper, we present a schizophrenia patient who swallowed multiple lighters. Case. A 21-year-old male schizophrenic patient who uses psychotic drugs presented to the emergency department with the complaints of abdominal pain, severe vomiting, and inability to swallow for a week. His physical examination revealed epigastric tenderness. A plain radiograph of the abdomen revealed multiple tiny metallic densities. Gastroscopy was performed. The lighters were not allowing the passage, and some of them had penetrated the gastric mucosa, and bezoars were observed. One lighter was extracted with the help of the polypectomy snare. Other lighters as a bezoar were removed by surgery. Conclusion. Excessive vomiting of swallowed foreign bodies in the etiology of psychotic patients should be kept in mind. Endoscopic therapy can be performed in the early stages in these patients, but in the late stage surgery is inevitable.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A retrospective study was conducted in 400 patients with esophageal foreign bodies (EFB) to assess characteristics of EFB and methods of treatment. METHODS: From 1962 through 1998, 400 patients with EFB were treated in our department on an emergency basis. There were 202 men (50\%) and 198 women (49.6\%) ranging in age from 1.5 to 95 years. The main symptoms patients complained of were difficulty in swallowing and pain. Detailed anamnesis, oropharynx and hypopharynx examination and finally radiological examination were the diagnostic tools. The location of the FB was in the cervical esophagus in 57\% of cases, in the thoracic one in 26\% and at the cardioesophageal junction in 17\%. The most common objects found were bones, morsels, coins and needles. RESULTS: The treatment consisted of rigid esophagoscopy under general anesthesia in 343 (85.7\%) of our cases. In 57 cases (14.3\%) other means such as flexible esophagoscopy, Fogarty or Foley catheters and bougienage turned to be very useful. Only 12 patients (3\%) were led to surgery because either extraction was impossible or perforation was present. No major complications occurred in the surgical group, whereas in the group of rigid esophagoscopy, there was one iatrogenous esophageal perforation that presented with empyema thoracis successfully treated. Finally, there was a case of an aortoesophageal fistula with mortal outcome perioperatively. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Esophagoscopy is a reliable method in the treatment of EFB impaction. (2) Alternative methods such as bougienage, etc., can be used only in selected cases with smooth foreign bodies. (3) Surgical treatment is unavoidable in cases of irretrievable EFB or esophageal perforation.},

TBI diagnosis and management rely on patient-reported symptoms and subjective clinical assessment. There are no biologic tools to detect mild TBI or to track brain recovery. Emerging evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) may provide information about the injured brain. These tiny epigenetic molecules are expressed throughout the body. However, they are particularly important in neurons, can cross the blood-brain barrier, and are securely transported from cell to cell, where they regulate gene expression. miRNA levels may identify patients with TBI and predict symptom duration. This review synthesizes miRNA findings from 14 human studies. We distill more than 291 miRNAs to 17 biomarker candidates that overlap across multiple studies and multiple biofluids. The goal of this review is to establish a collective understanding of miRNA biology in TBI and identify clinical priorities for future investigations of this promising biomarker.},

Methods: The protocol consists of six windows including cardiac, peritoneal, pleural, inferior vena cava and aortic views, and aims to shorten the time period taken to establish a diagnosis and hence to deliver the most appropriate goal-directed therapy. Its use in seven case examples is described. Results: In all cases the ACES protocol helped in guiding the initial management while further information was obtained. Conclusion: The six-view ACES protocol is a useful adjunct to clinical examination in patients with undifferentiated hypotension in the emergency department. A prospective randomised trial or multicentre database/ registry is needed to investigate the validity and impact of this protocol on the early diagnosis and management of hypotensive patients.},

  abstract = {Methods: This international, multicenter, randomized controlled trial recruited from 6 centers in North America and South Africa and included selected hypotensive patients (systolic blood pressure {$<$}100 mm Hg or shock index {$>$}1) randomized to early point-of-care ultrasonography plus standard care versus standard care without point-of-care ultrasonography. Diagnoses were recorded at 0 and 60 minutes. The primary outcome measure was survival to 30 days or hospital discharge. Secondary outcome measures included initial treatment and investigations, admissions, and length of stay. Results: Follow-up was completed for 270 of 273 patients. The most common diagnosis in more than half the patients was occult sepsis. We found no important differences between groups for the primary outcome of survival (point-of-care ultrasonography group 104 of 136 patients versus standard care 102 of 134 patients; difference 0.35\%; 95\% binomial confidence interval [CI] --10.2\% to 11.0\%), survival in North America (point-of-care ultrasonography group 76 of 89 patients versus standard care 72 of 88 patients; difference 3.6\%; CI --8.1\% to 15.3\%), and survival in South Africa (point-of-care ultrasonography group 28 of 47 patients versus standard care 30 of 46 patients; difference 5.6\%; CI --15.2\% to 26.0\%). There were no important differences in rates of computed tomography (CT) scanning, inotrope or intravenous fluid use, and ICU or total length of stay. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial to compare point-of-care ultrasonography to standard care without point-of-care ultrasonography in undifferentiated hypotensive ED patients. We did not find any benefits for survival, length of stay, rates of CT scanning, inotrope use, or fluid administration. The addition of a point-ofcare ultrasonography protocol to standard care may not translate into a survival benefit in this group. [Ann Emerg Med. 2018;-:1-12.]},

The respiratory response after head injury remains poorly defined, however, and its contribution to hypoxic or ischemic mechanisms after severe head injury is unknown. METHODS: Eighteen anesthetized but spontaneously breathing rats were subjected to fluid percussion head injury of varying severities. Respiratory rate and volume of air were recorded before and after injury with a Hans Rudolph/Varadyne pneumotach differential pressure transducer and graphically measured. Postmortem inspection of the brains was performed. RESULTS: Apnea and subsequent respiratory dysfunction are directly proportional to the magnitude of energy delivered to the brain. Higher energy results in a dysfunctional or absent respiratory response, probably attributable to failure or disorganized function of the medullary respiratory center. CONCLUSION: This study for the first time graphically depicts the respiratory response after head injury. Higher energy delivered to the brain directly correlates with a markedly abnormal respiratory response that probably contributes significantly to subsequent hypoxic or ischemic brain injury. The absence of the space-occupying hematoma or gross parenchymal disruption suggests that in the clinical setting many of these patients may otherwise have survivable head injury if rescued by early ventilatory assistance.},

Patients were divided into two groups based on adoption of national  guidelines: pre-guideline (2010-2015) and post-guideline (2016-2020). RESULTS:  Sixty-five patients were studied (pre-guideline n\,=\,23; post-guideline n\,=\,42).  Compared with pre-guideline, post-guideline use of magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) increased (2/23 [8.7\%]; 30/42 [71.4\%]; p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Post-guideline increases  resulted for median days (IQR) receiving antibiotics (0 [0, 4]; 6 [3, 8];  p\,=\,0.01), total pediatric intensive care unit admission (0 [0, 1]; 3 [0, 6];  p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and total hospital length of stay (5 [2, 11]; 11.5 [4, 17];  p\,=\,0.02). Two patients in the post-guideline group had delayed presentations  despite normal imaging: one with TEF and one with aorto-esophageal fistula. All  survived to discharge. CONCLUSION: In EBBI cases managed using the consensus  based NASPHAGN guidelines, we report increased resource utilization without  improved patient outcomes. Further research should evaluate post-guideline costs  and resource utilization.},

Study Selection:               Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared the current standard dose of epinephrine to placebo, high or low dose epinephrine, any other vasopressor alone or in combination were screened by three independent reviewers.                                         Data Extraction:               Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared the current standard dose of epinephrine to placebo, high or low dose epinephrine, any other vasopressor alone or in combination were screened by three independent reviewers.                                         Data Synthesis:               A total of 17 trials (21,510 patients) were included; seven were judged to be at high risk of bias. Compared to placebo, pooled results from two trials showed that standard dose of epinephrine increased return of spontaneous circulation (risk ratio, 3.09; 95\% CI, 2.82--3.89), survival to hospital admission (risk ratio, 2.50; 95\% CI, 1.68--3.72), and survival to discharge (risk ratio, 1.44; 95\% CI, 1.11--1.86). The largest placebo-controlled trial showed that standard dose of epinephrine also improved survival at 30 days and 3 months but not neurologic outcomes, standard dose of epinephrine decreased return of spontaneous circulation (risk ratio, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.77--0.98) and survival to admission (risk ratio, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.78--0.99) when compared with high dose epinephrine. There were no differences in outcomes between standard dose of epinephrine and vasopressin alone or in combination with epinephrine.                                         Conclusions:               Largely based on one randomized controlled trial, standard dose of epinephrine improved overall survival but not neurologic outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients compared with placebo. There is a paucity of trials with meaningful patient outcomes; future epinephrine trials should evaluate dose and method of delivery on long-term survival, neurologic function, and quality of life after cardiac arrest.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Manual pulse checks (MP) are an unreliable skill even in the hands of healthcare providers (HCPs). In the context of cardiac arrest, this may translate into inappropriate chest compressions when a pulse is present, or conversely omitting chest compressions when one is absent. To date, no study has assessed the use of B-mode ultrasound (US) for the detection of a carotid pulse. The primary objective of this study was to assess the time required to detect a carotid pulse in live subjects using US compared to the traditional palpation method. METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled crossover non-inferiority trial. HCPs attended a 15\,minute focused US workshop on identification of the carotid pulse. Both pulse check methods were timed for each participant on two different subjects in random order. The primary outcome was time to carotid pulse detection in seconds (s). Secondary outcomes included confidence levels of pulse detection measured on a 100\,mm visual analog scale (VAS) and rates of prolonged pulse checks ({$>$} 5\,s or {$>$}10\,s). The study was powered to determine whether US pulse checks were not slower than MP by greater than two seconds. The results are presented as the difference in means with a 90\% two-sided confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: 111 participants completed the study. Mean pulse detection times were 4.22\,s (SD 3.26) by US compared to 4.71\,s (SD 6.45) by MP with a mean difference in times of -0.49\,s (90\% CI: -1.77 to 0.39). There were no significant differences between US and MP in the rates of prolonged pulse checks of greater than 5\,s (23\% vs 19\%, p\,=\,0.45) or 10\,s (9\% vs 8\%, p\,=\,0.81). First attempt at detection of pulse checks was more successful in the US group (99.1\% vs 85.6\%, p\,=\,0.0001). Prior to training, participants reported higher confidence using MP compared to US; 68 (IQR 48-83) vs 15 (IQR 8-42) mm (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Following the study, participants reported higher confidence levels using US than MP; 91 (IQR 82-97) vs 83 (IQR 72-94)\,mm (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Carotid pulse detection in live subjects was not slower using US as compared to palpation, and demonstrated higher first attempt success rate and less variability in measurement times. A brief teaching session was sufficient to improve confidence of carotid pulse identification even in those with no previous US training. The preliminary results from this study provide the groundwork for larger studies to evaluate this pulse check method for patients in cardiac arrest.},

  abstract = {Background: The scientific evidence of a beneficial effect of ALS in pre-hospital treatment in trauma patients or patients with any acute illness is scarce. The objective of this systematic review of controlled studies was to examine whether ALS, as opposed to BLS, increases patient survival in pre-hospital treatment and if so, to identify the patient groups that gain benefit. Methods: A systematic review of studies published in the databases Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Scopus up to July 31st, 2010. Controlled studies comparing survival after the pre-hospital ALS treatment versus BLS treatment in trauma patients or patients with cardiac arrest were included. Results: We identified 1081 studies of which 18 met our inclusion criteria. In nine of 18 studies including 16,857 trauma patients in the intervention group, ALS care did not increase survival compared to BLS treatment (pooled OR 0.892, 95\% CI, 0.775--1.026). In nine of 18 studies including 7659 patients with cardiac arrest in the intervention group, ALS care increased survival compared to BLS treatment (OR 1.468, 95\% CI, 1.257--1.715). Most subgroup analyses revealed no significant interactions, but data from six trials, where ALS was provided by physicians, increases the probability of survival at hospital discharge even more (OR 2.047, 95\% CI 1.593--2.631). Conclusion: Implementation of ALS care to non-traumatic cardiac arrest patients can increase survival and further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of the effect. On the contrary, in trauma patients our meta-analysis revealed that ALS care is not associated with increased survival. However, only few controlled studies of sufficient quality and strength examining survival with prehospital ALS treatment exist.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Currently, the treatment of patients with shock is focused on the clinical symptoms of shock. In the early phase, this is usually limited to heart rate, blood pressure, lactate levels and urine output. However, as the ultimate goal of resuscitation is the improvement in microcirculatory perfusion the question is whether these currently used signs of shock and the improvement in these signs actually correspond to the changes in the microcirculation. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shown that during the development of shock the deterioration in the macrocirculatory parameters are followed by the deterioration of microcirculatory perfusion. However, in many cases the restoration of adequate macrocirculatory parameters is frequently not associated with improvement in microcirculatory perfusion. This relates not only to the cause of shock, where there are some differences between different forms of shock, but also to the type of treatment. SUMMARY: The improvement in macrohemodynamics during the resuscitation is not consistently followed by subsequent changes in the microcirculation. This may result in both over-resuscitation and under-resuscitation leading to increased morbidity and mortality. In this article the principles of coherence and the monitoring of the microcirculation are reviewed.},

Results:{\enspace} Of 396 patients in the intention to treat analysis, 201 were allocated to VHA and 195 to CCT-guided therapy. At 24 h, there was no difference in the proportion of patients who were alive and free of massive transfusion (VHA: 67\%, CCT: 64\%, OR 1.15, 95\% CI 0.76--1.73). 28-day mortality was not different overall (VHA: 25\%, CCT: 28\%, OR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.54--1.31), nor were there differences in other secondary outcomes or serious adverse events.

  abstract = {Most cases of serotonin toxicity are provoked by therapeutic doses of a combination of two or more serotonergic drugs, defined as drugs affecting the serotonin neurotransmitter system. Common serotonergic drugs include many antidepressants, antipsychotics, and opioid analgesics, particularly fentanyl, tramadol, meperidine (pethidine), and methadone, but rarely morphine and other related phenanthrenes. Symptoms of serotonin toxicity are attributable to an effect on monoaminergic transmission caused by an increased synaptic concentration of serotonin. The serotonin transporter (SERT) maintains low serotonin concentrations and is important for the reuptake of the neurotransmitter into the presynaptic nerve terminals. Some opioids inhibit the reuptake of serotonin by inhibiting SERT, thus increasing the plasma and synaptic cleft serotonin concentrations that activate the serotonin receptors. Opioids that are good inhibitors of SERT (tramadol, dextromethorphan, methadone, and meperidine) are most frequently associated with serotonin toxicity. Tramadol also has a direct serotonin-releasing action. Fentanyl produces an efflux of serotonin, and binds to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A and 5-HT2A receptors, whilst methadone, meperidine, and more weakly tapentadol, bind to 5-HT2A but not 5-HT1A receptors. The perioperative period is a time where opioids and other serotonergic drugs are frequently administered in rapid succession, sometimes to patients with other serotonergic drugs in their system. This makes the perioperative period a relatively risky time for serotonin toxicity to occur. The intraoperative recognition of serotonin toxicity is challenging as it can mimic other serious syndromes, such as malignant hyperthermia, sepsis, thyroid storm, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Anaesthetists must maintain a heightened awareness of its possible occurrence and a readiness to engage in early treatment to avoid poor outcomes.},

  abstract = {Deliberate foreign body ingestion (DFBI) is a rare psychopathological disorder that involves the swallowing of non-nutritive objects to cause self-harm. It is  most commonly associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Very scant  literature has been published on the psychopathological understanding or  psychopharmacological interventions. Mostly, gastroenterological and surgical  management~regarding the removal of the foreign body has been discussed in the  literature. DFBI can be very challenging in terms of the treatment of the patient  and the morale of the health providers - it exhausts the patient and the family  and evokes frustration among the medical staff due to its resistance to  remission. By presenting the case of a patient in this article, we will discuss  what is known about the poorly understood DFBI and the challenges and  difficulties encountered while treating these patients. Further, we will discuss  how a biopsychosocial approach can be used in treating these patients.},

  abstract = {Background and aims In-hospital fall-related injuries are a source of personal harm, preventable hospitalisation costs, and access block through increased length of stay. Despite increased fall prevention awareness and activity over the last decade, rates of reported fall-related fractures in hospitals appear not to have decreased. This cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to determine the efficacy of the 6-PACK programme for preventing fall-related injuries, and its generalisability to other acute hospitals. Methods 24 acute medical and surgical wards from six to eight hospitals throughout Australia will be recruited for the study. Wards will be matched by type and fall-related injury rates, then randomly allocated to the 6-PACK intervention (12 wards) or usual care control group (12 wards). The 6-PACK programme includes a nine-item fall risk assessment and six nursing interventions: `falls alert' sign; supervision of patients in the bathroom; ensuring patient's walking aids are within reach; establishment of a toileting regime; use of a low-low bed; and use of bed/chair alarm. Intervention wards will be supported by a structured implementation strategy. The primary outcomes are fall and fall-related injury rates 12 months following 6-PACK implementation. Discussion This study will involve approximately 16 000 patients, and as such is planned to be the largest hospital fall prevention RCT to be undertaken and the first to be powered for the important outcome of fall-related injuries. If effective, there is potential to implement the programme widely as part of daily patient care in acute hospital wards where fall-related injuries are a problem. Trial registration The protocol for this study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12611000332921).},

We excluded 73 subjects in whom no chest imaging had been performed within 5 days of thoracentesis or who had pre-existing chronic hydropneumothorax. Results. Of the 450 thoracenteses performed, 305 (67.8\%) were performed with sonographic guidance and 145 (32.2\%) were performed without. On postthoracentesis imaging in all subjects, 30 pneumothoraces (6.7\%) were found (23 inpatients, 7 outpatients). Eight patients required a tube thoracostomy for their pneumothorax. Pneumothorax occurred in 15 of 305 procedures (4.9\%) performed with sonographic guidance and 15 of 145 procedures (10.3\%) performed without (p {$<$} 0.05). Tube thoracostomy was performed in 0.7\% of patients whose thoracentesis was performed with sonographic guidance and in 4.1\% in those that were not (p {$<$} 0.05). We found no correlation between pneumothorax after thoracentesis and age, inpatient status, loculation of effusion, or volume of pleural fluid removed. Conclusions. The routine use of sonography during diagnostic thoracentesis is associated with a reduced rate of pneumothorax and tube thoracostomy. ª 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We aimed to determine the relationship between echocardiographic indices of right ventricular systolic function and RVEF. Methods: Prospective observational study was conducted in a mixed Surgical Intensive Care Unit (H{\^o}pital Lariboisi{\`e}re, Paris, France) from November 2017 to November 2018. All critically ill patients monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter were assessed. We collected echocardiographic indices of right ventricular function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, TAPSE; peak systolic velocity of pulsed tissue Doppler at lateral tricuspid annulus, S{$\prime$}; fractional area change, FAC; right ventricular index of myocardial performance, RIMP; isovolumic acceleration, IVA; end-diastolic diameter ratio, EDDr) and compared them with the RVEF obtained from continuous volumetric pulmonary artery catheter. Results: Twenty-five patients were analyzed. Admission diagnosis was acute heart failure in 11 patients and septic shock in 14 patients. Median age was 70 years [57--80], norepinephrine median dose was 0.29 {$\mu$}g/kg/ min [0.14--0.50], median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 12 [10--14], and mortality at day 28 was 56\%. When compared to RVEF, TAPSE had the highest correlation coefficient (rho = 0.78, 95\% CI 0.52 to 0.89, p {$<$} 0.001). S{$\prime$} was also correlated to RVEF (rho = 0.64, 95\% CI 0.60 to 0.80, p = 0.001) whereas FAC, RIMP, IVA, and EDDr did not. TAPSE lower than 16 mm, S{$\prime$} lower than 11 cm/s, and EDDr higher than 1 were always associated with a reduced RVEF. Conclusions: We found that amongst indices of right ventricular systolic function, TAPSE and S{$\prime$} were well correlated with thermodilution-derived RVEF in critically ill patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of wire-bristle grill brush injury. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional  analysis of national databases; literature review. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The  Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance  System (NEISS) was used to derive a national weighted estimate of emergency  department visits for wire bristle injury from 2002 to 2014. Date, location of  injury, demographics, and outcomes were analyzed. A literature search and a  consumer-reported injury database (SaferProducts.gov) were interrogated to  provide ancillary sources of data. RESULTS: A total of 43 cases were found within  the NEISS database, which extrapolated to an estimated 1698 (95\% confidence  interval, 1468-1927) emergency department visits nationwide. In the NEISS  database, the mean age was 30 years, and the sex distribution of the patients was  similar (21 males vs 22 females). The most common location of injury was the  oropharynx in both the NEISS database (23 of 43, 53.4\%) and the literature review  (11 of 36, 30.5\%). However, the oral cavity was the most frequent site in the  consumer-reported SaferProducts.gov database (9 of 24, 37.5\%). The majority of  patients in the NEISS were treated in the emergency department (31 of 43, 69.7\%).  Raw case counts were highest in June, July, and August, with the highest number  of events in the month of July. CONCLUSION: Injury from wire-bristle grill brush  is uncommon but prevalent during certain seasons. Otolaryngologists play an  important in the diagnosis and treatment of these injuries. Awareness among  consumers and product manufacturers is necessary to promote safety.},

Point-Of-Care ultrasound (POCUS) is widely available and could enable clinicians to detect signs of venous congestion at the bedside. The aim of this study was to develop several grading system prototypes using POCUS and to determine their respective ability to predict acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery. This is a post-hoc analysis of a single-center prospective study in 145 patients undergoing cardiac surgery for which repeated daily measurements of hepatic, portal, intra-renal vein Doppler and inferior vena cava (IVC) ultrasound were performed during the first 72 h after surgery. Five prototypes of venous excess ultrasound (VExUS) grading system combining multiple ultrasound markers were developed. Results:{\enspace} The association between each score and AKI was assessed using time-dependant Cox models as well as conventional performance measures of diagnostic testing. A total of 706 ultrasound assessments were analyzed. We found that defining severe venous congestion as the presence of severe flow abnormalities in multiple Dop-pler patterns with a dilated IVC ({$\geq$}\,2 cm) showed the strongest association with the development of subsequent AKI compared with other combinations (HR: 3.69 CI 1.65--8.24 p\,=\,0.001). The association remained significant after adjust-ment for baseline risk of AKI and vasopressor/inotropic support (HR: 2.82 CI 1.21--6.55 p\,=\,0.02). Furthermore, this severe VExUS grade offered a useful positive likelihood ratio (+LR: 6.37 CI 2.19--18.50) when detected at ICU admis-sion, which outperformed central venous pressure measurements. Conclusions:{\enspace} The combination of multiple POCUS markers may identify clinically significant venous congestion.},

The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of low-dose ketamine as an adjunct to morphine versus standard care with morphine alone for the treatment of acute moderate to severe pain among ED patients. Methods: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with three study groups was conducted at a large, urban academic ED over a 10-month period. Eligible patients were 18 to 65 years old with acute moderate to severe pain (score of at least 5 out of 10 on the numerical pain rating scale [NRS] and pain duration {$<$} 7 days) who were deemed by their treating physician to require IV opioids. The three study groups were: 1) morphine and normal saline placebo (standard care group), 2) morphine and 0.15 mg/kg ketamine (group 1), or 3) morphine and 0.3 mg/kg ketamine (group 2). Participants were assessed at 30, 60, and 120 minutes after study medication administration and received rescue analgesia as needed to target a 50\% reduction in pain. The primary outcome measure of pain relief, or pain intensity reduction, was derived using the NRS and calculated as the summed pain-intensity (SPID) difference over 2 hours. The amount and timing of rescue opioid analgesia was evaluated as a secondary outcome. The occurrence of adverse events was also measured. Results: Sixty patients were enrolled (n = 20 in each group). There were no differences between study groups with respect to age, sex, race/ethnicity, preenrollment analgesia, or baseline NRS. Over the 2hour poststudy medication administration period, the SPIDs were higher (greater pain relief) for the ketamine study groups than the control group (standard care 4.0, interquartile range [IQR] = 1.8 to 6.5; group 1 7.0, IQR = 4.3 to 10.8; and group 2 7.8, IQR = 4.8 to 12.8; p {$<$} 0.02). The SPIDs for the ketamine groups were similar (p {$<$} 0.46). When compared to standard care, group 2 sustained the reduction in pain intensity up to 2 hours, whereas group 1 was similar to standard care by 2 hours. Similar numbers of patients received rescue analgesia: standard care group, seven of 20, 35\%; group 1, four of 20, 20\%; and group 2, four of 20, 20\% (p = 0.48). Among those receiving rescue analgesia, those in the standard care group received analgesia sooner than either low-dose ketamine group, on average. More participants in the low-dose ketamine groups reported dysphoria and dizziness. Conclusions: Low-dose ketamine is a viable analgesic adjunct to morphine for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain. Dosing of 0.3 mg/kg is possibly more effective than 0.15 mg/kg, but may be associated with minor adverse events. Future studies should evaluate additional outcomes, optimum dosing, and use in specific populations.},

Underlying oesophageal conditions including eosinophilic oesophagitis (10\% in adults, up to 50\% in children), motility disorder, stenosis and diverticula are frequent.2 4 Most ingested foreign bodies will pass spontaneously.5 However, 10\%--20\% require endoscopic removal, and less than 1\% require surgical extraction or treatment of a complication.6 This review focuses on the management of foreign bodies located in the upper gastrointestinal tract, in adults. The quality of evidence of the guidelines is low; however, substantial clinical experience provides strong levels of recommendation.7 8 The management of rectal foreign bodies mostly relies on surgical, transanal extraction and is not detailed herein. Precise history (type of foreign body, time of onset) is essential. Physical examination is also mandatory. Most patients are asymptomatic. Symptoms arise when the foreign body is stuck in the oesophagus or when a complication occurs (obstruction and perforation).9 Emesis, retching, blood-stained saliva, hypersialorrhoea, wheezing and/or respiratory distress in non-communicative patients (children and psychiatric patients) are suggestive of foreign body impaction.7 Oesophageal impaction (food bolus) is often symptomatic: retching, {\dots}},

This study investigated the recognition of a cardiac arrest by dispatchers and its influence on survival rates. Methods and Results---During 8 months, voice recordings of 14 800 consecutive emergency calls were collected to audit content and cardiac arrest recognition. The presence of cardiac arrest during the call was assessed from the ambulance crew report. Included calls were placed by laypersons on site and did not involve trauma. Prevalence of cardiac arrest was 3.0\%. Of the 285 cardiac arrests, 82 (29\%) were not recognized during the call, and 64 of 267 suspected calls (24\%) were not cardiac arrest. We analyzed a random sample (nϭ506) of 9230 control calls. Three-month survival was 5\% when a cardiac arrest was not recognized versus 14\% when it was recognized (Pϭ0.04). If the dispatcher did not recognize the cardiac arrest, the ambulance was dispatched a mean of 0.94 minute later (PϽ0.001) and arrived 1.40 minutes later on scene (Pϭ0.01) compared with recognized calls. The main reason for not recognizing the cardiac arrest was not asking if the patient was breathing (42 of 82) and not asking to describe the type of breathing (16 of 82). Normal breathing was never mentioned in true cardiac arrest calls. A logistic regression model identified spontaneous trigger words like facial color that could contribute to cardiac arrest recognition (odds ratio, 7.8 to 9.7). Conclusions---Not recognizing a cardiac arrest during emergency calls decreases survival. Spontaneous words that the caller uses to describe the patient may aid in faster and better recognition of a cardiac arrest. (Circulation. 2009;119: 2096-2102.)},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of, as well as the association between, commonly used LV systolic parameters, by using serial transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Methods: Fifty patients with shock and mechanical ventilation were included. TTE examinations were performed daily for a total of 7 days. Methods used to assess LV systolic function were visually estimated, ``eyeball'' ejection fraction (EBEF), the Simpson single-plane method, mean atrioventricular plane displacement (AVPDm), septal tissue velocity imaging (TDIs), and velocity time integral in the left ventricular outflow tract (VTI). Results: EBEF, AVPDm, TDIs, VTI, and the Simpson were obtained in 100\%, 100\%, 99\%, 95\% and 93\%, respectively, of all possible examinations. The correlations between the Simpson and EBEF showed r values for all 7 days ranging from 0.79 to 0.95 (P {$<$} 0.01). the Simpson correlations with the other LV parameters showed substantial variation over time, with the poorest results seen for TDIs and AVPDm. The repeatability was best for VTI (interobserver coefficient of variation (CV) 4.8\%, and intraobserver CV, 3.1\%), and AVPDm (5.3\% and 4.4\%, respectively), and worst for the Simpson method (8.2\% and 10.6\%, respectively). Conclusions: EBEF and AVPDm provided the best, and Simpson, the worst feasibility when assessing LV systolic function in a population of mechanically ventilated, hemodynamically unstable patients. Additionally, the Simpson showed the poorest repeatability. We suggest that EBEF can be used instead of single-plane Simpson when assessing LV ejection fraction in this category of patients. TDIs and AVPDm, as markers of longitudinal function of the LV, are not interchangeable with LV ejection fraction.},

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) may be more reliable for detecting the ROSC. We investigated whether a POCUS pulse check algorithm could be used in compliance with the CPR guidelines. Methods: This was a prospective controlled and blinded multicentre manikin study involving staff from two tertiary clinical centres and their emergency medical services. A standard operating procedure for POCUS pulse checks during CPR was evaluated using a simulator in a team of four. The POCUS pulse checks were performed at the central artery following basic and advanced life support. The first pulse check was performed in the setting of pulseless electrical activity, and the second was performed in the presence of ROSC. The participants also completed a questionnaire. Results: A total of 444 pulse checks (244 manual/200 POCUS) were performed in 100 scenarios. The participants comprised physicians (34\%), nurses (15\%), non-physician emergency medical services personnel (37\%), and other medical personnel (14\%). The pulse checks took an average of 6.7 s (SD 3.9 s). Manual pulse checks (7.3 s) took longer than ultrasound pulse checks (6.1 s; p {$<$} 0.01), which were performed after a mean of 7.1 min (SD 1.7 min), during the fourth rhythm analysis in 93\% of cases, and at the femoral artery in 62\% of cases.

Aims We aimed to establish more precise estimates of suicide and suicidal behavior in refugees and asylum seekers, investigate the role of somatic and psychiatric comorbidities, and the effectiveness of preventative interventions. Methods We searched PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycInfo without time limitations from inception until June 5, 2024. Studies were included if systematic reviews or meta-analyses reporting data on suicide or suicidal behavior in refugees or asylum seekers, or detailing the results of preventive interventions. Quality was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Results Out of 49 papers, 10 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included. Refugees showed significantly higher suicide death rates and suicidal ideation, suicide plan and suicide attempt prevalence compared to people living in the host countries. Refugees who arrived in low-income and lower-middle-income countries displayed lower suicidal ideation, but higher suicide death rates and suicide attempt prevalence compared to refugees who arrived in high-income and upper-middle-income countries. However, no review provided data regarding somatic comorbidity, psychiatric comorbidity, or the effectiveness of treatments, and evidence on specific categories of refugees is scarce. Conclusion Refugees have been proven to be at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. More research is required to identify the targets and procedures of intervention.},

Quite a good number of interesting and unusual cases of foreign body ingestion has been reported in the surgical literature from time to time. Ingested foreign bodies varying widely in number, size and character, may travel through a distensible tube of comparatively small diameter causing mechanical insult to the intestinal wall without producing symptoms or permanent tissue damage. Accidental ingestion of the foreign body is by far the most common. Deliberate ingestion may result from an act of insanity, a dare, a habit or medicinal therapy. Retention of elongated or pointed objects in the duodenum is a frequent problem. Long, sharp, objects may perforate the duodenum and have been known to migrate widely in the abdomen. Early removal of such objects has been advised. This case forms rarity due to the fact that the 7 inches knife remained in the Duodenum for 07 long years without causing major catastrophe.

  abstract = {Thoughout the world the number of refugees and asylum seekers continues to increase at an astonishing rate. Given that most will have left their country due to persecution, war, or appalling violations of their human rights, many will have specific mental health needs. Cultural and socioeconomic factors play a major role in expressions of distress, help seeking, pathways into care, and acceptance or rejection of treatments. Being a refugee or asylum seeker raises questions about an individual's self respect and altered identity. Too often though, the needs of this population are ignored by policy makers and clinicians, and these people are left to fend for themselves. Mental Health of Refugees and Asylum Seekers presents both the theoretical and practical aspects of the mental health needs of refugees and asylum seekers. It looks at the impact of migration on mental health and adjustment, collective trauma, individual identity, and diagnostic fallacies. A practical section highlights cultural factors, ethnopsychopharmacology, therapeutic interaction, therapeutic expectation and psychotherapy. The final part of the book focuses on special problems - such as bereavement, sexual violence, and post traumatic stress disorders, as well as considering mental health problems in special groups, such as child refugees. This book will be an essential resource for all mental health professionals- helping them better understand the needs of refugees and asylum seekers, how their problems can be managed, and how they can best be helped.},

Methods: We undertook a systematic literature review of research about self harm that compared at least two ethnic groups in the United Kingdom. Results: 25 publications from 1765 titles and abstracts met our inclusion criteria. There was higher rate of self harm among South Asian women, compared with South Asian men and White women. In a pooled estimate from two studies, compared to their white counterparts, Asian women were more likely to self harm (Relative Risk 1.4, 95\%CI: 1.1 to 1.8, p = 0.005), and Asian men were less likely to self harm (RR 0.5, 95\% CI: 0.4 to 0.7, p {$<$} 0.001). Some studies concluded that South Asian adults self-harm impulsively in response to life events rather than in association with a psychiatric illness. Studies of adolescents showed similar methods of self harm and interpersonal disputes with parents and friends across ethnic groups. There were few studies of people of Caribbean, African and other minority ethnic groups, few studies took a population based and prospective design and few investigated self harm among prisoners, asylum seekers and refugees. Conclusion: This review finds some ethnic differences in the nature and presentation of self harm. This argues for ethnic specific preventive actions. However, the literature does not comprehensively cover the UK's diverse ethnic groups.},

In recent years, it has become fashionable for speakers before large audiences to declare that there is no scientific evidence for the clinical effectiveness of ALS-level care in the out-of-hospital setting. This study was undertaken to evaluate the evidence that pertains to the efficacy of ALS-level care in the current scientific literature. METHODS: An extensive review of the available literature was accomplished using computerized and manual means to identify all applicable articles from 1966 to October, 1995. Selected articles were read, abstracted, analyzed, and compiled. Each article also was categorized as presenting evidence supporting or refuting the clinical efficacy of ALS-level care, and a list was constructed that pointed to where the preponderance of the evidence lies. RESULTS: Research in this field differs widely in terms of methodological sophistication. Of the 51 articles reviewed, eight concluded that ALS-level care is not any more effective than is basic life support, seven concluded that it is effective in some applications but not for others, and the remainder demonstrated effectiveness. The strongest support for ALS-level care was in the area of responses to victims of cardiac arrest, whereas somewhat more divergent findings related to trauma or non condition-specific studies. CONCLUSIONS: While not unanimous, the predominant finding of recent research into the clinical effectiveness of advanced life support demonstrates improved effectiveness over basic life support for patients with certain pathologies. More outcomes-based research is needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND               Intraosseous (IO) vascular access is increasingly used as an emergency tool for achieving access to the systemic circulation in critically ill patients. The role of IO transfusion of blood in damage control resuscitation is however questionable due to possible inadequate flow rate and hemolysis. Some experts claim that IO transfusion is contraindicated. In this study, we have challenged this statement by looking at flow rates of autologous fresh whole blood reinfusion and hemolysis using two of the commonly used Food and Drug Administration--approved and Conformit{\'e} Europ{\'e}enne (CE)-marked sternal needles. Additionally, the success rate of sternal access between the two devices is evaluated.                                         METHODS               Volunteer professional military personnel, were enrolled prospectively in a nonrandomized observational study design. We collected 450 mL of autologous whole blood from each participant. Participants were divided into the following three groups of 10: Tactically Advanced Lifesaving IO Needle (T.A.L.O.N.) IO, FAST1 IO, and intravenous group. The reinfusion was done by gravity only. Blood sampling was performed before blood collection and 30 minutes after reinfusion. Investigation of hemolysis was performed by measurements of haptoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase. Success rate was evaluated by correct aspiration of bone marrow.                                         RESULTS               Median reinfusion rate was 46.2 mL/min in the FAST1 group, 32.4 mL/min in the T.A.L.O.N. group, and 74.1 mL/min in the intravenous group. Blood samples from all participants were within normal ranges. There was no statistically significant difference in haptoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase between the groups. In the FAST1 group, 1 (9\%) of 11 procedures failed. In the T.A.L.O.N. group, 4 (29\%) of 14 procedures failed.                                         CONCLUSION               Although preferable, achieving peripheral venous access in the bleeding patient is a major problem. Our findings suggest that fresh whole-blood transfusion through the IO route is safe, reliable, and provide sufficient flow for resuscitation.

Now, a 1:1:1 ratio of packed red blood cells, fresh plasma, and platelets with minimal crystalloids is the preferred resuscitative strategy (DCR era). As we have changed how we resuscitate patients, the detrimental effects associated with large volume resuscitation have also changed.

We found that existing preclinical evidence strongly supports CBD as a treatment for generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive--compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder when administered acutely; however, few studies have investigated chronic CBD dosing. Likewise, evidence from human studies supports an anxiolytic role of CBD, but is currently limited to acute dosing, also with few studies in clinical populations. Overall, current evidence indicates CBD has considerable potential as a treatment for multiple anxiety disorders, with need for further study of chronic and therapeutic effects in relevant clinical populations.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The evidence for prognostication using lactate is often based on arterial lactate (AL). Arterial sampling is painful and difficult, and carries risks. Studies comparing peripheral venous lactate (PVL) with AL showed little difference but predominantly included patients with normal lactate. The objective of this study was to measure agreement between PVL and AL in patients with elevated venous lactate. Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study. Inclusion criteria: ED patients age {$\geq$} 16, attending from October 2010 to June 2011 inclusive, with PVL {$\geq$} 2.0 mmol/L and AL taken within 1 hour. Exclusion criteria: intravenous fluid prior to or between initial venous and arterial sampling. Primary endpoint: agreement between PVL and AL defined as mean difference {\textpm} 95\% limits of agreement (LOA). The misclassification rate was assessed. Results: N = 232. VL median 3.50 mmol/L, range 2.00 to 15.00 mmol/L. AL median 2.45 mmol/L, range 1.0 to 13.2 mmol/L. The mean difference {\textpm} SD between PVL and AL for all patients was 1.06 {\textpm} 1.30 mmol/L (95\%LOA - 1.53 to 3.66 mmol/L). Using a cut-off of 2 mmol/L and 4 mmol/L, 36.2\% and 17.9\% of patients respectively were incorrectly classified as having elevated lactate. Conclusion: We report greater bias between VL and AL with broader LOA than previously documented. This may partly be due to the fact that we studied only patients with abnormal venous values, for whom close agreement would confer greatest clinical significance. The agreement between abnormal PVL and AL is poor and the high rate of misclassification may suggest that PVL is not a good substitute for AL if the venous lactate is abnormal.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The objective was to determine if focused transthoracic echocardiography (echo) can be used during resuscitation to predict the outcome of cardiac arrest. Methods: A literature search of diagnostic accuracy studies was conducted using MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases. A hand search of references was performed and experts in the field were contacted. Studies were included for further appraisal and analysis only if the selection criteria and reference standards were met. The eligible studies were appraised and scored by two independent reviewers using a modified quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS) to select the papers included in the meta-analysis. Results: The initial search returned 2,538 unique papers, 11 of which were determined to be relevant after screening criteria were applied by two independent researchers. One additional study was identified after the initial search, totaling 12 studies to be included in our final analysis. The total number of patients in these studies was 568, all of whom had echo during resuscitation efforts to determine the presence or absence of kinetic cardiac activity and were followed up to determine return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Meta-analysis of the data showed that as a predictor of ROSC during cardiac arrest, echo had a pooled sensitivity of 91.6\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 84.6\% to 96.1\%), and specificity was 80.0\% (95\% CI = 76.1\% to 83.6\%). The positive likelihood ratio for ROSC was 4.26 (95\% CI = 2.63 to 6.92), and negative likelihood ratio was 0.18 (95\% CI = 0.10 to 0.31). Heterogeneity of the results (sensitivity) was nonsignificant (Cochran's Q: v2 = 10.63, p = 0.16, and I2 = 34.1\%). Conclusions: Echocardiography performed during cardiac arrest that demonstrates an absence of cardiac activity harbors a significantly lower (but not zero) likelihood that a patient will experience ROSC. In selected patients with a higher likelihood of survival from cardiac arrest at presentation, based on established predictors of survival, echo should not be the sole basis for the decision to cease resuscitative efforts. Echo should continue to be used only as an adjunct to clinical assessment in predicting the outcome of resuscitation for cardiac arrest.},

  abstract = {Background: Human poisoning by pesticides has long been seen as a severe public health problem. As early as 1990, a task force of the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that about one million unintentional pesticide poisonings occur annually, leading to approximately 20,000 deaths. Thirty years on there is no up-to-date picture of global pesticide poisoning despite an increase in global pesticide use. Our aim was to systematically review the prevalence of unintentional, acute pesticide poisoning (UAPP), and to estimate the annual global number of UAPP. Methods: We carried out a systematic review of the scientific literature published between 2006 and 2018, supplemented by mortality data from WHO. We extracted data from 157 publications and the WHO cause-of-death database, then performed country-wise synopses, and arrived at annual numbers of national UAPP. World-wide UAPP was estimated based on national figures and population data for regions defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Results: In total 141 countries were covered, including 58 by the 157 articles and an additional 83 by data from the WHO Mortality Database. Approximately 740,000 annual cases of UAPP were reported by the extracted publications resulting from 7446 fatalities and 733,921 non-fatal cases. On this basis, we estimate that about 385 million cases of UAPP occur annually world-wide including around 11,000 fatalities. Based on a worldwide farming population of approximately 860 million this means that about 44\% of farmers are poisoned by pesticides every year. The greatest estimated number of UAPP cases is in southern Asia, followed by south-eastern Asia and east Africa with regards to non-fatal UAPP. Conclusions: Our study updates outdated figures on world-wide UAPP. Along with other estimates, robust evidence is presented that acute pesticide poisoning is an ongoing major global public health challenge. There is a need to recognize the high burden of non-fatal UAPP, particularly on farmers and farmworkers, and that the current focus solely on fatalities hampers international efforts in risk assessment and prevention of poisoning. Implementation of the international recommendations to phase out highly hazardous pesticides by the FAO Council could significantly reduce the burden of UAPP.},

Increasing prevalence of smaller, more technologically advanced toys  in the household has resulted in an increased exposure to higher voltage  batteries and powerful magnets that carry a high incidence of morbidity and  mortality. This review highlights the latest findings regarding the patients at  risk for button battery and magnet ingestions, the symptoms of presentation, and  complications of these objects in contributing to long-standing gastrointestinal  injury. RECENT FINDINGS: Button batteries may lead to esophageal injury within a  few hours. Batteries retained in the esophagus are larger in diameter on average  and size is associated with esophageal impaction as well as higher grade  esophageal injury. Magnet ingestions, when multiple or with another metallic  object, are often initially asymptomatic but may have acute worsening, and  therefore warrant close monitoring. SUMMARY: Button battery and magnet ingestions  have increased in incidence over the past two decades. Recent literature  demonstrates that higher voltage, larger lithium button batteries, and prevalence  of high-powered magnets can lead to significant morbidity. High suspicion, early  referral, and removal may lead to improved outcomes.},

  abstract = {Objectives To determine the association of sepsis with changes in host innate and adaptive immunity and to examine potential mechanisms for putative immunosuppression. Design, Setting, and Participants Rapid postmortem spleen and lung tissue harvest was performed at the bedsides of 40 patients who died in intensive care units (ICUs) of academic medical centers with active severe sepsis to characterize their immune status at the time of death (2009-2011). Control spleens (n=29) were obtained from patients who were declared brain-dead or had emergent splenectomy due to trauma; control lungs (n=20) were obtained from transplant donors or from lung cancer resections. Main Outcome Measures Cytokine secretion assays and immunophenotyping of cell surface receptor-ligand expression profiles were performed to identify potential mechanisms of immune dysfunction. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate the loss of immune effector cells. Results The mean ages of patients with sepsis and controls were 71.7 (SD, 15.9) and 52.7 (SD, 15.0) years, respectively. The median number of ICU days for patients with sepsis was 8 (range, 1-195 days), while control patients were in ICUs for 4 or fewer days. The median duration of sepsis was 4 days (range, 1-40 days). Compared with controls, anti-CD3/anti-CD28--stimulated splenocytes from sepsis patients had significant reductions in cytokine secretion at 5 hours: tumor necrosis factor, 5361 (95\% CI, 3327-7485) pg/mL vs 418 (95\% CI, 98-738) pg/mL; interferon ␥, 1374 (95\% CI, 550-2197) pg/mL vs 37.5 (95\% CI, -5 to 80) pg/mL; interleukin 6, 3691 (95\% CI, 2313-5070) vs 365 (95\% CI, 87-642) pg/mL; and interleukin 10, 633 (95\% CI, -269 to 1534) vs 58 (95\% CI, -39 to 156) pg/mL; (PϽ.001 for all). There were similar reductions in 5-hour lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cytokine secretion. Cytokine secretion in sepsis patients was generally less than 10\% that in controls, independent of age, duration of sepsis, corticosteroid use, and nutritional status. Although differences existed between spleen and lung, flow cytometric analysis showed increased expression of selected inhibitory receptors and ligands and expansion of suppressor cell populations in both organs. Unique differences in cellular inhibitory molecule expression existed in immune cells isolated from lungs of sepsis patients vs cancer patients and vs transplant donors. Immunohistochemical staining showed extensive depletion of splenic CD4, CD8, and HLA-DR cells and expression of ligands for inhibitory receptors on lung epithelial cells. Conclusions Patients who die in the ICU following sepsis compared with patients who die of nonsepsis etiologies have biochemical, flow cytometric, and immunohistochemical findings consistent with immunosuppression. Targeted immuneenhancing therapy may be a valid approach in selected patients with sepsis.},

While previous studies analyse only patients who received a massive transfusion, this study analyses those that are at risk to receive a massive transfusion, based on the trauma-associated severe haemorrhage (TASH) score, to objectively determine which patients after severe trauma would benefit or have increased complications by the use of a high FFP:RBC ratio. Methods Multicentre retrospective study from the Trauma Registry of the German Trauma Society. Multivariate logistic regression and statistical risk adjustments utilized in analyses.

The risk of death from hemorrhagic shock increases in this population. To treat the coagulopathy of trauma, some have suggested early, aggressive correction using a 1:1 ratio of plasma to red blood cell (RBC) units. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 246 patients at a US Army combat support hospital, each of who received a massive transfusion ({$>$}10 units of RBCs in 24 hours). Three groups of patients were constructed according to the plasma to RBC ratio transfused during massive transfusion. Mortality rates and the cause of death were compared among groups. Results: For the low ratio group the plasma to RBC median ratio was 1:8 (interquartile range, 0:12--1:5), for the medium ratio group, 1:2.5 (interquartile range, 1:3.0 --1:2.3), and for the high ratio group, 1:1.4 (interquartile range, 1:1.7--1:1.2) ( p {$<$} 0.001). Median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 18 for all groups (interquartile range, 14 --25). For low, medium, and high plasma to RBC ratios, overall mortality rates were 65\%, 34\%, and 19\%, ( p {$<$} 0.001); and hemorrhage mortality rates were 92.5\%, 78\%, and 37\%, respectively, ( p {$<$} 0.001). Upon logistic regression, plasma to RBC ratio was independently associated with survival (odds ratio 8.6, 95\% confidence interval 2.1--35.2). Conclusions: In patients with combatrelated trauma requiring massive transfusion, a high 1:1.4 plasma to RBC ratio is independently associated with improved survival to hospital discharge, primarily by decreasing death from hemorrhage. For practical purposes, massive transfusion protocols should utilize a 1:1 ratio of plasma to RBCs for all patients who are hypocoagulable with traumatic injuries.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Intentional and accidental foreign body ingestion are commonly encountered in clinical practice. In adults, intentional foreign body ingestion  is frequently observed among individuals with psychiatric disorders and  prisoners. Controversies exist regarding the management of sharp or pointed  objects. We contribute to this existing controversy by presenting a case of a  43-year-old male who accidently ingested a metallic screw and was managed  successfully through endoscopic retrieval. CASE PRESENTATION: We discuss a case  of a 43-year-old male presented to our emergency department after accidently  swallowing a metallic screw, 1~h and a half prior to his presentation. He was  initially asymptomatic then started to complain of vague abdominal symptoms.  X-rays of the chest and abdomen demonstrated the presence of a metallic screw at  the mid-abdomen. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen then confirmed its  presence within the gastric lumen, with no evidence of gastric or bowel  perforation. The patient was managed via esophagogastroduodenoscopy in which the  ingested screw was extracted. He was discharged after 24 hours in a good  condition. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: A limited number of epidemiological studies have  shed light on the prevalence and incidence of foreign body ingestion among adult  individuals. Probability of spontaneous passage depends on several factors  including the size, shape and composition of the impacted item, as well as the  age of patient and duration of ingestion prior to presentation. CONCLUSION:  Considering the variation of ingested objects and the availability of several  therapeutic approaches, a patient-tailored management plan should always be  established.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Foreign body (FB) ingestion is a common condition. Mostly FBs are found ingested accidently or intentionally in children and adults with mental  status alterations. Depending on the type of object, different complications can  occur. There exist numerous methods for removing each specific FB. Fortunately,  most FBs tend to move uneventfully through the gastrointestinal tract without any  intervention; but managing some foreign objects can be difficult and lead to  severe complications. Endoscopy helps with the diagnosis and treatment of these  cases, but the time of the management plays an important role. CASE PRESENTATION:  A 26-year-old female who intentionally swallowed two sewing needles, presented to  our emergency department with abdominal pain two months after the FB ingestion.  One of the sewing needles was spontaneously excreted through the bowel, and the  other was present in her body for two months. The FB had penetrated the stomach  and migrated to the peritoneal cavity. The patient's condition was managed by  laparoscopic removal of the FB and repair of the damaged tissue. According to the  traumatic nature of the needle to abdominal viscera, and standing outside the GI  tract on the pancreas surface, laparoscopic removal of the foreign metallic body  was chosen to be performed. No complication was seen during the postoperative  period. CONCLUSION: This report emphasizes the importance of prompt evaluation of  FB patients and finding the appropriate method of managing its complications.  Preventing complications requires focusing on symptoms and instant management of  the ingested FBs.},

Summary Background Data: Current fluid administration in major surgery causes a weight increase of 3-6 kg. Complications after colorectal surgery are reported in up to 68\% of patients. Associations between postoperative weight gain and poor survival as well as fluid overload and complications have been shown. Methods: We did a randomized observer-blinded multicenter trial. After informed consent was obtained, 172 patients were allocated to either a restricted or a standard intraoperative and postoperative intravenous fluid regimen. The restricted regimen aimed at maintaining preoperative body weight; the standard regimen resembled everyday practice. The primary outcome measures were complications; the secondary measures were death and adverse effects. Results: The restricted intravenous fluid regimen significantly reduced postoperative complications both by intention-to-treat (33\% versus 51\%, P = 0.013) and per-protocol (30\% versus 56\%, P = 0.003) analyses. The numbers of both cardiopulmonary (7\% versus 24\%, P = 0.007) and tissue-healing complications (16\% versus 31\%, P = 0.04) were significantly reduced. No patients died in the restricted group compared with 4 deaths in the standard group (0\% versus 4.7\%, P = 0.12). No harmful adverse effects were observed. Conclusion: The restricted perioperative intravenous fluid regimen aiming at unchanged body weight reduces complications after elective colorectal resection.},

In-depth exploration of how self-harm and suicide are portrayed in newspaper articles in a middle-income country such as Sri Lanka is lacking. Aims: We aimed to explore how self-harm and suicide are portrayed in Sri Lankan printed newspapers. Method: Seven English- and Sinhala-language Sri Lankan newspapers were screened for articles reporting on self-harm and suicide (December 1, 2014 to January 31, 2015). A thematic analysis was conducted. Results: In the 78 articles identified for analysis, certain aspects were overemphasized (inappropriate behavior) and others underemphasized (alcohol and complexities of self-harm). Explanations of self-harm were one-sided and a suicide prevention narrative was lacking. Limitations: Another time-frame and inclusion of Tamil newspapers as well as social media and online publications would provide additional understanding. Conclusion: The study found an indication of simplistic reporting. Greater focus on prevention and a nuanced portrayal of self-harm could reduce stigma and imitative behavior.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of FEEL in pre-hospital resuscitation, the incidence of potentially treatable conditions detected, and the influence on patient management. Patients, materials and methods: A prospective observational study in a pre-hospital emergency setting in patients actively undergoing cardio-pulmonary resuscitation or in a shock state. The FEEL protocol was applied by trained emergency doctors, following which a standardised report sheet was completed, including echo findings and any echo-directed change in management. These reports were then analysed independently. Results: A total of 230 patients were included, with 204 undergoing a FEEL examination during ongoing cardiac arrest (100) and in a shock state (104). Images of diagnostic quality were obtained in 96\%. In 35\% of those with an ECG diagnosis of asystole, and 58\% of those with PEA, coordinated cardiac motion was detected, and associated with increased survival. Echocardiographic findings altered management in 78\% of cases. Conclusions: Application of ALS-compliant echocardiography in pre-hospital care is feasible, and alters diagnosis and management in a significant number of patients. Further research into its effect on patient outcomes is warranted.},

Methods{\enspace} We performed a systematic literature review searching MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library and Web of Science, in addition to hand-\-searching. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they enrolled victims of community violence requiring ED treatment, evaluated interventions taking place in the ED and used violent revictimisation, arrests or intermediate outcome measures as endpoints. We included trials that had a Jadad score of 2 or above. Results{\enspace} 297 records were identified, and 13 articles were included in our final qualitative analysis, representing 10 RCTs and 9 different EVIPs. The risk of selection bias was low; the risk of performance, detection and attrition bias was moderate. 9 out of 13 papers reported statistically significant improvements in one or more outcome measures related to violence, including violent reinjury and arrests due to violence perpetration. Conclusion{\enspace} The results of this literature review show that EVIPs may be capable of reducing violent reinjury and arrests due to violence perpetration. Larger RCTs, taking place in different regions, in different age groups and using different techniques, are justified to determine which conditions may be required for success and whether EVIPs are generalisable.},

Intentional overdose  of potassium supplements is an uncommon occurrence. OBJECTIVE: This case  illustrates a novel approach to treatment of pharmacobezoar with  esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and demonstrates its effectiveness in the  setting of extended-release potassium chloride overdose. CASE REPORT: A  44-year-old female presented to the ED with intentional ingestion of an unknown  amount of extended-release potassium chloride (K-Dur{\textregistered}) tablets and alprazolam  (Xanax{\textregistered}). The patient's serum potassium was initially 7.3~mmol/L and she was  treated with standard treatments, including albuterol, calcium gluconate,  insulin, dextrose, and sodium bicarbonate. Radiographic investigation showed a  pharmacobezoar in the gastric fundus. Treatment was then augmented with whole  bowel irrigation (WBI) using polyethylene glycol solution via nasogastric tube.  Patient did not tolerate the nasogastric tube, became combative with increasing  alteration in her level of consciousness, and WBI therapy was stopped. After  discussion with the gastroenterologist, the patient was treated with EGD to  remove the pharmacobezoar. The EGD was successful in the removal of the  pharmacobezoar and the~patient's potassium normalized without complications.  CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that in cases of suspected or~confirmed potassium drug  bezoar in the stomach, physicians consider EGD for removal. This allows for  normalization of potassium level while preventing adverse sequelae.},

The main outcome measure was the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI X-1), which was completed by the patients just before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Of the 177 patients who completed the music protocol, the mean and (standard deviation) STAI-state anxiety scores were 34 (8) before and 30 (7) after the intervention. The corresponding scores for the 150 patients in the midazolam group were 36 (8) before and 34 (7) after the intervention. The decline in the STAI-state anxiety score was significantly greater in the music group compared with the midazolam group (P{$<$}0.001, 95\% confidence interval range -3.8 to -1.8). CONCLUSION: Relaxing music decreases the level of anxiety in a pre-operative setting to a greater extent than orally administrated midazolam. Higher effectiveness and absence of apparent adverse effects makes pre-operative relaxing music a useful alternative to midazolam for pre-medication.},

This study defines incidence, characteristics, and management of ingestions over time. METHODS: Cases were identified by searching radiology reports from June 2002 to December 2012 at a children's hospital and verified by chart and imaging review. Relative risk (RR) regressions determined changes in incidence and interventions over time. RESULTS: In all, 98\% of ingestions occurred since 2006; 57\% involved multiple magnets. Median age was 8~years (range 0 to 18); 0\% of single and 56\% of multiple ingestions required intervention. Compared with 2007 to 2009, ingestions increased from 2010 to 2012 (RR = 1.9, 95\% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.0). Intervention proportion was unchanged (RR = .94, 95\% confidence interval .4 to 2.2). Small spherical magnets comprised 26.8\% of ingestions since 2010; 86\% involved multiple magnets and 47\% required intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric magnet ingestions and interventions have increased. Multiple ingestions prompt more imaging and surgical interventions. Magnet safety standards are needed to decrease risk to children.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Liberal and overaggressive use of vasopressors during the initial period of shock resuscitation may compromise organ perfusion and worsen outcome. When transiently applying the concept of permissive hypotension, it would be helpful to know at which arterial blood pressure terminal cardiovascular collapse occurs. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to identify the arterial blood pressure associated with terminal cardiovascular collapse in 140 patients who died in the intensive care unit while being invasively monitored. Demographic data, co-morbid conditions and clinical data at admission and during the 24 hours before and at the time of terminal cardiovascular collapse were collected. The systolic, mean and diastolic arterial blood pressures immediately before terminal cardiovascular collapse were documented. Terminal cardiovascular collapse was defined as an abrupt ({$<$}5 minutes) and exponential decrease in heart rate ({$>$}50\% compared to preceding values) followed by cardiac arrest. Results: The mean {\textpm} standard deviation (SD) values of the systolic, mean and diastolic arterial blood pressures associated with terminal cardiovascular collapse were 47 {\textpm} 12 mmHg, 35 {\textpm} 11 mmHg and 29 {\textpm} 9 mmHg, respectively. Patients with congestive heart failure (39 {\textpm} 13 mmHg versus 34 {\textpm} 10 mmHg; P = 0.04), left main stem stenosis (39 {\textpm} 11 mmHg versus 34 {\textpm} 11 mmHg; P = 0.03) or acute right heart failure (39 {\textpm} 13 mmHg versus 34 {\textpm} 10 mmHg; P = 0.03) had higher arterial blood pressures than patients without these risk factors. Patients with severe valvular aortic stenosis had the highest arterial blood pressures associated with terminal cardiovascular collapse (systolic, 60 {\textpm} 20 mmHg; mean, 46 {\textpm} 12 mmHg; diastolic, 36 {\textpm} 10 mmHg), but this difference was not significant. Patients with sepsis and patients exposed to sedatives or opioids during the terminal phase exhibited lower arterial blood pressures than patients without sepsis or administration of such drugs. Conclusions: The arterial blood pressure associated with terminal cardiovascular collapse in critically ill patients was very low and varied with individual co-morbid conditions (for example, congestive heart failure, left main stem stenosis, severe valvular aortic stenosis, acute right heart failure), drug exposure (for example, sedatives or opioids) and the type of acute illness (for example, sepsis).},

Various instruments were developed for this purpose (by Voltolini,  Semeleder, Stoerk, Bevan, Waldenburg, Mackenzie) which however not proved to be  effective. Mostly angled or jointed tubes came into use which were stretched  after insertion. More successful were those applying simple straight tubes.

The aim of this study was to determine if the transoral roentgenogram is necessary in the evaluation of the pediatric cervical spine. Methods: A retrospective, multiinstitutional review was performed of all patients 16 years of age and under with documented cervical spine injury in a large metropolitan area during the past decade. Fifty-one children with cervical spine injury were identified from the medical records at 4 hospitals. Results: The 0- to 8-year-old age group had a significantly higher incidence of upper (occiput to C3) cervical injury than the 9- to 16-year-old age group (67\% v 39\%; P {$<$} .05). In the 0- to 8- year-old group the initial lateral/anteroposterior radiograph made the diagnosis of cervical spine injury in 13 of 15 patients (87\%), and in no patients was the transoral odontoid view used to make the diagnosis of cervical spine injury. In only 1 patient in the 9- to 16-year-old age group with a type III odontoid fracture was this view deemed useful. The overall mortality rate in this series was 7.8\% with all deaths secondary to associated head injury. Conclusions: In the 0- to 8-year-old age group in whom the incidence of cervical spine injury is rare but frequently involves the upper cervical spine, the transoral odontoid roentgenogram may be of little value in the evaluation of the spine and should not be considered necessary in 'clearing' the pediatric cervical spine. An alternative evaluation of these patients would include an initial lateral and AP radiograph, followed by computed tomography scan. Copyright (C) 2000 by W.B. Saunders Company.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Foreign body (FB) ingestions represent a common problem in children. History and physical examination are commonly not enough to diagnose a foreign  body ingestion; therefore, conventional radiography is routinely used to detect  them. Point-of-care ultrasound is widely used in the emergency department for  several diagnostic applications but there are few articles describing the  possibility to use point-of-care ultrasound to detect ingested foreign bodies,  and the necessary training to get competent in this application. The main  objective of this paper is to illustrate the use of point-of-care ultrasound  (POCUS) to detect ingested foreign bodies. The secondary objective is to describe  a limited training, necessary for emergency pediatricians, to obtain this skill.  METHODS: This is a case series of eight pediatric patients who presented to the  pediatric Emergency Department (ED), with suspected ingestion of FB, and were  assessed with POCUS. Physician sonographers were two pediatricians and three  residents in pediatrics working in two Italian Pediatric EDs. All sonographers  participated in a 2-day POCUS workshop which included the most common pediatric  POCUS applications. RESULTS: POCUS, performed by emergency pediatricians who  participated to a limited training, allowed to always identify the foreign bodies  ingested. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that an appropriate and limited training  allows pediatric emergency physicians to correctly identify foreign body in the  esophagus or stomach. Point-of-care ultrasound in foreign body ingestion in the  Emergency Department may allow to prioritize the escalation of care in children  and it can contribute to reduce the time to endoscopic management when needed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Harmfulness of foreign body ingestion and food bolus impaction (FBIs) varies according to geographical area, population, habits, and diet. Therefore,  studies may not draw generalizable conclusions. Furthermore, data regarding FBIs  management in Europe are limited and outdated. This study aimed to analyze the  endoscopic management and outcomes of FBIs in an Italian tertiary care hospital  to identify risk factors for endoscopic failure. METHODS: We retrospectively  reviewed patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for FBIs between  2007 and 2017. Baseline, clinical, FBIs, and endoscopic characteristics and  outcomes were collected and reported using descriptive statistics and logistic  regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 381 endoscopies for FBIs, 288 (75.5\%) were  emergent endoscopy and 135 (35,4\%) included underlying upper gastrointestinal  conditions. The study population included 44 pediatric patients (11.5\%), 54  prisoners (15.8\%), and 283 adults (74.2\%). The most common type and location of  FBIs were food boluses (52.9\%) and upper esophagus (36.5\%), respectively. While  eight patients (2.1\%) developed major adverse events requiring hospital  admission, the remainder (97.9\%) were discharged after observation. No mortality  occurred. Endoscopic success was achieved in 263 of 286 (91.9\%) verified FBIs  endoscopies. Endoscopic failure (8.04\%) was associated with age, bone, disk  battery, intentional ingestion, razor blade, prisoners, and stomach in the  univariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that intentional  ingestion was associated with endoscopic failure (odds ratio: 7.31; 95\%  confidence interval\>=\>2.06-25.99; P \>=\>0.002). CONCLUSION: Endoscopy for FBIs is  safe and successful, with low hospital admission rate in children, prisoners, and  adults. Intentional ingestion is a risk factor of endoscopic failure.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: A foreign body in the rectum is a rare clinical entity. These foreign bodies can be classified under two major groups: the ones that are inserted from  the anus and the ones that are swallowed and thereafter become stuck in the  rectum. METHODS: Data of patients admitted with a foreign body in the rectum  between 1988 and 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 30 patients were  reviewed. RESULTS: The most common reason for a foreign body in the rectum was  insertion for erotic purposes, which was seen in 19 of the 30 patients. All these  patients were male. The remaining 11 patients reported nonerotic causes. The most  efficient and implemented therapeutic method was simple extraction during the  first examination. CONCLUSIONS: The most common reason for a foreign body in the  rectum is insertion for erotic purposes. The first target of therapy should be  extraction of the foreign body using the simplest method possible. Meanwhile,  protecting the integrity of the intestine is of the utmost importance. The care  for maintaining the integrity of the rectum should include an evaluation of the  patient's psychological status.},

METHODS: Retrospective review of patients treated for esophageal  coin ingestion at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin over a 1-year period using  bougienage or endoscopic retrieval was conducted. (inclusion criterion) RESULTS:  Twenty-seven patients were evaluated over the 1-year study period. Two patients  spontaneously passed the coins before arrival and needed no further treatment.  Twelve patients met criteria for bougienage, and this treatment was successful in  10 of the 12 patients. Mean length of hospital stay was 2.15 hours, and the mean  cost was \$546. Thirteen patients were treated successfully with endoscopy. The  mean length of hospital stay was 22.7 hours, and the mean cost was \$5,230. There  were no complications in any of the 25 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Bougienage is  equally safe, more efficient, and much less expensive than endoscopy for  treatment of esophageal coins in properly selected patients. Nearly half of the  patients were excluded from bougienage because of delayed presentation alone.  Education of parents and physicians regarding symptoms of coin ingestion would  allow primary treatment with bougienage in the majority of cases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The resuscitation of severely injured bleeding patients has evolved into a multi-modal strategy termed damage control resuscitation (DCR). This guideline evaluates several aspects of DCR including the role of massive transfusion (MT) protocols, the optimal target ratio of plasma (PLAS) and platelets (PLT) to red blood cells (RBC) during DCR, and the role of recombinant activated factor VII (rVIIa) and tranexamic acid (TXA). METHODS: Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, a subcommittee of the Practice Management Guidelines (PMG) Section of EAST conducted a systematic review using MEDLINE and EMBASE. Articles in English from1985 through 2015 were considered in evaluating four PICO questions relevant to DCR. RESULT: A total of 37 studies were identified for analysis, of which 31 met criteria for quantitative meta-analysis. In these studies, mortality decreased with use of an MT/DCR protocol vs. no protocol (OR 0.61, 95\% CI 0.43--0.87, p = 0.006) and with a high ratio of PLAS:RBC and PLT:RBC (relatively more PLAS and PLT) vs. a low ratio (OR 0.60, 95\% CI 0.46--0.77, p {$<$} 0.0001; OR 0.44, 95\% CI 0.28--0.71, p = 0.0003). Mortality and blood product use were no different with either rVIIa vs. no rVIIa or with TXA vs. no TXA. CONCLUSION: DCR can significantly improve outcomes in severely injured bleeding patients. After a review of the best available evidence, we recommend the use of a MT/DCR protocol in hospitals that manage such patients and recommend that the protocol target a high ratio of PLAS and PLT to RBC. This is best achieved by transfusing equal amounts of RBC, PLAS, and PLT during the early, empiric phase of resuscitation. We cannot recommend for or against the use of rVIIa based on the available evidence. Finally, we conditionally recommend the in-hospital use of TXA early in the management of severely injured bleeding patients. (J Trauma Acute Care Surg. 2017;82: 605--617.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We present the second reported case of autopsy-confirmed chronic traumatic encephalopathy in a retired professional football player, with neuropathological features that differ from those of the first reported case. These differing pathological features underscore the need for further empirical elucidation of the pathoetiology and pathological cascades of long-term neurodegenerative sequelae of professional football. METHODS: A psychological autopsy was performed with the next-of-kin and wife. Medical and hospital records were reviewed. A complete autopsy was accompanied by a comprehensive forensic neuropathological examination. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed to determine apolipoprotein-E genotype. RESULTS: Pertinent premortem history included a 14-year span of play in organized football starting from the age of 18 years. The subject was diagnosed with severe major depressive disorder without psychotic features after retirement, attempted suicide multiple times and finally committed suicide 12 years after retirement by ingestion of ethylene glycol. Autopsy revealed cardiomegaly, mild to moderate coronary artery disease, and evidence of acute ethylene glycol overdose. The brain showed no atrophy, a cavum septi pellucidi was present, and the substantia nigra showed mild pallor. The hippocampus and cerebellum were not atrophic. Amyloid plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and Lewy bodies were completely absent. Sparse to frequent {$\tau$}-positive neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads were present in all regions of the brain. Tufted and thorn astrocytes, as well as astrocytic plaques, were absent. The apolipoprotein-E genotype was E3/E4. CONCLUSION: Our first and second cases both had long careers without multiple recorded concussions. Both manifested Major Depressive Disorder after retirement. Amyloid plaques were present in the first case and completely absent in the second case. Both cases exhibited neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, and coronary atherosclerotic disease. Apolipoprotein-E4 genotypes were different. Reasons for the contrasting features in these two cases are not clear. Further studies are needed to identify and define the neuropathological cascades of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in football players, which may form the basis for prophylaxis and therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Damage control resuscitation (DCR) is a strategy for resuscitating patients from hemorrhagic shock to rapidly restore homeostasis. Efforts are focused on blood product transfusion with whole blood or component therapy closely approximating whole blood, limited use of crystalloid to avoid dilutional coagulopathy, hypotensive resuscitation until bleeding control is achieved, empiric use of tranexamic acid, prevention of acidosis and hypothermia, and rapid definitive surgical control of bleeding. Patients receiving uncrossmatched Type O blood in the emergency department and later receiving cumulative transfusions of 10 or more red blood cell units in the initial 24-hour post-injury (massive transfusion) are widely recognized as being at increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to exsanguination.

The administration of vasoactive medication via peripheral intravenous access is a potential method of reducing the need for central venous access. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of vasoactive medication administered through peripheral intravenous access.                                         METHODS               Over a 20-month period starting in September 2012, we monitored the use of vasoactive medication via peripheral intravenous access in an 18-bed medical intensive care unit. Norepinephrine, dopamine, and phenylephrine were all approved for use through peripheral intravenous access.                                         RESULTS               A total of 734 patients (age 72\,{\textpm}\,15 years, male/female 398/336, SAPS II score 75\,{\textpm}\,15) received vasoactive medication via peripheral intravenous access 783 times. Vasoactive medication used was norepinephrine (n\,=\,506), dopamine (n\,=\,101), and phenylephrine (n\,=\,176). The duration of vasoactive medication via peripheral intravenous access was 49\,{\textpm}\,22 hours. Extravasation of the peripheral intravenous access during administration of vasoactive medication occurred in 19 patients (2\%) without any tissue injury following treatment, with local phentolamine injection and application of local nitroglycerin paste. There were 95 patients (13\%) receiving vasoactive medication through peripheral intravenous access who eventually required central intravenous access.                                         CONCLUSIONS                                Administration of norepinephrine, dopamine, or phenylephrine by peripheral intravenous access was feasible and safe in this single-center medical intensive care unit. Extravasation from the peripheral intravenous line was uncommon, and phentolamine with nitroglycerin paste were effective in preventing local ischemic injury. Clinicians should not regard the use of vasoactive medication is an automatic indication for central venous access.

Laboratory blood count reported  leukocytosis and alteration of principal inflammation index; at the abdominal  ultrasound no signs of perforation or collection were described. DISCUSSION:  Indication to surgery was posed and an explorative laparoscopy was performed. The  presence of local peritonitis at the right colonic flexure secondary to a full  thickness bowel perforation caused by a toothpick was found. There was also an  acute phlegmonous appendicitis. A laparoscopic appendectomy and a full-thickness  double running suture of the perforation were performed. CONCLUSION: Awareness  about dangers of ingested toothpicks needs to be taken and the intestinal  track/trace of the toothpick is mandatory until its expulsion.},

Foreign body injury (FBI) most commonly occurs in children younger than 6 years, and the incidence of FBI has increased in recent years. The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the characteristics of FBI due to ingestion and aspiration. METHODS: Data from patients who were hospitalized for FB ingestion and/or aspiration and underwent rigid bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy from 2008 to 2011 were retrospectively evaluated. Foreign body in the upper aerodigestive tract was evaluated with respect to the characteristics of patients, clinical presentation, management strategy, the outcome, and features of FB. RESULTS: A total of 192 patients admitted for FB ingestion or aspiration in the pediatric surgery department were evaluated. The mean age was 40.97 (SD, 35.73) months. The majority of patients were younger than 4 years. Foreign bodies were mainly located in the upper esophagus for ingested FBs (60.8\%), whereas for aspiration 43\% of FBs were in the main right bronchus. A total of 4 patients died. The hospitalization period of patients admitted for FB aspiration was longer than that of patients with FB ingestion. Surgery was performed in 4 patients. The most commonly ingested FBs were coins, whereas seeds were the most commonly aspirated. CONCLUSION: Prevention is the key to dealing with FBIs. Because the frequency of foreign bodies is higher in underdeveloped countries, education of parents regarding the dangers and prevention of aspiration and ingestion is important.},

A single magnet may be discharged with intestinal peristalsis, but multiple magnets may stick together and cause significant intestinal complications. Here we present a case with intestinal perforation due to ingestion of multiple magnets and metal pieces. An eight-year-old girl presented with abdominal pain and vomiting. She had abdominal tenderness and defense on the physical examination. Abdominal X-ray showed air and fluid levels. Metallic images were not considered at first as important in the diagnosis. Abdominal ultrasonography was reported as acute appendicitis. During the abdominal exploration, the appendix was normal, but there were dense adherences around the ileum and cecum. After adhesiolysis, intestinal perforations were seen in the cecum and 15 and 45 cm proximal to the cecum. Magnet and metal pieces were present in the perforated segments. Wedge resection and primary repair was performed. There were no postoperative complications, and she was discharged on the postoperative fifth day. Pediatric surgeons should be aware of the complications of multiple magnet ingestion. If the patient has a history of multiple magnet ingestion, follow-up with daily abdominal X-rays should be done, and in cases where magnets seem to cluster together or if acute abdominal signs develop, surgical exploration should be considered.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) and volume loading (VL) are standard blood-sparing procedures. However, VL is associated with hypervolemia, which may cause tissue edema, cardiopulmonary complications and a prolonged hospital stay. The body reacts to hypervolemia with release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) from the heart. ANP has been shown to deteriorate the endothelial glycocalyx, a vital part of the vascular permeability barrier. The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare ANP release and damage to the glycocalyx during ANH and VL. Methods: ANH or VL with 6\% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 was administered prior to elective surgery in patients of good cardiopulmonary health (n =9 in each group). We measured concentrations of ANP in plasma and of three main constituent parts of the glycocalyx (hyaluronan, heparan sulfate and syndecan 1) in serum before and after ANH or VL. Heparan sulfate and syndecan 1 levels in urine were also determined. Results: In contrast to ANH, VL (20 ml/kg) induced a significant release of ANP (approximately +100\%, P {$<$}0.05) and increased the serum concentration of two glycocalyx constituents, hyaluronan and syndecan 1 (both by about 80\%, P {$<$}0.05). Elevation of syndecan 1 was also detected in the urine of patients undergoing VL, but no increase was found in patients undergoing ANH. Heparan sulfate levels were not influenced by either procedure. Conclusion: These data suggest that hypervolemia increases the release of ANP and causes enhanced shedding of the endothelial glycocalyx. This perturbation must be expected to impair the vascular barrier, implying that VL may not be as safe as generally assumed and that it should be critically evaluated.},

We conducted a meta-analysis to summarize existing evidence of the diagnostic accuracy of LUS for pneumonia in adults. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of published studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of LUS against a referent CXR or chest CT scan and/or clinical criteria for pneumonia in adults aged {$\geq$}18 years. Eligible studies were required to have a CXR and/or chest CT scan at the time of evaluation. We manually extracted descriptive and quantitative information from eligible studies, and calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity using the Mantel-Haenszel method and pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR) using the DerSimonian-Laird method. We assessed for heterogeneity using the Q and I2 statistics. Results: Our initial search strategy yielded 2726 articles, of which 45 (1.7\%) were manually selected for review and 10 (0.4\%) were eligible for analyses. These 10 studies provided a combined sample size of 1172 participants. Six studies enrolled adult patients who were either hospitalized or admitted to Emergency Departments with suspicion of pneumonia and 4 studies enrolled critically-ill adult patients. LUS was performed by highly-skilled sonographers in seven studies, by trained physicians in two, and one did not mention level of training. All studies were conducted in high-income settings. LUS took a maximum of 13 minutes to conduct. Nine studies used a 3.5-5 MHz microconvex transducer and one used a 5--9 MHz convex probe. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of pneumonia using LUS were 94\% (95\% CI, 92\%-96\%) and 96\% (94\%-97\%), respectively; pooled positive and negative LRs were 16.8 (7.7-37.0) and 0.07 (0.05-0.10), respectively; and, the area-under-the-ROC curve was 0.99 (0.98-0.99). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis supports that LUS, when conducted by highly-skilled sonographers, performs well for the diagnosis of pneumonia. General practitioners and Emergency Medicine physicians should be encouraged to learn LUS since it appears to be an established diagnostic tool in the hands of experienced physicians.},

METHODS: A retrospective analysis over 12~years was conducted of 45 cases of  buried fish bones in the surrounding tissue of upper gastrointestinal tract with  complications. Meanwhile, a control group, including 39 cases of prolonged buried  fish bones in the surrounding tissue of upper gastrointestinal tract without  complications, was set. Patient clinical data were collected and analyzed to  predict the risk factors for complications. RESULTS: The results of Chi-square  test and univariate analysis both showed a significant difference in length of  fish bone ({$>$}\,2~cm), a history of concurrent medical illness (diabetes mellitus  and renal hypofunction), symptoms (medium or heavy pain and dysphagia), and  duration of significant symptoms ({$>$}\,7 days) between the complication group and  non-complication group. Multivariate analysis further identified length ({$>$}\,2~cm),  diabetes mellitus, medium or heavy pain, dysphagia, and duration of significant  symptoms ({$>$}\,7 days) as independent risk factors for complications. CONCLUSIONS:  The consequences of fish bones migrating outside the upper gastrointestinal tract  are various in different people. Awareness should be raised when encountering a  patient ingesting a long fish bone, having a history of diabetes mellitus,  presenting with significant discomforts, or these discomforts lasting for a long  time.

  abstract = {Background and aims.- Introduction.- Intentional foreign body ingestion occurs among a relatively small number of patients with psychiatric disorders; however, it is potentially very harmful and costly. Literature is remarkably sparse, with discussions of associated psychiatric symptoms and treatments limited. Most reports on intentional swallowing are found in the surgical and gastroenterological literature. They contain little to no commentary about patient intentions, or psychopathology. Self-injurious behavior is a fairly common phenomenon in psychiatric patients, particularly those with severe personality disorders. Objectives.- We aim to help characterize the association between foreign body ingestion and psychiatric disorders by presenting a case report of a young man with borderline personality disorder and polysubstance use, who repeatedly swallowed pieces of glass as a form of self-injury. Methods.- Case report: 37-year-old Caucasian male who was admitted for a fourth time after ingesting a foreign body in the context of suicidal ideation. The patient has a past psychiatry history of mood disorder, borderline personality disorder, and polysubstance use. His history is notable for multiple ED visits after ingesting broken glass, resulting in multiple endoscopic procedures (28 pieces of glass removed by colonoscopy). Results.- Repetitive foreign body ingestion is often impulsively driven and difficult to treat. As such, it results in frequent yet ineffective medical treatment. Morbidity from the ingestion itself and the procedures to remove the foreign bodies lends itself to an elevated financial burden for the health care system. Conclusions.- Understanding behavioral factors is critical for developing collaborative treatment strategies for patients suffering from this life threatening, self-injurious condition.},

While acute activation of the sympathetic nervous system is important during regular daily activities in order to maintain homeostasis or in times of stress in order to initiate a fight or flight response, chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system is associated with disease development and end-organ dysfunction. Of particular importance is the role of the sympathetic nervous system in the initiation and maintenance of hypertension and the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and insulin resistance. Given the undoubted role of the sympathetic nervous system in generating cardio-metabolic illness, inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system seems a logical choice in order to alleviate disease burden associated with these conditions. Lifestyle changes involving diet, exercise, and cognitive-based therapies as well as pharmacological and device-based interventions directly targeting the sympathetic nervous system are likely to be of benefit.},

METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 159 adult patients with confirmed diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal FBs who received endoscopic management in the emergency department. RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 57.0 {\textpm} 19.2 years, and 66 (37.7\%) of the patients were 65 years or older. Majority had a clear history and symptoms of FB ingestion. However, 9 (5.7\%) initially ignored the accidental swallowing of FBs and were diagnosed late. The mean time spent for diagnosis was 1.8 days in those with uncertain history. Only 47.1\% of those with radiographic studies had positive findings. Fish bones, press-through package and dentures were the most common culprits in this population of Asian elderly. Majority of FBs were located in the esophagus, especially in the upper third. Endoscopic FB extraction was successful in 96.9\% of cases, while surgery was required in only 5 patients. The complication rate was 6.9\%, including mucosal laceration (n = 10) and suspected perforation (n = 1), all of which were successfully managed conservatively. There was no death due to FB ingestion or endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: In FB ingestion, history usually points toward the diagnosis. Patients with an uncertain history are usually diagnosed late, and plain radiography cannot reliably predict the presence of FB. Endoscopic management is safe and effective for FBs.},

  abstract = {Foreign body (FB) ingestion of children is a common pediatric emergency requiring medical attention. Pediatric emergency physicians and gastroenterologists often  encounter nervous and distressed situations, because of children presenting with  this condition in the common clinical practice. When determining the appropriate  timing and indications for intervention, physicians should consider multiple  patient- and FB-related factors. The utilization of a flexible endoscopy is  considered safe and effective to use in these cases, with a high success rate,  for the effective extraction of FBs from the gastrointestinal tract of a child.  Additionally, a Foley catheter and a magnet-attached Levin tube have been used  for decades in the case of FB removal. Although their use has decreased  significantly in recent times, these instruments continue to be used for several  indications. Using a Foley catheter for this purpose does not require special  training and does not necessarily require sedation of the patient or fluoroscopy,  which serve as advantages of utilizing this method for foreign object retrieval.  An ingested magnet or iron-containing FB can be retrieved using a magnet-attached  tube, and can be effective to retrieve an object from any section of the upper  gastrointestinal tract that can be reached. Simple and inexpensive devices such  as Foley catheters and magnet-attached tubes can be used in emergencies such as  with the esophageal impaction of disk batteries if endoscopy cannot be performed  immediately (e.g., in rural areas and/or in patients presenting at midnight in a  facility, especially in those without access to endoscopes or emergency services,  or in any situation that warrants urgent removal of a foreign object).},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe the authors' experience with self-expandable covered metallic stents in 16 patients with malignant and benign cervical esophageal  strictures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen expandable covered metallic stents  were placed with fluoroscopic guidance in 16 patients (14 men, two women; mean  age, 60 years; age range, 26-75 years) with malignant and benign strictures of  the cervical esophagus. The causes of strictures were ingestion of corrosive  agents (n = 3), biopsy-proved squamous cell carcinoma (n = 12), and postsurgical  scarring (n = 1). The mean dysphagia scores at presentation were compared with  those after stent placement by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS:  Stent placement was technically successful in all patients. The reduction in the  mean dysphagia score after stent placement was statistically significant (P =  .0327). All patients complained of mild to severe foreign body sensation, with  four reporting severe pain necessitating immediate stent removal. With the  exception of one patient with limited follow-up, complications requiring  intervention occurred in all patients, including migration in nine patients and  tissue hyperproliferation in two. Of the 12 patients with a malignant stricture  of the esophagus, four patients eventually underwent gastrostomy for the  placement of a feeding tube and one patient underwent surgery. All four patients  with a benign cervical stricture failed to achieve long-lasting improvement with  temporary stent placement. CONCLUSIONS: Although the placement of covered  metallic stents in the cervical esophagus provides adequate initial palliation,  it is associated with poor patient tolerance and a high complication rate.},

  abstract = {The power of clinical trials depends mainly on the choice of the primary outcome measure, the statistical test, and the sample size. The most widely used outcome measure has been the five-category Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Contrary to intuition, we show that more categories do not necessarily increase the power of a trial and actually can decrease power. This is so for two reasons. The more categories of outcome measure used, the more the likelihood for misclassifications. The effect of 0\%, 10\%, and 20\% misclassification rate upon power is illustrated. Misclassification rates in two completed trials are examined based on comparative overlap in GOS and Disability Rating Scale (DRS) categories. The outcome results of the ``National Acute Brain Injury Study: Hypothermia'' indicate that the ideal number of categories also depends upon the effect of study treatment. In the recently completed hypothermia trial, the use of a dichotomized GOS (good recovery/moderate disability versus severe disability/vegetative/dead) is shown to be more sensitive than use of three or more categories of the GOS. The results point to the importance of training study investigators who will collect the outcome data. The results also indicate that the number of categories should be carefully determined using the pilot data or the data from phase II trials.},

We report a case of  meat bolus with cartilaginous component impacted in the cervical esophagus, with  a brief literature review. CASE REPORT A 64-year-old man came to our attention  for retention in the cervical esophagus of a piece of meat accidentally swallowed  during lunch. After a few attempts of endoscopic removal carried out previously  in other hospitals, the patient has been treated by us with a cervical  esophagotomy and removal of the foreign body, without any complications. We  checked the database of PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library from January  2007 to January 2017 in order to verify the presence of randomized controlled  trials, clinical trials, retrospective studies, and case series regarding the use  of the cervical esophagotomy for the extraction of foreign bodies impacted in the  esophagus. CONCLUSIONS The crucial point is to differentiate the cases that must  be immediately treated from those requiring simple observation. Endoscopic  treatment is definitely the first therapeutic option, but in case of failure of  this approach, in our opinion, cervical esophagotomy could be a safe, easy,  viable, durable approach for the extraction of foreign bodies impacted in the  cervical esophagus. Our review does not have the purpose of providing definitive  conclusions but is intended to represent a starting point for subsequent studies.},

CASE REPORT A 73-year-old diabetic  woman was admitted to the emergency room of our hospital with postprandial  abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Under the suspicion of bowel  ischemia, the patient underwent a contrast-enhanced CT scan. A thickened ileal  loop with an endoluminal bone-density foreign body was detected. The following  contrast-enhanced acquisitions additionally showed air bubbles adjacent to the  loop, as the sign of an intestinal perforation that occurred between the basal  and the contrast-enhanced acquisitions.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A pictorial review of colorectal foreign bodies and their extraction. METHODS: A prospective data-base and photographic record of patients who presented with retained colorectal foreign bodies at our institution has been maintained since 1995. Information regarding the foreign body, clinical presentation and extraction technique were documented. RESULTS: All 13 patients were male: age range 2-66 years. Seven were Caucasian, 4 African and 1 Asian. The foreign bodies included a penknife, an aerosol deodorant spray can, a blue plastic tumbler, a plastic bag containing two bank-notes and some marijuana, a plastic packet containing fish hooks, a penlight torch, a broomstick, a battery powered vibrator, a primus stove, a cap of an aerosol can, a piece of wire, a piece of hosepipe wrapped with wire and an iron bar. They entered the alimentary tract for a variety of reasons; anal autoeroticism (3), concealment (2), attention seeking behaviour (3), accidental (1), assault (2) and to alleviate constipation (2). Plain radiographs accurately demonstrated the site of the foreign body in 8 patients. Extraction was at laparotomy in 2 patients with peritonitis and in 3 who required extraction by colotomy. In 7 patients who had transanal extraction, four required general anaesthesia to facilitate extraction and extraction was possible under conscious sedation in the emergency room in three. The remaining patient extracted the foreign body himself and presented to hospital with a rectal perforation. CONCLUSION: The emergency room physician must confirm the presence of a rectal foreign body. Extraction in the emergency room is usually not possible and patient's with retained rectal foreign bodies should be referred to a colorectal surgeon.},

Results Of a total of 6020 adult surgical patients on the database 3053 elective patients, 1664 nonseptic, 52 duplicates and 11 patients with missing systolic BP were excluded to leave a cohort of 1232 acute, septic surgical patients. The Median age (IQR): 48 (32-62) and roughly 50:50 gender ratio (620 female: 609 male). The majority of patients were African: 988 (80.2\%) followed by Asians (128 or 10.4\%). Over two-thirds (852 or 69.2\%) of the patient cohort underwent some form of surgery and 152 or 12.3\% required ICU admission. The median length of ICU stay (IQR) was 2 (1-4.5) days. The median length of total hospital stay (IQR) was 4 (2-9) days. The median systolic BP (IQR) on admission was 122 (107-138). A total of 167patients died (13.6\%). Those that died did have a significantly lower mean systolic BP compared to the survivors (116 vs 125, p{$<$}0.001). Six out of 10 patients (60\%) with a systolic BP {$<$}70 died. The ROC analysis suggests an optimal systolic BP cut-off of 111 when predicting mortality [area under the ROC curve (AUC): 0.6 (0.551, 0.65)]. This cut-off yields a moderate sensitivity (70\%), high PPV (90\%) but low specificity and NPV when predicting mortality. Based on this optimal cut-off 388 or 31.5\% of patients would be classified as shocked. The inflection curve below with fitted non-linear curve (95\% confidence intervals) clearly shows the upward change in observed mortality frequency at lower systolic and BE (i.e. base deficit) values. Shocked patients had a significantly higher frequency of mortality (20\% vs 11\%, p{$<$}0.001),a significantly higher median lactate (1.9 vs 1.5, p{$<$}0.001), and mean base deficit (-2.8 vs -1.0, p=0.001). No significant difference in mean age, ICU admission, duration of ICU admission and total length of hospital stay was observed by shocked status. Conclusion Our data suggests that patients who die have a significantly lower systolic BP and clinically significant hypotension in sepsis with regards to increased mortality risk begins at a level of {\textasciitilde}111 mm Hg and this finding needs to be incorporated into bundles of care for surgical sepsis.},

  abstract = {Background Refugees, and other forcibly displaced people, face mental distress and may be disproportionately affected by risk factors for suicide. Little is known about suicidal behaviour in these highly mobile populations because collecting timely, relevant, and reliable data is challenging. Methods and findings A systematic review was performed to identify studies of any design reporting on suicide, suicide attempts, or suicidal ideation among populations of displaced people. A sensitive electronic database search was performed in August 2020, and all retrieved studies were screened for relevance by two authors. Studies were categorised by the population being evaluated: refugees granted asylum, refugees living in temporary camps, asylum seekers, or internally displaced people. We distinguished between whether the sampling procedure in the studies was likely to be representative, or the sample examined a specific non-representative subgroup of displaced people (such as those already diagnosed with mental illness). Data on the rates of suicide or the prevalence of suicide attempts or suicidal ideation were extracted by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer from each study and converted to common metrics. After screening 4347 articles, 87 reports of 77 unique studies were included. Of these, 53 were studies in representative samples, and 24 were based on samples of specific target populations. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries, and the most studied population subgroup was refugees granted asylum. There was substantial heterogeneity across data sources and measurement instruments utilised. Sample sizes of displaced people ranged from 33 to 196,941 in studies using general samples. Suicide rates varied considerably, from 4 to 290 per 100,000 person-years across studies. Only 8 studies were identified that compared suicide rates with the host population. The prevalence of suicide attempts ranged from 0.14\% to 15.1\% across all studies and varied according to the prevalence period evaluated. Suicidal ideation prevalence varied from 0.17\% to 70.6\% across studies. Among refugees granted asylum, there was evidence of a lower risk of suicide compared with the host population in 4 of 5 studies. In contrast, in asylum seekers there was evidence of a higher suicide risk in 2 of 3 studies, and of a higher risk of suicidal ideation among refugees living in camps in 2 of 3 studies compared to host populations. Conclusion While multiple studies overall have been published in the literature on this topic, the evidence base is still sparse for refugees in camps, asylum seekers, and internally displaced people. Less than half of the included studies reported on suicide or suicide attempt outcomes, with most reporting on suicidal ideation. International research networks could usefully define criteria, definitions, and study designs to help standardise and facilitate more research in this important area.

Radiologic images showed multiple sewing needles in the gastrointestinal tract and adjacent structures.

His previous and new scans revealed multiple metallic screws and safety pins throughout the gastrointestinal tract.

In humans, pathologic microcirculatory dysfunction can be directly visualized by intravital microscopy or indirectly measured via detection of circulating biomarkers, such as endothelial glycocalyx fragments. While several treatments have been shown to protect the microcirculation during sepsis, these therapies have not improved patient outcomes when applied indiscriminately. Future outcomes-oriented studies are needed to test the utility of sepsis therapeutics when applied in a manner ``personalized'' to a patient's microcirculatory dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the effects of recent innovations in trauma major hemorrhage management on outcome and transfusion practice, and to determine the contemporary timings and patterns of death. Background: The last 10 years have seen a research-led change in hemorrhage management to damage control resuscitation (DCR), focused on the prevention and treatment of trauma-induced coagulopathy. Methods: A 10-year retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of trauma patients who activated the Major Trauma Centre's major hemorrhage protocol (MHP) and received at least 1 unit of red blood cell transfusions (RBC). Results: A total of 1169 trauma patients activated the MHP and received at least 1 unit of RBC, with similar injury and admission physiology characteristics over the decade. Overall mortality declined from 45\% in 2008 to 27\% in 2017, whereas median RBC transfusion rates dropped from 12 to 4 units (massive transfusion rates from 68\% to 24\%). The proportion of deaths within 24 hours halved (33\%--16\%), principally with a fall in mortality between 3 and 24 hours (30\%--6\%). Survivors are now more likely to be discharged to their own home (57\%--73\%). Exsanguination is still the principal cause of early deaths, and the mortality associated with massive transfusion remains high (48\%). Late deaths are now split between those due to traumatic brain injury (52\%) and multiple organ dysfunction (45\%). Conclusions: There have been remarkable reductions in mortality after major trauma hemorrhage in recent years. Mortality rates continue to be high and there remain important opportunities for further improvements in these patients.},

  abstract = {Objective: To evaluate patient-related and procedure-related risk factors for thoracentesisrelated pneumothorax. Design: Prospective, nonrandomized cohort study. Setting: Pulmonary Special Procedures Unit of a university medical center. Methods: Thoracentesis using either a 22-gauge, a Boutin, or a Cope needle (depending on availability and operator preference) was performed by the pulmonary faculty or by pulmonary physicians-in-training under faculty supervision. In order to control for effusion size and the presence of loculations, chest radiography and pleural ultrasonography were performed prior to each thoracentesis. Potential patient-related and procedure-related risk factors for pneumothorax were analyzed at the procedure level using the presence or absence of pneumothorax on the postprocedure chest radiograph as the sole outcome variable. Results: Two hundred fifty-five thoracenteses were performed in 205 adult patients (113 men and 92 women; mean age, 58.8 ؎ 18 years) over a 31{\textfractionsolidus}2-year period. One hundred fifty procedures were performed for diagnostic purposes, 28 procedures were performed for therapeutic purposes, and 77 procedures were performed for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Based on the radiographic criteria, 152 effusions (60\%) were small. Loculations were present in 76 patients (30\%). Pneumothoraces occurred in 14 instances (5.4\%), and chest tube drainage was required in 2 instances (0.78\%). Hospitalization status, critical illness, effusion size or type, presence of loculations, operator, needle type, amount of fluid withdrawn, occurrence of dry tap, and type of thoracentesis were not associated with an increased frequency of pneumothorax. The only predictor variable demonstrating statistical significance was repeated thoracentesis. Conclusion: The results of a bivariate analysis suggest that pneumothorax following thoracentesis is a rare event that is not easily predictable when the procedure is performed by experienced operators in a controlled setting.},

  abstract = {Background: Injury to the cervical spine (CS) is common after major trauma. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma first published its Practice Management Guidelines for the evaluation of CS injury in 1998. A subsequent revision was published in 2000. Since that time a large volume of literature has been published. As a result, the Practice Management Guidelines Committee set out to develop updated guidelines for the identification of CS injury. Methods: A search of the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health MEDLINE database was performed using PubMed (www.pubmed.gov). The search retrieved English language articles regarding the identification of CS injury from 1998 to 2007. The questions posed were: who needs CS imaging; what imaging should be obtained; when should computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or flexion/extension radiographs be used; and how is significant ligamentous injury excluded in the comatose patient? Results: Seventy-eight articles were identified. From this group, 52 articles were selected to construct the guidelines. Conclusion: There have been significant changes in practice since the previous CS injury guidelines. Most significantly, computed tomography has supplanted plain radiography as the primary screening modality in those who require imaging. Clinical clearance remains the standard in awake, alert patients with trauma without neurologic deficit or distracting injury who have no neck pain or tenderness with full range of motion. Cervical collars should be removed as soon as feasible. Controversy persists regarding CS clearance in the obtunded patient without gross neurologic deficit. {\copyright} 2009 by Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

  journal = {n engl j med},
  abstract = {Background Optimal fluid management in patients with acute lung injury is unknown. Diuresis or fluid restriction may improve lung function but could jeopardize extrapulmonaryorgan perfusion. Methods In a randomized study, we compared a conservative and a liberal strategy of fluid management using explicit protocols applied for seven days in 1000 patients with acute lung injury. The primary end point was death at 60 days. Secondary end points included the number of ventilator-free days and organ-failure--free days and measures of lung physiology. Results The rate of death at 60 days was 25.5 percent in the conservative-strategy group and 28.4 percent in the liberal-strategy group (P = 0.30; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -2.6 to 8.4 percent). The mean ({\textpm}SE) cumulative fluid balance during the first seven days was --136{\textpm}491 ml in the conservative-strategy group and 6992{\textpm}502 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P{$<$}0.001). As compared with the liberal strategy, the conservative strategy improved the oxygenation index ([mean airway pressure {\texttimes} the ratio of the fraction of inspired oxygen to the partial pressure of arterial oxygen] {\texttimes} 100) and the lung injury score and increased the number of ventilatorfree days (14.6{\textpm}0.5 vs. 12.1{\textpm}0.5, P{$<$}0.001) and days not spent in the intensive care unit (13.4{\textpm}0.4 vs. 11.2{\textpm}0.4, P{$<$}0.001) during the first 28 days but did not increase the incidence or prevalence of shock during the study or the use of dialysis during the first 60 days (10 percent vs. 14 percent, P = 0.06). Conclusions Although there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of 60-day mortality, the conservative strategy of fluid management improved lung function and shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care without increasing nonpulmonary-organ failures. These results support the use of a conservative strategy of fluid management in patients with acute lung injury. (ClinicalTrials. gov number, NCT00281268.)},

  abstract = {Shock is deadly and unpredictable if it is not recognized and treated in early stages of hemorrhage. Unfortunately, measurements of standard vital signs that are displayed on current medical monitors fail to provide accurate or early indicators of shock because of physiological mechanisms that effectively compensate for blood loss. As a result of new insights provided by the latest research on the physiology of shock using human experimental models of controlled hemorrhage, it is now recognized that measurement of the body's reserve to compensate for reduced circulating blood volume is the single most important indicator for early and accurate assessment of shock. We have called this function the ``compensatory reserve,'' which can be accurately assessed by real-time measurements of changes in the features of the arterial waveform. In this paper, the physiology underlying the development and evaluation of a new noninvasive technology that allows for real-time measurement of the compensatory reserve will be reviewed, with its clinical implications for earlier and more accurate prediction of shock.},

  abstract = {Trauma patients with ``compensated'' internal hemorrhage may not be identified with standard medical monitors until signs of shock appear, at which point it may be difficult or too late to pursue life-saving interventions. We tested the hypothesis that a novel machine-learning model called the compensatory reserve index (CRI) could differentiate tolerance to acute volume loss of individuals well in advance of changes in stroke volume (SV) or standard vital signs. Two hundred one healthy humans underwent progressive lower body negative pressure (LBNP) until the onset of hemodynamic instability (decompensation). Continuously measured photoplethysmogram signals were used to estimate SV and develop a model for estimating CRI. Validation of the CRI was tested on 101 subjects who were classified into two groups: low tolerance (LT; n = 33) and high tolerance (HT; n = 68) to LBNP (mean LBNP time: LT = 16.23 min vs. HT = 25.86 min). On an arbitrary scale of 1 to 0, the LT group CRI reached 0.6 at an average time of 5.27 {\textpm} 1.18 (95\% confidence interval) min followed by 0.3 at 11.39 {\textpm} 1.14 min. In comparison, the HT group reached CRI of 0.6 at 7.62 {\textpm} 0.94 min followed by 0.3 at 15.35 {\textpm} 1.03 min. Changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and SV did not differentiate HT from LT groups. Machine modeling of the photoplethysmogram response to reduced central blood volume can accurately trend individual-specific progression to hemodynamic decompensation. These findings foretell early identification of blood loss, anticipating hemodynamic instability, and timely application of life-saving interventions.},

Methods From December 2002 through April 2010, we randomly assigned 155 adults with severe diffuse traumatic brain injury and intracranial hypertension that was refractory to first-tier therapies to undergo either bifrontotemporoparietal decompressive craniectomy or standard care. The original primary outcome was an unfavorable outcome (a composite of death, vegetative state, or severe disability), as evaluated on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale 6 months after the injury. The final primary outcome was the score on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale at 6 months. Results Patients in the craniectomy group, as compared with those in the standard-care group, had less time with intracranial pressures above the treatment threshold (P{$<$}0.001), fewer interventions for increased intracranial pressure (P{$<$}0.02 for all comparisons), and fewer days in the intensive care unit (ICU) (P{$<$}0.001). However, patients undergoing craniectomy had worse scores on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale than those receiving standard care (odds ratio for a worse score in the craniectomy group, 1.84; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 3.24; P\,=\,0.03) and a greater risk of an unfavorable outcome (odds ratio, 2.21; 95\% CI, 1.14 to 4.26; P\,=\,0.02). Rates of death at 6 months were similar in the craniectomy group (19\%) and the standard-care group (18\%). Conclusions In adults with severe diffuse traumatic brain injury and refractory intracranial hypertension, early bifrontotemporoparietal decompressive craniectomy decreased intracranial pressure and the length of stay in the ICU but was associated with more unfavorable outcomes.

Methods: Prospective observational study of spontaneously breathing ICU patients. Fluid responsiveness was defined as a {$>$}10\% increase in cardiac index following a 500 mL fluid bolus, measured by bioreactance. Novice sonologist measured cIVC with POCUS. Their measurements were later compared to an expert physician sonologist who independently reviewed the POCUS images and assessed cIVCs. Results: Of the 85 participants, 44 (52\%) were fluid responders. A 25\% cIVC cutoff value performed better when assessed by expert sonologists than novice physician sonologists (receiver--operator characteristic curve, ROC {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.82 [0.74-0.88] vs ROC {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.69 [0.60-0.77]).

  abstract = {Purpose: To investigate whether renal Doppler resistive index (RI) changes occur early during posttraumatic bleeding and may be predictive of occult hypoperfusion - and thus hemorrhagic shock - in patients with polytrauma. Materials and Methods: This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. The renal Doppler RI was measured in 52 hemodynamically stable adult patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) because of polytrauma. Renal Doppler RI, hemoglobin, standard base excess, lactate, systolic blood pressure, pH, heart rate, and inferior vena cava diameter values were recorded at admittance and correlated with outcome (progression or nonprogression to hemorrhagic shock). Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the risk factors for progression to hemorrhagic shock. Results: Twenty-nine patients developed hemorrhagic shock, and 23 did not. At univariable analysis, the hemorrhagic shock group, as compared with the nonhemorrhagic shock group, had higher renal Doppler RI (mean, 0.80 {\textpm} 0.10 [standard deviation] vs 0.63 {\textpm} 0.03; P {$<$} .01), injury severity score (mean, 36 {\textpm} 11 vs 26 {\textpm} 5; P {$<$} .01), and standard base excess (mean, -4.0 mEq/L {\textpm} 4 vs 1 mEq/L {\textpm} 3; P =.04) values. At logistic regression analysis, a renal Doppler RI greater than 0.7 (vs less than or equal to 0.7) was the only independent risk factor for progression to hemorrhagic shock (odds ratio, 57.8; 95\% confidence interval: 10.5, 317.0)(P {$<$} .001). Conclusion: In polytrauma patients who are hemodynamically stable at admittance to the ED, renal cortical blood flow redistribution occurs very early in response to occult bleeding and might be noninvasively detected by using the renal Doppler RI. A renal Doppler RI greater than 0.7 is predictive of progression to hemorrhagic shock in polytrauma patients. {\copyright} RSNA, 2011.},

  abstract = {Background: The knowledge of new prognostic factors in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) that can be evaluated since the beginning of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) manoeuvres could be helpful in the decisionmaking process of prehospital care. We aim to identify metabolic variables at the start of advanced CPR at the scene that may be associated with two main outcomes of CPR (recovery of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and neurological outcome). Methods: Prospective observational study of all non-traumatic OHCA in patients older than 17 years assisted by emergency medical services (EMS), with doctor and nurse on board, between January 2012 and December 2017. Venous blood gases were sampled upon initially obtaining venous access to determine the initial values of pH, pCO2, HCO3-, base excess (BE), Na+, K+, Ca2+ and lactate. ROSC upon arrival at the hospital and neurological status 30 days later (Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) scale) were recorded. Results: We included 1552 patients with OHCA with blood test data in a 6-year period. ROSC was achieved in 906 cases (58.4\%), and good neurological recovery at 30 days (CPC I-II) occurred in 383 cases (24.68\%). In multivariate analysis, we found a significant relationship between non-recovery of spontaneous circulation (no-ROSC) and low pH levels (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.03 (0.002--0.59), p = 0.020), high pCO2 levels (adjusted OR 1.03 [1.01--1.05], p = 0.008) and high potassium levels (adjusted OR 2.28 [1.43--3.61], p = 0.008). Poor neurological outcomes were associated with low pH levels (adjusted OR 0.06 [0.02--0.18], p {$<$} 0.001), high pCO2 (adjusted OR 1.05 [1.03--1.08], p {$<$} 0.001), low HCO3- (adjusted OR 0.97 [0.94--0.999], p = 0.044), low BE (adjusted OR 0.96 [0.93--0.98], p {$<$} 0.001) and high potassium levels (adjusted OR 1.37 [1.16--1.60], p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion: There is a significant relationship between severe alterations of venous blood-gas variables and potassium at the start of CPR of non-traumatic OHCA and low-ROSC rate and neurological prognosis.},

Design A prospective clinical study. Methods Lung ultrasound and CXR were performed in sequence in adult patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) for suspected pneumonia. A chest CT scan was performed during hospital stay when clinically indicated. Results 120 patients entered the study. A discharge diagnosis of pneumonia was confirmed in 81 (67.5\%). The first CXR was positive in 54/81 patients (sensitivity 67\%; 95\% CI 56.4\% to 76.9\%) and negative in 33/39 (specificity 85\%; 95\% CI 73.3\% to 95.9\%), whereas lung ultrasound was positive in 80/81 (sensitivity 98\%; 95\% CI 93.3\% to 99.9\%) and negative in 37/39 (specificity 95\%; 95\% CI 82.7\% to 99.4\%). A CT scan was performed in 30 patients (26 of which were positive for pneumonia); in this subgroup the first CXR was diagnostic for pneumonia in 18/26 cases (sensitivity 69\%), whereas ultrasound was positive in 25/26 (sensitivity 96\%). The feasibility of ultrasound was 100\% and the examination was always performed in less than 5 min. Conclusions Bedside chest ultrasound is a reliable tool for the diagnosis of pneumonia in the ED, probably being superior to CXR in this setting. It is likely that its wider use will allow a faster diagnosis, conducive to a more appropriate and timely therapy.},

The latest European guidelines for the management of hemorrhagic shock suggest the use of vasopressors (norepinephrine) in order to restore an adequate mean arterial pressure when fluid resuscitation therapy fails to restore blood pressure. The administration of arginine vasopressin (AVP), or its analogue terlipressin, has been proposed as an alternative treatment in the early stages of hypovolemic shock. Design. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled animal trials. Participants. A total of 433 animals from 15 studies were included. Interventions. The ability of AVP and terlipressin to reduce mortality when compared with fluid resuscitation therapy, other vasopressors (norepinephrine or epinephrine), or placebo was investigated. Measurements and Main Results. Pooled estimates showed that AVP and terlipressin consistently and significantly improve survival in hemorrhagic shock (mortality: 26/174 (15\%) in the AVP group versus 164/259 (63\%) in the control arms; OR = 0.09; 95\% CI 0.05 to 0.15; P for effect {$<$} 0.001; P for heterogeneity = 0.30; I 2 = 14 \%). Conclusions. Results suggest that AVP and terlipressin improve survival in the early phases of animal models of hemorrhagic shock. Vasopressin seems to be more effective than all other treatments, including other vasopressor drugs. These results need to be confirmed by human clinical trials.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There have been several attempts to derive syncope prediction tools to guide clinician decision-making. However, they have not been largely adopted, possibly because of their lack of sensitivity and specificity. We sought to externally validate the existing tools and to compare them with clinical judgment, using an individual patient data meta-analysis approach. METHODS: Electronic databases, bibliographies, and experts in the field were screened to find all prospective studies enrolling consecutive subjects presenting with syncope to the emergency department. Prediction tools and clinical judgment were applied to all patients in each dataset. Serious outcomes and death were considered separately during emergency department stay and at 10 and 30 days after presenting syncope. Pooled sensitivities, specificities, likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratios, with 95\% confidence intervals, were calculated. RESULTS: Thirteen potentially relevant papers were retrieved (11 authors). Six authors agreed to share individual patient data. In total, 3681 patients were included. Three prediction tools (Osservatorio Epidemiologico sulla Sincope del Lazio [OESIL], San Francisco Syncope Rule [SFSR], Evaluation of Guidelines in Syncope Study [EGSYS]) could be assessed by the available datasets. None of the evaluated prediction tools performed better than clinical judgment in identifying serious outcomes during emergency department stay, and at 10 and 30 days after syncope. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the use of an individual patient data approach to reduce heterogeneity among studies, a large variability was still present. Current prediction tools did not show better sensitivity, specificity, or prognostic yield compared with clinical judgment in predicting short-term serious outcome after syncope. Our systematic review strengthens the evidence that current prediction tools should not be strictly used in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Increasing evidence has demonstrated that aggressive crystalloid-based resuscitation strategies are associated with cardiac and pulmonary complications, gastrointestinal dysmotility, coagulation disturbances, and immunological and inflammatory mediator dysfunction. As large volumes of fluids are administered, imbalances in intracellular and extracellular osmolarity occur. Disturbances in cell volume disrupt numerous regulatory mechanisms responsible for keeping the inflammatory cascade under control. Several authors have demonstrated the detrimental effects of large, crystalloid-based resuscitation strategies on pulmonary complications in specific surgical populations. Additionally, fluid-restrictive strategies have been associated with a decreased frequency of and shorter time to recovery from acute respiratory distress syndrome and trends toward shorter lengths of stay and lower mortality. Early resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock with predominately saline-based regimens has been associated with cardiac dysfunction and lower cardiac output, as well as higher mortality. Numerous investigators have evaluated potential risk factors for developing abdominal compartment syndrome and have universally noted the excessive use of crystalloids as the primary determinant. Resuscitation regimens that cause early increases in blood flow and pressure may result in greater hemorrhage and mortality than those regimens that yield comparable flow and pressure increases late in resuscitation. Future resuscitation research is likely to focus on improvements in fluid composition and adjuncts to administration of large volume of fluid.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE---To determine if implementation of damage control resuscitation (DCR) in patients undergoing damage control laparotomy (DCL) translates into improved survival. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA---DCR aims at preventing coagulopathy through permissive hypotension, limiting crystalloids and delivering higher ratios of plasma and platelets. Previous work has focused only on the impact of delivering higher ratios (1:1:1). METHODS---A retrospective cohort study was performed on all DCL patients admitted between 01/2004--08/2010. Patients were divided into pre-DCR implementation and DCR groups, and were excluded if they died prior to completion of the initial laparotomy. The lethal triad was defined as immediate post-operative temperature {$<$}95{$^\circ$} F, INR{$>$}1.5, or a pH{$<$}7.30. RESULTS---390 patients underwent DCL. Of these, 282 were pre-DCR and 108 were DCR. Groups were similar in demographics, injury severity, admission vitals and laboratory values. DCR patients received less crystalloids (median 14 L vs. 5 L), RBC (13 U vs. 7 U), plasma (11 U vs. 8 U) and platelets (6 U vs. 0 U) in 24-hr; all p{$<$}0.05. DCR patients had less evidence of the lethal triad upon ICU arrival (80\% vs. 46\%, p{$<$}0.001). 24-hour and 30-day survival were higher with DCR (88\% vs. 97\%, p=0.006 and 76\% vs. 86\%, p=0.03). Multivariate analysis controlling for age, injury severity, and ED variables, demonstrated DCR was associated with a significant increase in 30-day survival (O.R. 2.5, 95\% C.I. 1.10--5.58, p=0.028). CONCLUSION---In patients undergoing DCL, implementation of DCR reduces crystalloid and blood product administration. More importantly, DCR is associated with an improvement in 30day survival.},

Methods This non-inferiority, parallel-group, randomized, open-label clinical trial enrolled UK adults hospitalized with neutropenic sepsis. Participants were randomly assigned to either switch to oral ciprofloxacin plus co-amoxiclav within 12--24~hours or to continue intravenous treatment for at least 48~hours. The primary outcome was a composite measure of treatment failure, 14~days after randomization. The non-inferiority margin was 15\%. Results There were 129 participants from 16 centres and 125 were assessed for the primary outcome. Of these, 113 patients completed protocolized treatment and comprised the per-protocol population. In total, 9 (14.1\%) of 64 patients in the standard care arm met the primary end point, compared with 15 (24.6\%) of 61 in the early switch arm, giving a risk difference of 10.5\% (1-sided 95\% CI,~-{$\infty\%$} to 22\%; p 0.14).

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM) complicates approximately 2\% of pregnancies and can be either spontaneous or iatrogenic in nature. Complications of PPROM include prematurity, chorioamnionitis, neonatal sepsis, limb position defects, respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary hypoplasia chronic lung disease, periventricular leukomalacia and intraventricular haemorrhage. A number of different sealing techniques have been employed which aim to restore a physical barrier against infection and encourage the re-accumulation of amniotic fluid. Routine use of sealants is currently not recommended due to a lack of sufficient evidence to support the safety and effectiveness of such interventions. Objectives To assess the effects of sealing techniques following PPROM against each other, or versus standard care (including no sealant), on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 May 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different techniques for sealing preterm prelabour ruptured membranes. Cluster-randomised trials and trials using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion in this review. We planned to include abstracts when sufficient information was provided. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed trial quality. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. Main results We included two studies (involving 141 women - with data from 124 women). We considered both studies as being at high risk of bias. Meta-analysis was not possible because the included studies examined different interventions (both in comparison with standard care) and reported on few, but different, outcomes. One study compared cervical adapter (mechanical sealing), and the other study examined an immunological membrane sealant. Neither of the included studies reported on this review's primary outcome of interest - perinatal mortality. Similarly, data were not reported for the majority of this review's secondary infant and maternal outcomes. Cervical adapter (mechanical sealing) versus standard care (one study, data from 35 participants) No data were reported for this review's primary outcome -  perinatal mortality . Data were reported for few of this review's infant or maternal secondary outcomes. There was no clear difference between the mechanical sealing group and the standard care control in relation to the incidence of  neonatal sepsis  (risk ratio (RR) 1.19, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 5.09 ( very low-quality evidence )) or  chorioamnionitis  (RR 1.19, 95\% CI 0.28 to 5.09 ( very low-quality evidence )). Oral immunological membrane sealant versus standard care (one study, data from 94 participants) No data were available for  perinatal mortality  (this review's primary outcome) or for the majority of this review's infant and maternal secondary outcomes. Compared to standard care, the immunological membrane sealant was associated with a reduction in  preterm birth less than 37 weeks  (RR 0.48, 95\% CI 0.34 to 0.68 ( very low-quality evidence )) and a reduction in  neonatal death  (RR 0.38, 95\% CI 0.19 to 0.75 ( very low-quality evidence) ). However, there was no clear difference between groups in terms of  neonatal sepsis  (RR 0.64, 95\% CI 0.28 to 1.46 ( very low-quality evidence )) or  respiratory distress syndrome  (RR 0.64, 95\% CI 0.28 to 1.46 ( very low-quality evidence )). Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to evaluate sealing procedures for PPROM. There were no data relating to this review's primary outcome (perinatal mortality) and the majority of our infant and maternal secondary outcomes were not reported in the two included studies. There was limited evidence to suggest that an immunological membrane sealant was associated with a reduction in preterm birth at less than 37 weeks and neonatal death, but these results should be interpreted with caution as this is based on one small study, with a high risk of bias, and the intervention has not been tested in other studies. Although midtrimester PPROM is not a rare occurrence, there are only a small amount of published data addressing the benefits and risks of sealing procedures. Most of these studies are retrospective and cohort based and could therefore not be included in our data-analysis. This review highlights the paucity of prospective randomised trials in this area. Current evidence provides limited information both on effectiveness and safety for the interventions described. Given the paucity of high-quality data, we recommend that future research efforts focus on the conduct of randomised trials assessing the effect of promising interventions that have been only evaluated to date in cohort studies (e.g. amniopatch). Future trials should address outcomes including perinatal mortality, preterm birth, neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal sepsis and developmental delay. They should also evaluate maternal outcomes including sepsis, mode of delivery, length of hospital stay and emotional well-being. Plain language summary Treatments for improving outcomes for mother and baby when the waters have broken too early What is the issue? Preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM) is when the waters break at less than 37 weeks' gestation. It occurs in one in 50 pregnancies and can happen spontaneously or after a medical procedure has been performed, for example, tests where a needle is placed in to the womb to get a sample of fluid or tissue, or after an operation has been performed on the baby inside the womb. Why is this important? Breaking of the waters early in pregnancy can lead to significant problems including the baby being born too soon to survive, having immature lungs, and serious infections. Preterm babies are overall more likely to be ill and to suffer from long-term disabilities, if they do survive. The survival of babies affected by PPROM is related to how early it occurs in the pregnancy and if an infection occurs. In some circumstances, the waters may reseal themselves. This is more likely to occur when no infection is present. Several treatments to reseal the membranes have been tried, with varying success. Resealing has been attempted by: a) injecting clotting factors and other medicines in to the hole in the womb to create a patch over the area that is leaking; b) taking tablets that may stimulate the body's immune system to mend the area where the seal has broken; c) placing a sponge over the hole in the waters; d) placing a seal over the neck of the womb to stop fluid leaking out and prevent infection. Our study is important because finding a successful treatment for PPROM may reduce the potential complications that may happen to the mother and baby such as preterm birth (being born before 37 weeks' gestation) and infections. What did we find? In our study we assessed the different techniques used for resealing the waters. We aimed to compare the survival of babies affected with this condition before and after birth and look at the rates of complications in both the babies and mothers. We searched for trials (30 May 2016) and found two studies that compared treatments for resealing the membranes after they had broken. These trials involved 141 women in total and compared two completely different modes of treatment. One trial compared the use of an oral immunological membrane sealant to stimulate the body's immune system to mend the area where the seal has broken and the other trial placed a mechanical sealing device over the cervix (neck of the womb) to stop fluid leaking. Unfortunately, neither trial provided any data relating to death of the baby within the womb or in the first 28 days of life (perinatal mortality). There was limited evidence to suggest that oral immunological membrane sealant was associated with a fewer babies being before 37 weeks' gestation and a reduction in the number of babies that died within the first 28 days. However, these results are based on  very low-quality evidence  from one small trial (with data from 94 women) that we judged to be at a high risk of bias. There was no clear difference between the mechanical sealing device group and the control group in relation to the number of babies who contracted a serious infection (neonatal sepsis) or chorioamnionitis (a bacterial infection that causes inflammation of the membranes surrounding the baby in the womb). Although these results are based on  very low-quality evidence  from one small trial (involving 35 women) judged to be at a high risk of bias. What does this mean? Overall, our question remains unanswered - we do not have enough data to fully evaluate sealing procedures for PPROM. This review demonstrates the lack of research in this area regarding the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments for PPROM. We recommend that more research is needed to look at the different techniques for sealing broken waters and that this research should focus on the effectiveness of the treatment in improving overall outcomes. The safety of the treatments to both mother and baby must be further evaluated before sealing techniques can be recommended to prevent adverse outcomes.},

  abstract = {Hemostatic resuscitation is currently considered a standard of care for the management of life-threatening hemorrhage, but in some critical settings the access to high quantities of blood components is problematic. Whole blood (WB) transfusion has been proposed as an alternative modality for hemostatic resuscitation of traumatic major bleeding. To assess the efficacy and safety of WB in trauma-associated massive bleeding, we performed a systematic review of the literature. We selected studies comparing WB transfusions to transfusion of blood components (COMP) in massive trauma bleeding; both randomized clinical trial (RCT) and observational studies were considered. The outcomes were mortality (30-day/in-hospital and 24-h mortality) and adverse events/transfusion reactions. The effect sizes were crude odds ratio (OR), adjusted OR and hazard ratio (HR). The methodological quality of studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs, and the ROBIN-1 tool for observational studies. The overall quality of the available evidence was assessed with the GRADE system. One RCT (2 reports) and 6 cohort studies were included (3642 adult patients; 675 receiving WB, 2967 receiving COMP). Three studies were conducted in military setting, and 4 in civilian setting. In the overall analysis, 30-day/in-hospital and 24-h mortality did not differ significantly between groups (very low quality of the evidence due to high risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency). After adjustment for baseline covariates in three cohort studies, the OR for mortality was significantly lower in WB recipients compared to COMP (OR 0.22; 95\% CIs 0.10/0.45) (moderate grade of evidence). Adverse events and transfusion reactions were overlooked and not consistently reported. The available evidence does not allow to draw definite conclusions on the short-term and long-term efficacy and safety of WB transfusion compared to COMP transfusion. Further well designed research is needed.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Foreign body ingestion is a common clinical presentation with less than 1\% of the cases requiring surgical intervention. In this report, we present  a rare case of razor blades lodged in the appendix as a result of intentional  ingestion. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 25\,year old male prisoner presented to our  hospital with persistent right iliac fossa pain after razor blade ingestion.  After 5\,days of conservative management, there was no sign of transition on  serial X-Rays. Laparoscopy with intraoperative image intensification confirmed  the presence of the razor blades in the appendix and appendicectomy was  subsequently performed without complications. DISCUSSION: Most ingested objected  with diameter less than 2.5\,cm and length less than 6\,cm can pass through the  gastrointestinal tract spontaneously in less than one week. The entry of foreign  objects into the appendix is thought to be due to relative low motility of the  caecum, the dependent position of the appendix and the size of the appendiceal  orifice. Radiographic localisation to the appendiceal lumen was complicated by  metallic artefact, but was consistent with failure to transit. Appendicectomy was  felt to be the safest mode of retrieval. CONCLUSION: Ingested foreign body lodged  in the appendix is a rare event. Once the exact location is confirmed, a simple  laparoscopic appendicectomy can be performed to facilitate the removal.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Foreign body ingestion is a common pediatric problem. Coins are by far the most common ingested foreign bodies. When ingested coins become lodged in  the esophagus, they may cause serious complications if they are not removed in a  timely manner. Endoscopic removal is the preferred treatment in many pediatric  centers as its safety and effectiveness are well established. OBJECTIVES: We  performed this study to evaluate safety and effectiveness of an alternative  method of managing esophageal coins, using bougienage technique. METHODS:  Previously healthy children presenting to the local emergency room with  uncomplicated, witnessed coin ingestion of less than 24 hours duration were  prospectively recruited with an intent-to-treat analysis. A single oral passage  of a Hurst bougie dilator was performed by a gastroenterologist to dislodge the  esophageal coin into the stomach. If bougienage was successful (x-ray showing  coin in the stomach), patients were discharged and instructions were given for  monitoring stools until passage of the coin through anus was confirmed. If  bougienage was unsuccessful, the child developed symptoms at any time or if a  coin remained intragastric for 4 weeks, endoscopic removal was planned. Children  whose parents declined to participate in the bougienage treatment received the  standard endoscopic removal and their hospital records were used as controls.  RESULTS: A total of 10 children were enrolled in this study, with a mean age of  3.2 years (11 mo to 10 y), 6 boys and 4 girls. All received little or no  sedation. Nine children (90\%) were successfully treated using bougienage, all of  whom spontaneously passed the ingested coins, with a mean duration of 2.6 days (1  to 7 d) without subsequent intervention. A single case failed bougienage and  underwent endoscopic removal. Three children declined bougienage treatment and  underwent endoscopic removal. There were no reported minor or major adverse  events with any of our cases. The mean health care cost for the hospital visit  for bougienage treatment was \$1210, compared with \$3100 for the endoscopic  removal (P{$<$}0.001). Furthermore, the mean time spent in the hospital from  diagnosis to discharge was 2 hours for bougienage-treated patients compared with  8 hours for endoscopic treatment (P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bougienage of impacted  esophageal coins is an effective, safe, and more economic treatment modality for  selected pediatric patients with uncomplicated coin ingestion. This simple  technique may provide a valuable tool to emergency room physicians or primary  care doctors especially when endoscopy is not readily available.},

  abstract = {Background: Intentional ingestion of foreign objects (IIFO) is common in the incarcerated population. This study was undertaken in order to better define clinical patterns of IIFO among prisoners. We sought to determine factors associated with the need for endoscopic and surgical therapy for IIFO. Methods: After obtaining permission to conduct IIFO research in incarcerated populations, study patients were identified by ICD-9 codes. Patient charts were reviewed for demographics; past medical history; IIFO characteristics; and diagnostic, endoscopic, and surgical findings. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using statistical software. Results: Thirty patients with 141 episodes of IIFO were identified. The mean number of ingested items per episode was 4.60. Endoscopy was performed in 97 of 141 IIFO instances, with failure to retrieve the ingested object in 21 of 97 cases (22\%). Eleven instances (7.8\%) required surgical intervention. On multivariate analyses, hospital admission was associated with elevated white blood cell count (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, P {$<$} 0.05) and number of items ingested (OR 1.3, P {$<$} 0.05). The need for endoscopy was independently associated with ingestion of multiple objects (OR 3.3, P {$<$} 0.05) and elevated white blood cell count (OR 1.3, P {$<$} 0.05). Surgical therapy was significantly associated with elevated white blood cell count (OR 1.6, P {$<$} 0.01) and with increasing number of ingested items (OR 1.07 per item, P {$<$} 0.05). Endoscopy is associated with significantly lower odds of surgery (OR 0.13, P {$<$} 0.01). Conclusions: Intentional ingestion of foreign objects continues to pose a significant human and economic burden. The need for admission or therapy is frequently associated with leukocytosis. Further investigation is warranted into resource-appropriate triage of patients who present with IIFO.},

Secondary to foreign bodies that migrate to the pancreas, complications with high mortality such as pancreatitis, pseudoaneurysm, and pancreas abscess can be seen. Thus, for this patient group, diagnostic laparoscopy is recommended, considering its advantages of decreased postoperative pain, decreased wound infection, and faster recovery time.

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Alveolar osteitis (dry socket) is a complication of dental extractions more often involving mandibular molar teeth. It is associated with severe pain developing 2 to 3 days postoperatively with or without halitosis, a socket that may be partially or totally devoid of a blood clot, and increased postoperative visits. This is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2012.  Objectives To assess the effects of local interventions used for the prevention and treatment of alveolar osteitis (dry socket) following tooth extraction. Search methods An Information Specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 28 September 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of adults over 18 years of age who were having permanent teeth extracted or who had developed dry socket postextraction. We included studies with any type of local intervention used for the prevention or treatment of dry socket, compared to a different local intervention, placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies reporting on systemic use of antibiotics or the use of surgical techniques because these interventions are evaluated in separate Cochrane Reviews. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We followed Cochrane statistical guidelines and reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and calculated 95\% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects models. For some of the split-mouth studies with sparse data, it was not possible to calculate RR so we calculated the exact odds ratio (OR) instead. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the body of evidence. Main results We included 49 trials with 6771 participants; 39 trials (with 6219 participants) investigated prevention of dry socket and 10 studies (with 552 participants) looked at the treatment of dry socket. 16 studies were at high risk of bias, 30 studies at unclear risk of bias, and 3 studies at low risk of bias. Chlorhexidine in the prevention of dry socket When compared to placebo, rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthrinses (0.12\% and 0.2\% concentrations) both before and 24 hours after extraction(s) substantially reduced the risk of developing dry socket with an OR of 0.38 (95\% CI 0.25 to 0.58; P {$<$} 0.00001; 6 trials, 1547 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The prevalence of dry socket varies from 1\% to 5\% in routine dental extractions to upwards of 30\% in surgically extracted third molars. The number of patients needed to be treated (NNT) with chlorhexidine rinse to prevent one patient having dry socket was 162 (95\% CI 155 to 240), 33 (95\% CI 27 to 49), and 7 (95\% CI 5 to 10) for control prevalence of dry socket 0.01, 0.05, and 0.30 respectively.  Compared to placebo, placing chlorhexidine gel intrasocket after extractions reduced the odds of developing a dry socket by 58\% with an OR of 0.44 (95\% CI 0.27 to 0.71; P = 0.0008; 7 trials, 753 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The NNT with chlorhexidine gel (0.2\%) to prevent one patient developing dry socket was 180 (95\% CI 137 to 347), 37 (95\% CI 28 to 72), and 7 (95\% CI 5 to 15) for control prevalence of dry socket of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.30 respectively. Compared to chlorhexidine rinse (0.12\%), placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2\%) intrasocket after extractions was not superior in reducing the risk of dry socket (RR 0.74, 95\% CI 0.46 to 1.20; P = 0.22; 2 trials, 383 participants; low-certainty evidence).  The present review found some evidence for the association of minor adverse reactions with use of 0.12\%, 0.2\% chlorhexidine mouthrinses (alteration in taste, staining of teeth, stomatitis) though most studies were not designed explicitly to detect the presence of hypersensitivity reactions to mouthwash as part of the study protocol. No adverse events were reported in relation to the use of 0.2\% chlorhexidine gel placed directly into a socket. Platelet rich plasma in the prevention of dry socket  Compared to placebo, placing platelet rich plasma after extractions was not superior in reducing the risk of having a dry socket (RR 0.51, 95\% CI 0.19 to 1.33; P = 0.17; 2 studies, 127 participants; very low-certainty evidence).  A further 21 intrasocket interventions to prevent dry socket were each evaluated in single studies, and there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects. Zinc oxide eugenol versus Alvogyl in the treatment of dry socket Two studies, with 80 participants, showed that Alvogyl (old formulation) is more effective than zinc oxide eugenol at reducing pain at day 7 (mean difference (MD) -1.40, 95\% CI -1.75 to -1.04; P {$<$} 0.00001; 2 studies, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence) A further nine interventions for the treatment of dry socket were evaluated in single studies, providing insufficient evidence to determine their effects. Authors' conclusions Tooth extractions are generally undertaken by dentists for a variety of reasons, however, all but five studies included in the present review included participants undergoing extraction of third molars, most of which were undertaken by oral surgeons. There is moderate-certainty evidence that rinsing with chlorhexidine (0.12\% and 0.2\%) or placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2\%) in the sockets of extracted teeth, probably results in a reduction in dry socket. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of the other 21 preventative interventions each evaluated in single studies. There was limited evidence of very low certainty that Alvogyl (old formulation) may reduce pain at day 7 in patients with dry socket when compared to zinc oxide eugenol.  Plain language summary What treatments can be used to prevent and treat alveolar osteitis (dry socket)?  Key messages - Rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthwash before a dental extraction or beginning 24 hours after may help to prevent a dry socket. - Placing a chlorhexidine gel directly into the socket immediately after tooth extraction may help to prevent a dry socket. - Chlorhexidine rinses cause some minor adverse (unwanted) effects; chlorhexidine intrasocket gels do not appear to cause adverse effects. - Alvogyl reduces the pain of a dry socket when compared to zinc oxide eugenol, but the evidence for this is very uncertain. - Alvogyl does not appear to cause unwanted effects. - We need future studies to strengthen the evidence and investigate the best ways to prevent and treat dry socket in all teeth. What is dry socket? Dry socket is a painful condition that sometimes arises after a tooth has been extracted and is more likely to occur following extraction of wisdom teeth in the lower jaw. What causes dry socket? It is thought to be linked to the loss of some or all of the blood clot that forms at the bottom of a tooth socket after a tooth is taken out. How can we prevent dry socket? An option for prevention of dry socket is to reduce debris and the bacterial load in the mouth, though dry socket is not bacterial in origin. People with poor oral hygiene (food debris and plaque) are at greater risk of dry socket. Improved oral hygiene and rinsing before a dental extraction or beginning 24 hours after may reduce the likelihood of dry socket. How can we treat dry socket ? Options for treating dry socket largely focus on reducing pain locally around the tooth extraction site by placing an obtundent (a soothing medicated dressing). What did we want to find out ? We wanted to find out if antiseptic rinses, gels, or healing patches could help to prevent dry socket. We also wanted to find out if placing a medicated dressing could treat a dry socket and whether any unwanted side effects were produced. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared antiseptic rinses or intrasocket gels with a placebo (dummy) rinse or nothing and a placebo (dummy) intrasocket gel or nothing. To find the best way to treat dry socket we searched for studies that compared different soothing agents with a placebo (dummy) with other soothing agents or with nothing. We compared the results of the studies and summarised the findings. We made an assessment of our confidence in the evidence based on the design of the study and the number of patients recruited. What did we find? We identified 49 trials; 39 trials (6219 participants) investigated prevention of dry socket and 10 trials (552 participants) investigated the treatment of dry socket. We found that: - rinsing both before and after tooth extraction (commencing 24 hours after extraction) with chlorhexidine gluconate rinse (at 0.12\% and 0.2\% strength) probably results in a reduction in dry socket; - placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2\% strength) in the socket of an extracted tooth probably results in a reduction in dry socket; - chlorhexidine rinses and gels are equally effective at reducing dry socket, but the evidence for this comparison is very uncertain; - chlorhexidine rinses produced some minor unwanted effects; chlorhexidine intrasocket gels appeared to produce no unwanted effects; - there was a small amount of evidence of very low certainty from two studies that Alvogyl (old formulation) may reduce pain at day 7 in patients with dry socket when compared to zinc oxide eugenol. This evidence relates to the old formulation of Alvogyl which is no longer available. It should be noted that the formulation of Alvogyl has changed, it is now called Alveogyl.  Tooth extractions are generally undertaken by dentists for a variety of reasons, however, all but five studies included in the present review included participants undergoing extraction of third molars, most of which were undertaken by oral surgeons.  What are the limitations of the evidence? The main limitation of the evidence are that studies: - reported mostly on tooth extractions involving lower wisdom teeth; - were undertaken in ways that introduced errors in the conduct of the study leading to errors in the results; and - produced imprecise results when they were combined. Due to these errors we have some confidence in the results relating to chlorhexidine rinses and gels but further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. How up to date is this evidence? The search for existing studies was completed by 28 September 2021.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Both dopamine and norepinephrine are recommended as first-line vasopressor agents in the treatment of shock. There is a continuing controversy about whether one agent is superior to the other. METHODS In this multicenter, randomized trial, we assigned patients with shock to receive either dopamine or norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor therapy to restore and maintain blood pressure. When blood pressure could not be maintained with a dose of 20 {$\mu$}g per kilogram of body weight per minute for dopamine or a dose of 0.19 {$\mu$}g per kilogram per minute for norepinephrine, open-label norepinephrine, epinephrine, or vasopressin could be added. The primary outcome was the rate of death at 28 days after randomization; secondary end points included the number of days without need for organ support and the occurrence of adverse events. RESULTS The trial included 1679 patients, of whom 858 were assigned to dopamine and 821 to norepinephrine. The baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of death at 28 days (52.5\% in the dopamine group and 48.5\% in the norepinephrine group; odds ratio with dopamine, 1.17; 95\% confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.42; P\,=\,0.10). However, there were more arrhythmic events among the patients treated with dopamine than among those treated with norepinephrine (207 events [24.1\%] vs. 102 events [12.4\%], P{$<$}0.001). A subgroup analysis showed that dopamine, as compared with norepinephrine, was associated with an increased rate of death at 28 days among the 280 patients with cardiogenic shock but not among the 1044 patients with septic shock or the 263 with hypovolemic shock (P\,=\,0.03 for cardiogenic shock, P\,=\,0.19 for septic shock, and P\,=\,0.84 for hypovolemic shock, in Kaplan--Meier analyses).

  abstract = {Background: Syncope remains challenging for Emergency Department (ED) physicians due to difficulties in assessing the risk of future adverse outcomes. The aim of this meta-analysis is to establish the incidence and etiology of adverse outcomes as well as the predictors, in patients presenting with syncope to the ED. Methods: A systematic electronic literature review was performed looking for eligible studies published between 1990 and 2010. Studies reporting multivariate predictors of adverse outcomes in patients presenting with syncope to the ED were included and pooled, when appropriate, using a random-effect method. Adverse events were defined as `incidence of death, or of hospitalization and interventional procedures because of arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease or valvular heart disease'. Results: 11 studies were included. Pooled analysis showed 42\% (CI 95\%; 32--52) of patients were admitted to hospital. Risk of death was 4.4\% (CI 95\%; 3.1--5.1) and 1.1\% (CI 95\%; 0.7--1.5) had a cardiovascular etiology. One third of patients were discharged without a diagnosis, while the most frequent diagnosis was `situational, orthostatic or vasavagal syncope' in 29\% (CI 95\%; 12--47). 10.4\% (CI 95\%; 7.8--16) was diagnosed with heart disease, the most frequent type being bradyarrhythmia, 4.8\% (CI 95\%; 2.2--6.4) and tachyarrhythmia 2.6\% (CI 95\%; 1.1--3.1). Palpitations preceding syncope, exertional syncope, a history consistent of heart failure or ischemic heart disease, and evidence of bleeding were the most powerful predictors of an adverse outcome. Conclusion: Syncope carries a high risk of death, mainly related to cardiovascular disease. This large study which has established the most powerful predictors of adverse outcomes, may enable care and resources to be better focused at high risk patients.},

A high mortality rate has been reported among psychotic patients due to the number and bizarreness of the objects and the difficulty of making a firm diagnosis of such patients. The nonpsychotic patient who has swallowed a foreign body as a manipulative gesture is a type seen among prison populations. Diagnosis is facilitated by the intention of obtaining secondary gain. There is a marked tendency to repeat the action. Prison population manipulative swallowers are often uncooperative, demanding or refusing surgery at times. Their behavior makes patient management deviate from the ideal of expectant treatment. (18 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Background: Prehospital cardiac arrest associated with trauma almost always results in death. A case of survival after prehospital thoracotomy was published in 1994 and several others have followed. This article describes the result of prehospital thoracotomy in a physician-led system for patients with stab wounds to the chest who suffered cardiac arrest on scene. Methods: A 15-year retrospective prehospital trauma database review identified victims of stab wounds to the chest who suffered cardiac arrest on scene and had thoracotomy performed according to local standard operating procedures. Results: Overall, 71 patients met inclusion criteria. Thirteen patients (18\%) survived to hospital discharge. Neurologic outcome was good in 11 patients and poor in 2. Presenting cardiac rhythm was asystole in four patients, pulseless electrical activity in five, and unrecorded in the remaining four. All survivors had cardiac tamponade. The medical team was present at the time of cardiac arrest for six survivors (good neurologic outcome): arrived in the first 5 minutes after arrest in three patients (all good neurologic outcome), arrived 5 minutes to 10 minutes after arrest in two patients (one poor neurologic outcome), and in one patient (poor neurologic outcome) the period was unknown. Of the survivors, seven thoracotomies were performed by emergency physicians and six by anesthesiologists. Conclusions: Prehospital thoracotomy is a well-established procedure in this physician-led prehospital service. Results from this and other similar systems suggest that when performed for the subgroup of patients described, significant numbers of survivors with good neurologic outcome can be expected.},

  abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the effect of paramedic rapid sequence intubation (RSI) on outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Methods: Adult major trauma victims were prospectively enrolled over two years using the following inclusion criteria: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 3-- 8, suspected head injury by mechanism or physical examination, transport time {$>$} 10,`` and inability to intubate without RSI. Midazolam and succinylcholine were administered before laryngoscopy; rocuronium was given after tube placement was confirmed using physical examination, capnometry, syringe aspiration, and pulse oximetry. The Combitube was used as a salvage airway device. For this analysis, trial patients were excluded for absence of a head injury (Head/Neck AIS score {$<$} 2), failure to fulfill major trauma outcome study criteria, unsuccessful intubation or Combitube insertion, or death in the field or in the resuscitation suite within 30'' of arrival. Each study patient was hand matched to three nonintubated historical controls from our trauma registry using the following parameters: age, sex, mechanism of injury, trauma center, and AIS score for each body system. Controls were excluded for Head/Neck AIS defined by a c-spine injury or death in the field or in the resuscitation suite within 30`` of arrival. ␹2, odds ratios, and logistic regression were used to investigate the impact of RSI on the primary outcome measures of mortality and incidence of a ''good outcome,`` defined as discharge to home, rehabilitation, psychiatric facility, jail, or signing out against medical advice. Results: A total of 209 trial patients were hand matched to 627 controls. The groups were similar with regard to all matching parameters, admission vital signs, frequency of specific head injury diagnoses, and incidence of invasive procedures. Mortality was significantly increased in the trial cohort versus controls for all patients (33.0\% versus 24.2\%, p {$<$} 0.05) and in those with Head/Neck AIS scores of 3 or greater (41.1\% versus 30.3\%, p {$<$} 0.05). The incidence of a ``good outcome'' was lower in the trial cohort versus controls (45.5\% versus 57.9\%, p {$<$} 0.01). Factors that may have contributed to the increase in mortality include transient hypoxia, inadvertent hyperventilation, and longer scene times associated with the RSI procedure. Conclusion: Paramedic RSI protocols to facilitate intubation of head-injured patients were associated with an increase in mortality and decrease in good outcomes versus matched historical controls.},

The place for microcirculation-targeted therapy is debated as well as the use of alternative techniques (blood purification) and therapies (vitamin C). The implications of hemodynamic alterations on antibiotic doses is discussed. Finally, the spe-cific challenges in low- and middle-income countries are addressed. Ongoing trials address some of these challenges, but many uncertainties will remain, and individualized therapies based on careful clinical assessment will continue to be essential to optimizing the care of patients with septic shock.},

No similar case of internal injuries following  unintentional ingestion of a barbecue grill cleaning brush bristle has been  reported. A 58-year-old Caucasian male with no significant history presented with  complaint of halitosis, not improving after oral care and dental hygiene  measures. He denied any other symptoms. After ruling out oral causes of  halitosis, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, which revealed a black  wire-shaped metallic FB embedded in the duodenum. The FB was identified as a  silver metallic flexible wire resembling the bristle of a barbecue grill cleaning  brush. The halitosis resolved completely within 3 weeks of the removal of the FB.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of duodenal impaction of a  barbecue grill cleaning brush bristle atypically presenting with halitosis.  Physicians' awareness of this potential injury from grill cleaning brush bristles  would lead to a quick diagnosis after a focused history. Also avid grillers must  be made aware of this potential hazard and should be encouraged to carefully  examine the barbecue grill surface for any remnant bristle of the grill cleaning  brush. Appropriate history taking, considering GI causes as potentially inducing  halitosis, and an awareness of this entity among providers are important to  facilitate prompt diagnoses and prevent major adverse outcomes.},

Methods: This was an interventional study on adult patients, who were referred with chief complaint of undifferentiated acute dyspnea to the ED of Namazi hospital, the largest referral center in southern Iran. The intervention was LuCUS protocol, which was performed by Emergency Physicians (EPs) at the bedside. All patients' files were reviewed separately by two independent specialists, who were blinded to LuCUS results for final diagnosis as gold standard, then the results of LuCUS were compared with it. All data were analyzed and diagnostic tests were calculated ({$\alpha$} = 0.05). Results: In 100 patients enrolled in the study, 28\% had the final diagnosis as AHF. The LuCUS protocol had the sensitivity of 64\% (95\%CI, 44\%--81\%), specificity of 97\% (95\%CI, 90\%--100\%), positive predicative value of 90\% (95\%CI, 69\%--97\%), negative predicative value of 88\% (95\%CI, 81\%--92\%), positive likelihood ratio of 23.14 (95\%CI, 5.74--93.3), negative likelihood ratio of 0.37 (95\%CI, 0.22--0.6), and accuracy of 88\% (95\%CI, 80\%--94\%). Conclusion: LuCUS protocol can be used by EPs as a practical tool to differentiate the cardiac and non-cardiac etiologies of acute dyspnea, specifically AHF, as it is more accurate than clinical diagnosis by itself. Hence, it is recommend that while conducting further studies in order to achieve more generalizable results, EPs can employ it alongside their clinical evaluations to have a faster and more accurate diagnosis.},

Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: ED of 14 general hospitals. Patients: 516 consecutive patients with unexplained syncope. Interventions: Subjects underwent a diagnostic evaluation on adherence to Guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology. The clinical features of syncope were analysed using a standard 52-item form. In a validation cohort of 260 patients the predictive value of symptoms/ signs was evaluated, a point score was developed and then validated in a cohort of 256 other patients. Main outcome measurements: Diagnosis of cardiac syncope, mortality. Results: Abnormal ECG and/or heart disease, palpitations before syncope, syncope during effort or in supine position, absence of autonomic prodromes and absence of predisposing and/or precipitating factors were found to be predictors of cardiac syncope. To each variable a score from +4 to --1 was assigned to the magnitude of regression coefficient. A score {$>$}3 identified cardiac syncope with a sensitivity of 95\%/92\% and a specificity of 61\%/69\% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. During follow-up (mean (SD) 614 (73) days) patients with score {$>$}3 had a higher total mortality than patients with a score ,3 both in the derivation (17\% vs 3\%; p,0.001) and in the validation cohort (21\% vs 2\%; p,0.001). Conclusions: A simple score derived from clinical history can be usefully employed for the triage and management of patients with syncope in an ED.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Safety pin ingestion is common in some regions of the world and may lead to severe morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to present some  practical suggestions for ingested safety pins using an accompanying algorithm,  presented for the first time in the literature to the best of our knowledge.  METHODS: Twenty children with ingested safety pins during a 4-year period were  retrospectively included in the study. RESULTS: Median age of patients was 9.5  months (interquartile range, 6.3-14 months), and 70\% were girls. On endoscopic  examination, safety pins were observed in the stomach (25\%), duodenal bulb (20\%),  upper esophagus (15\%), middle esophagus (10\%), and second part of the duodenum  (10\%) but were not observed in 20\% of the cases. Safety pins were removed using  endoscopy in 15 cases (75\%). In four cases (20\%), no safety pin was observed on  endoscopic examination. In one case (5\%) involving a 6-month-old infant, the  safety pin could not be removed although it was observed using endoscopy. No  surgical intervention was needed for any patient. No complications such as  perforation or deaths developed, except for erosions, due to the foreign body  removal procedure. CONCLUSION: Safety pins are easily removed endoscopically. The  best option is to remove the safety pin using endoscopy while it is still in the  esophagus and stomach. For this reason, endoscopic procedures should be performed  as soon as possible in children who have ingested safety pins.},

  abstract = {Activation of arginine--vasopressin is one of the hormonal responses to face vasodilation-related hypotension. Released from the post-pituitary gland, vasopressin induces vasoconstriction through the activation of V1a receptors located on vascular smooth muscle cells. Due to its non-selective receptor affinity arginine--vasopressin also activates V2 (located on renal tubular cells of collecting ducts) and V1b (located in the anterior pituitary and in the pancreas) receptors, thereby potentially promoting undesired side effects such as anti-diuresis, procoagulant properties due to release of the von Willebrand's factor and platelet activation. Finally, it also cross-activates oxytocin receptors. During septic shock, vasopressin plasma levels were reported to be lower than expected, and a hypersensitivity to its vasopressor effect is reported in such situation. Terlipressin and selepressin are synthetic vasopressin analogues with a higher affinity for the V1 receptor, and, hence, potentially less side effects. In this narrative review, we present the current knowledge of the rationale, benefits and risks of vasopressin use in the setting of septic shock and vasoplegic shock following cardiac surgery. Clearly, vasopressin administration allows reducing norepinephrine requirements, but so far, no improvement of survival was reported and side effects are frequent, particularly ischaemic events. Finally, we will discuss the current indications for vasopressin and its agonists in the setting of septic shock, and the remaining unresolved questions.},

  abstract = {Objective: To establish whether UK emergency physicians could reliably perform focused ultrasound of the abdominal aorta in patients with suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in the emergency department of a tertiary level UK teaching hospital. All patients who underwent an abdominal aortic ultrasound by an emergency physician during a 12 month period from January to December 2005 were included. The principle outcomes were presence of an AAA (external wall diameter .3 cm) or death from ruptured AAA. Outcome data were obtained from paper and electronic patient records and primary care telephone follow up. Results: 120 focused ultrasound scans looking for AAA were performed by 19 different UK emergency physicians of various grades. Of the 120 scans, 26 (22\%) were positive for an AAA, of which 17 cases represented a new diagnosis. Ruptured aneurysms represented 46\% (12/26) of all positive scans, of which four patients underwent emergency repair. In the remaining 14 patients the AAA was an incidental finding that was not the reason for their presentation to the emergency department. Emergency ultrasound had a sensitivity of 96.3\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 81.0\% to 99.9\%); a specificity of 100\% (95\% CI 91.8\% to 100\%); a negative predictive value of 98.6\% (95\% CI 88.0\% to 99.9\%); and positive predictive value of 100\% (95\% CI 86.8\% to 100\%) for the detection of AAA. Conclusion: Emergency ultrasound scanning by UK emergency physicians has high sensitivity and specificity for identifying AAA, consistent with international experience.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mortality of trauma patients requiring massive transfusion to treat hemorrhagic shock approaches 17\% at 24 hours and 26\% at 30 days. The use of stored RBCs is limited to less than 42 days, so older RBCs are delivered first to rapidly bleeding trauma patients. Patients who receive a greater quantity of older RBCs may have a higher risk for mortality. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Characterizing blood age exposure requires accounting for the age of each RBC unit and the quantity of transfused units. To address this challenge, a novel Scalar Age of Blood Index (SBI) that represents the relative distribution of RBCs received is introduced and applied to a secondary analysis of the Pragmatic, Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) randomized controlled trial (NCT01545232, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01545232). The effect of the SBI is assessed on the primary PROPPR outcome, 24-hour and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: The distributions of blood storage ages successfully maps to a parameter (SBI) that fully defines the blood age curve for each patient. SBI was a significant predictor of 24-hour and 30-day mortality in an adjusted model that had strong predictive ability (odds ratio, 1.15 [1.01-1.29], p = 0.029, C-statistic, 0.81; odds ratio, 1.14 [1.02-1.28], p = 0.019, C-statistic, 0.88, respectively). CONCLUSION: SBI is a simple scalar metric of blood age that accounts for the relative distribution of RBCs among age categories. Transfusion of older RBCs is associated with 24-hour and 30-day mortality, after adjustment for total units and clinical covariates.},

Music therapy is characterized by personally tailored music interventions initiated by a trained and qualified music therapist, which distinguishes music therapy from other music interventions, such as `music medicine', which concerns mainly music listening interventions offered by healthcare professionals. To summarize the growing body of empirical research on music therapy, a multilevel meta-analysis, containing 47 studies, 76 effect sizes and 2.747 participants, was performed to assess the strength of the effects of music therapy on both physiological and psychological stress-related outcomes, and to test potential moderators of the intervention effects. Results showed that music therapy showed an overall medium-to-large effect on stress-related outcomes (d = .723, [.51--.94]). Larger effects were found for clinical controlled trials (CCT) compared to randomized controlled trials (RCT), waiting list controls instead of care as usual (CAU) or other stress-reducing interventions, and for studies conducted in Non-Western countries compared to Western countries. Implications for both music therapy and future research are discussed.},

Common oxime based reactivators or nerve antidotes include pralidoxime, obidoxime, HI-6, trimedoxime and methoxime, among which pralidoxime is the only FDA-approved drug. Cephalosporins are {$\beta$}-lactam based antibiotics and serve as widely acclaimed tools in fighting bacterial infections. Oxime based cephalosporins have emerged as an important class of drugs with improved efficacy and a broad spectrum of anti-microbial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Among the several oxime based derivatives, cefuroxime, ceftizoxime, cefpodoxime and cefmenoxime are the FDA approved oxime-based antibiotics.

The ingestion of the foreign body is often  acute and non-intentional. Acute and life-threatening complications include  intestinal perforation or obstruction. Sharp-pointed objects are associated with  an estimated 35\% rate of complications within the gastrointestinal tract prior to  passage and require prompt removal. Endoscopic retrieval is often recommended if  foreign objects have not transited beyond the proximal duodenum. We present a  unique case of a previously healthy 23-year-old male suffering months of  abdominal pain. While the initial presentation and imaging were suspicious for  Crohn's disease, the endoscopic findings were unexpected. Numerous chicken bone  fragments were clustered in the caecum and in the terminal ileum. The distal  terminal ileum was edematous and ulcerated. Subsequent patient history revealed  years of chronic and intentional foreign body consumption with recent onset of  abdominal pain.},

  abstract = {Syncope may be the final common presentation of a number of clinical conditions spanning benign (i.e. neurallymediated syncope) to life-threatening diseases (i.e. cardiac syncope). Hospitalization rate after a syncopal episode is high. An effective risk stratification is crucial to identify patients at risk of poor prognosis in the short term period to avoid unnecessary hospital admissions. The decision to admit or discharge a syncope patient from the ED is often based on the physician's clinical judgment. In recent years, several prognostic tools (i.e. clinical prediction rules and risk scores) have been developed to provide emergency physicians with accurate guidelines for hospital admission. At present, there are no compelling evidence that prognostic tools perform better than physician's clinical judgment in assessing the short-term outcome of syncope. However, the risk factors characterizing clinical prediction rules and risk scores may be profitably used by emergency doctors in their decision making, specifically whenever a syncope patient has to be discharged from ED or admitted to hospital. Patients with syncope of undetermined etiology, who are characterized by an intermediate-high risk profile after the initial evaluation, should be monitored in the ED. Indeed, data suggest that the 48 h following syncope are at the highest risk for major adverse events. A new tool for syncope management is represented by the Syncope Unit in the ED or in an outpatient setting. Syncope Unit may reduce hospitalization and length of hospital stay. However, further studies are needed to clarify whether syncope patients' prognosis can be also improved.},

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious problem that causes high morbidity and mortality around the world. Currently, no reliable biomarkers are used to assess the severity and predict the recovery. Many protein biomarkers were extensively studied for diagnosis and prognosis of different TBI severities such as S-100{$\beta$}, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), neurofilament light chain (NFL), cleaved tau protein (C-tau), and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1). However, none of these candidates is currently used in the clinical practice, due to relatively low sensitivity, for the diagnosis of mild TBI (mTBI) or mild to moderate TBI (MMTBI) patients who are clinically well and do not have a detectable intracranial pathology on the scans. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are a class of small endogenous molecular regulators, which showed to be altered in different pathologies, including TBI and for this reason, their potential role in diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic applications, is explored. Promising miRNAs such as miR-21, miR-16 or let-7i were identified as suitable candidate biomarkers for TBI and can differentiate mild from severe TBI. Also, they might represent new potential therapeutic targets. Identification of miRNA signature in tissue or biofluids, for several pathological conditions, is now possible thanks to the introduction of new high-throughput technologies such as microarray platform, Nanostring technologies or Next Generation Sequencing. This review has the aim to describe the role of microRNA in TBI and to explore the most commonly used techniques to identify microRNA profile. Understanding the strengths and limitations of the different methods can aid in the practical use of miRNA profiling for diverse clinical applications, including the development of a point-of-care device.},

Attempted suicide may take a variety of forms; those discussed by the authors include sharp force injury, immolation and inhalation, ingestion, hanging, firearm use, jumping from a height, and drowning. Certain radiologic findings are commonly seen in cases of attempted suicide and other self-injurious behaviors. In some cases, especially when the patient is unconscious or is unwilling to provide a history, it may not be apparent that suicide has been attempted until characteristic imaging findings are recognized. Correct identification of suicide attempts on the basis of such findings will ensure that these patients receive appropriate psychiatric treatment. When a suicide attempt is unsuccessful, it is important to be familiar with the complications that may contribute to delayed mortality and morbidity. The radiologist plays an integral role in the acute medical or surgical management of patients who have attempted suicide. In addition, imaging examinations may provide useful forensic information.

  abstract = {Introduction: Intentional swallowing of foreign objects is a relatively rare psychopathological behavior. Adolescents and young adults may carry out this act to hurt themselves or even suicide. Often, most reports related to deliberate swallowing are typically either surgical or gastrointestinal and rarely are found in psychiatric articles; more often, the swallowed foreign objects (80 - 90\%) are disposed of spontaneously, and 10 - 20\% of them require endoscopy for more study and less than 1\% of them need surgery to be removed or its complications. Case Presentation: The presented patient is a 17-year-old girl admitted to the psychosomatic ward of Afzalipour Hospital due to intentional poisoning. During the year before her admission, on three separate occasions, she detached the knife blade from its haft and swallowed it. She underwent laparotomy twice, one time for sigmoid tearing and damage to the left Ovary, to remove the knife and regeneration of the left ovary and sigmoid, and another time to remove the knife in order not to cause damage to her intestines. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in the world in which an ovary has been damaged. Further investigation into her background shows some extent of privation due to her family's long-term economic problems and instability; moreover, sexual and physical abuse was also confirmed. The patient was prescribed clozapine, which decreased her suicidal behavior and attempts noticeably. Conclusions: Swallowing foreign bodies in this patient is interpreted as both self-punishment and punishing others (those who thought they were hurt or may be blamed for their despair or rejection). Intentional swallowing of foreign objects behavior is more resistant than other self-harming activities and may have a worse prognosis. Swallowing foreign objects requires a sophisticated process that, if not correctly managed, may result in serious complications; therefore, appropriate psychiatric counseling and supportive treatment are necessary for these patients. Specific to this patient eliminating the effects of suicide and reaching medical stability with a short admission was necessary. Her suicidal behavior and attempts decreased significantly after starting clozapine treatment. Therefore, clozapine treatment is recommended for patients with suicidal behavior and self-harm. {\copyright} 2023, Brieflands. All rights reserved.},

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose is to identify  the number of inadvertent ingestions of beverage-can stay-tabs by children  recognized at our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical information  system of a children's hospital was searched with key terms to identify cases in  which a witnessed or self-reported inadvertent ingestion of a beverage-can  stay-tab resulted in a radiograph to rule out presence of a foreign body.  Demographics, identification of stay-tab on radiographs, associated  abnormalities, and patient management were reviewed. RESULTS: Nineteen cases of  stay-tab ingestion were identified over 16 years. Mean age of ingesters was 8.5  years with the majority being teenagers and 15 (79\%) {$>$}5 years of age. The  stay-tab could be seen radiographically only in 4 (21\%) cases-all with the  stay-tab identified in the stomach. CONCLUSION: The identification of 19 children  who inadvertently ingested beverage-can stay-tabs at a single children's hospital  suggests that such ingestions still occur. Radiologists should be aware that  stay-tabs are radiographically visible in the minority (21\%) of cases.},

The following study evaluates early, goal-directed therapy (EGDT) in patients with severe sepsis in the absence of hypotension. METHODS: This is a post-hoc anlysis of patients presenting to an urban ED in severe sepsis and septic shock. Patients were included if they had SIRS critieria, lactic acidosis ({$>$} 4 mmol/liter), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) {$>$} 100 mm Hg. Patients were randomized to conventional care (inclusive of central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring) or EGDT. EGDT consisted of 6 hours of resuscitation to goals of CVP between 8--12, MAP between 65--90, and central venous oximetry (ScvO2) greater than 70\%. RESULTS: There was no difference in mean MAP (116.0 mm Hg in the control and 117.6 mm Hg in the treatment group), and there was no difference in APACHE, MODS, and SAPS scores between groups. Forty-eight patients (23 in the control group and 25 in the EGDT group) were analyzed. The mortality was 60.9\% in the control group compared to 20\% in the EGDT group [p {$<$} 0.004]. The mean initial ScvO2 was 45 \% and 44 \% in the control and treatment groups respectively. At six hours, ScvO2 was higher in the EGDT (76\% versus 59\%), whereas the lactate and MODS score were reduced (p {$<$} 0.05). The EGDT group received more total intravenous fluids than the treatment group (p {$<$} 0.05) during the first six hours. At sixty days, mortality in the control (70\%) and in the treament group (24\%) remained significant (p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that patients with severe sepsis accompanied by lactic acidosis may display global tissue hypoxia in the absence of hypotension. Early identification and goal-directed therapy of this subgroup leads to a reduction in morbidity and mortality.},

It has been established that elderly patients on anticoagulation (AC) have an increased risk of splenic injury, but there are little data to show whether AC plays a role in outcomes of splenic injury in the setting of trauma. This is a retrospective cohort study, including 168 adults aged 50 to 79 years who presented as a trauma patient to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital from January 1, 2010, to March 31, 2018. The primary outcome is the management of the splenic injury. Of the 168 patients, 30 were presently taking AC at the time of their injury, and 138 were not taking any AC. These groups were similar in average Injury Severity Score, average grade of splenic injury, and average systolic blood pressure on arrival. However, the groups differed significantly in age and hemoglobin on arrival. We found that patients taking AC at the time of injury underwent splenectomy 23.3 per cent of the time, whereas patients not taking AC underwent splenectomy 11.6 per cent of the time ( P = 0.045). Patients taking AC failed nonoperative management 20 per cent of the time, whereas patients not taking AC failed 0.7 per cent of the time ( P {$<$} 0.05). We found that patients taking AC at the time of their traumatic injury were more likely to undergo splenectomy than patients not taking AC. We also found that patients taking AC were more likely to fail nonoperative management.},

Various investigators have developed clinical risk score and clinical decision rules which are designed to identify the population at highest risk for adverse events. In each of these clinical decision tools, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the key clinical variables used to evaluate the patient. Certain electrocardiographic presentations in the patient with syncope will not only provide a reason for the loss of consciousness but also guide early therapy and disposition in this individual. Bradycardia, atrioventricular block, intraventricular conduction abnormality, and tachydysrhythmia in the appropriate clinical setting provide an answer to the clinician for the sync opal event. Morphologic findings suggesting the range of cardiovascular malady are also encountered; these entities are far ranging, including the various ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities of acute coronary syndrome, ventricular preexcitation as seen in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, Brugada syndrome with the associated tendency for sudden death, prolonged QT interval common in the diverse long QT interval presentations, and right ventricular hypertrophy suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This review discusses the ECG in the patient with syncope. The general use of the 12-lead ECG in this patient population is discussed.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The utility of BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide), NT-proBNP (N-terminal proBNP), and hs-cTn (high-sensitivity cardiac troponin) concentrations for diagnosis and risk-stratification of syncope is incompletely understood. METHODS: We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of BNP, NTproBNP, hs-cTnT, and hs-cTnI concentrations, alone and against those of clinical assessments, in patients {$>$}45-years old presenting with syncope to the emergency department in a prospective diagnostic multicenter study. BNP, NT-proBNP, hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI concentrations were measured in a blinded fashion. Cardiac syncope, as adjudicated by 2 physicians based on all information available including cardiac work-up and 1-year follow-up, was the diagnostic end point. EGSYS (Evaluation of Guidelines in Syncope Study), a syncope-specific diagnostic score, served as the diagnostic comparator. Death and major adverse cardiac events at 30 and 720 days were the prognostic end points. Major adverse cardiac events were defined as death, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, life-threatening arrhythmia, implantation of pacemaker/implantable cardioverter defibrillator, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, stroke/transient ischemic attack, intracranial bleeding, or valvular surgery. ROSE (Risk Stratification of Syncope in the Emergency Department), OESIL (Osservatorio Epidemiologico della Sincope nel Lazio), SFSR (San Fransisco Syncope Rule), and CSRS (Canadian Syncope Risk Score) served as the prognostic comparators. RESULTS: Among 1538 patients eligible for diagnostic assessment, cardiac syncope was the adjudicated diagnosis in 234 patients (15.2\%). BNP, NT-proBNP, hs-cTnT, and hs-cTnI were significantly higher in cardiac syncope versus other causes (P{$<$}0.01). The diagnostic accuracy for cardiac syncope, as quantified by the area under the curve, was 0.77 to 0.78 (95\% CI, 0.74--0.81) for all 4 biomarkers, and superior to EGSYS (area under the curve, 0.68 [95\%-CI 0.65--0.71], P{$<$}0.001). Combining BNP/NTproBNP with hs-cTnT/hs-cTnI further improved diagnostic accuracy to an area under the curve of 0.81 (P{$<$}0.01). BNP, NT-proBNP, hs-cTnT, and hs-cTnI cut-offs, achieving predefined thresholds for sensitivity and specificity (95\%), allowed for rule-in or ruleout of {$\approx$}30\% of all patients. A total of 450 major adverse cardiac events occurred during follow-up. The prognostic accuracy of BNP, NT-proBNP, hs-cTnI, and hs-cTnT for major adverse cardiac events was moderate-to-good (area under the curve, 0.75--0.79), superior to ROSE, OESIL, and SFSR, and inferior to CSRS. CONCLUSIONS: BNP, NT-proBNP, hs-cTnT, and hs-cTnI concentrations provide useful diagnostic and prognostic information in emergency department patients with syncope.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Although epinephrine is essential for successful return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), the influence of this drug on recovery during the post--cardiac arrest phase is debatable. OBJECTIVES This study sought to investigate the relationship between pre-hospital use of epinephrine and functional survival among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) who achieved successful ROSC. METHODS We included all patients with OHCA who achieved successful ROSC admitted to a cardiac arrest center from January 2000 to August 2012. Use of epinephrine was coded as yes/no and by dose (none, 1 mg, 2 to 5 mg, {$>$}5 mg). A favorable discharge outcome was coded using a Cerebral Performance Category 1 or 2. Analyses incorporated multivariable logistic regression, propensity scoring, and matching methods. RESULTS Of the 1,556 eligible patients, 1,134 (73\%) received epinephrine; 194 (17\%) of these patients had a good outcome versus 255 of 422 patients (63\%) in the nontreated group (p {$<$} 0.001). This adverse association of epinephrine was observed regardless of length of resuscitation or in-hospital interventions performed. Compared with patients who did not receive epinephrine, the adjusted odds ratio of intact survival was 0.48 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27 to 0.84) for 1 mg of epinephrine, 0.30 (95\% CI: 0.20 to 0.47) for 2 to 5 mg of epinephrine, and 0.23 (95\% CI: 0.14 to 0.37) for {$>$}5 mg of epinephrine. Delayed administration of epinephrine was associated with worse outcome. CONCLUSIONS In this large cohort of patients who achieved ROSC, pre-hospital use of epinephrine was consistently associated with a lower chance of survival, an association that showed a dose effect and persisted despite postresuscitation interventions. These findings suggest that additional studies to determine if and how epinephrine may provide long-term functional survival benefit are needed.

  abstract = {Background: In a smaller experience, the authors previously demonstrated that end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2) and cardiac output (CO) had a positive association in emergently intubated trauma patients during Emergency Department resuscitation. The aim of this larger study was to reassess the relationship of PetCO2 with CO and identify patient risk-conditions influencing PetCO2 and CO values. Methods: The investigation consists of acutely injured trauma patients requiring emergency tracheal intubation. The study focuses on the prospective collection of PetCO2 and noninvasive CO monitor (NICOM{\textregistered}) values in the Emergency Department. Results: From the end of March through August 2011, 73 patients had 318 pairs of PetCO2 (mm Hg) and CO (L/min.) values. Mean data included Injury Severity Score (ISS) {$\geq$}15 in 65.2\%, Glasgow Coma Score of 6.4 {\textpm} 4.6, hypotension in 19.0\%, and death in 34.3\%. With PetCO2 {$\leq$} 25 (15.9 {\textpm} 8.0), systolic blood pressure was 77.0 {\textpm} 69, CO was 3.2 {\textpm} 3.0, cardiac arrest was 60.4\%, and mortality was 84.9\%. During hypotension, CO was lower with major blood loss (1.9), than without major loss (5.0; P = 0.0008). Low PetCO2 was associated with low CO (P {$<$} 0.0001). Low PetCO2 was associated (P {$\leq$} 0.0012) with ISS {$>$} 20, hypotension, bradycardia, major blood loss, abnormal pupils, cardiac arrest, and death. Low CO was associated (P {$\leq$} 0.0059) with ISS {$>$} 20, hypotension, bradycardia, major blood loss, abnormal pupils, cardiac arrest, and death. Conclusions: During emergency department resuscitation, a decline in PetCO2 correlates with decreases in noninvasive CO in emergently intubated trauma patients. Decreasing PetCO2 and declining NICOM CO are associated with hemodynamic instability, hemorrhage, abnormal pupils, and death. The study indicates that NICOM CO values are clinically discriminate and have physiologic validity.},

  abstract = {Background: Traditional fluid resuscitation strategy in the actively hemorrhaging trauma patient emphasizes maintenance of a normal systolic blood pressure (SBP). One human trial has demonstrated improved survival when fluid resuscitation is restricted, whereas numerous laboratory studies have reported improved survival when resuscitation is directed to a lower than normal pressure. We hypothesized that fluid resuscitation titrated to a lower than normal SBP during the period of active hemorrhage would improve survival in trauma patients presenting to the hospital in hemorrhagic shock. Methods: Patients presenting in hemorrhagic shock were randomized to one of two fluid resuscitation protocols: target SBP {$>$} 100 mm Hg (conventional) or target SBP of 70 mm Hg (low). Fluid therapy was titrated to this endpoint until definitive hemostasis was achieved. Inhospital mortality, injury severity, and probability of survival were determined for each patient. Results: One hundred ten patients were enrolled over 20 months, 55 in each group. The study cohort had a mean age of 31 years, and consisted of 79\% male patients and 51\% penetrating trauma victims. There was a significant difference in SBP observed during the study period (114 mm Hg vs. 100 mm Hg, p {$<$} 0.001). Injury Severity Score (19.65 ؎ 11.8 vs. 23.64 ؎ 13.8, p ؍ 0.11) and the duration of active hemorrhage (2.97 ؎ 1.75 hours vs. 2.57 ؎ 1.46 hours, p ؍ 0.20) were not different between groups. Overall survival was 92.7\%, with four deaths in each group. Conclusion: Titration of initial fluid therapy to a lower than normal SBP during active hemorrhage did not affect mortality in this study. Reasons for the decreased overall mortality and the lack of differentiation between groups likely include improvements in diagnostic and therapeutic technology, the heterogeneous nature of human traumatic injuries, and the imprecision of SBP as a marker for tissue oxygen delivery.},

Method: This was a  retrospective audit of medical and psychological management of a cluster of 12  DFBI incidents over 9 months in 4 young female patients with Borderline  Personality Disorder (BPD). Results: All  four patients knew one another from outpatient psychotherapy programmes. DFBI  was associated with substance use in 5/12 incidents, and with precipitants  (experiencing strong emotions, witnessing self-harm) in 4/12 incidents. Most  DFBI involved sharp objects (razor blades, glass, safety pins). Medical  intervention was initially active (endoscopy/surgery) but progressed to a more  conservative, observational approach. Psychological management was initially  restrictive, but also changed over time to focus on identifying distress,  enhancing coping mechanisms and patient responsibility. Co-ordination of  patient care management involvedintensive liaison (provision of  interdisciplinary support and  education) between medical, surgical and psychiatric teams. Conclusion: Management of DFBI in patients with  BPD requires high levels of interdisciplinary collaboration. In this cluster of  DFBI incidents, effective management was achieved with conservative  medical/surgical methods  (observation) and non-restrictive psychological approaches that enhanced patient self-efficacy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Historically, emergency physicians and trauma surgeons have referred to a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 90 mm Hg as hypotension. Recent evidence from the civilian trauma literature suggests that 110 mm Hg may be more appropriate based on associated acidosis and outcome measures. In this analysis, we sought to determine the relationship between SBP, hypoperfusion, and mortality in the combat casualty. METHODS: A total of 7,180 US military combat casualties from the Joint Theater Trauma Registry from 2002 to 2009 were analyzed with respect to admission SBP, base deficit, and mortality. Base deficit, as a measure of hypoperfusion, and mortality were plotted against 10-mm Hg increments in admission SBP. RESULTS: By plotting SBP, baseline mortality was less than 2\% down to a level of 101 to 110 mm Hg, at which point the slope of the curve increased dramatically to a mortality rate of 45.1\% in casualties with an SBP of 60 mm Hg or less but more than 0 mm Hg. A presenting SBP of 0 mm Hg was associated with 100\% mortality. The data also established a similar effect for base deficit with a sharp increase in the rate of acidosis, which became manifest at an SBP in the range of 90 to 100 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that an SBP of 100 mm Hg or less may be a better and more clinically relevant definition of hypotension and impending hypoperfusion in the combat casualty. One utility of this analysis may be the more expeditious identification of battlefield casualties in need of life-saving interventions such as the need for blood or surgical intervention.},

We hypothesized that the physiologic hypoperfusion and mortality outcomes classically associated with hypotension were manifest at higher SBPs. Methods: A total of 870,634 patient records from the National Trauma Data Bank with emergency department SBP and mortality data were analyzed. Patients (140,898) with severe head injuries, a Glasgow Coma Score {$<$}8, and base deficit (BD) {$<$}5, or missing data items were excluded from analysis. Admission BD, as a measure of metabolic hypoperfusion, was evaluated in 81,134 patients and mortality was plotted against SBP. Results: Baseline mortality was {$<$}2.5\%. However, at 110 mm Hg, the slope of the mortality curve increased such that mortality was 4.8\% greater for every 10-mm Hg decrement in SBP. This effect was consistent to a maximum of 26\% mortality at a SBP of 60 mm Hg. Hypoperfusion (change in the slope of BD curve) began to increase above baseline of 4.5 at a SBP 118 mm Hg. Conclusion: Taking the BD and mortality measurements together, this analysis shows that a SBP {$<$}110 mm Hg is a more clinically relevant definition of hypotension and hypoperfusion than is 90 mm Hg.

  abstract = {It is generally accepted that patients with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) G90 mmHg are in Bshock{\textasciicircum} and have a worse prognosis than patients with a higher SBP. Our objective was to determine if patients with a SBP of 90Y109 mmHg have a worse outcome than patients with a higher SBP following trauma. Patients with gastric, small bowel, and/or diaphragm injuries were identified retrospectively through the trauma database from 1980Y2003. All 2071 patients underwent emergent laparotomy at an urban, level one trauma center. The mortality rate of patients with a SBP of 90Y109 mmHg in the ED or OR was 5\% (17/354) and significantly higher than the 1\% (12/1020) mortality seen in patients with a SBP of 110 mmHg or greater (P G 0.001). The average length of stay of patients with a SBP of 90Y109 mmHg was 15 T 14 days and was significantly longer than the 11 T 11 days seen in patients with a higher SBP. If the SBP was 90Y109 mmHg, the infection rate was 39\% (131/340), and this was significantly higher than the 22\% (219/1016) infection rate seen in patients with higher SBP (P G 0.001). Trauma patients with a systolic blood pressure of 109 mmHg or below are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality following trauma. Patients with a systolic blood pressure of 90Y109 mmHg following trauma should be considered as a special group requiring aggressive resuscitation and surgery. Early operative control of hemorrhage in these patients can reduce mortality and infection.},

OBJECTIVE: to evaluate whether the Identification of Seniors At Risk (ISAR) predicts the clinical outcomes and health and social services costs of older people discharged from acute medical units. DESIGN: an observational cohort study using receiver-operator curve analysis to compare baseline ISAR to an adverse clinical outcome at 90 days (where an adverse outcome was any of death, institutionalisation, hospital readmission, increased dependency in activities of daily living (decrease of 2 or more points on the Barthel ADL Index), reduced mental well-being (increase of 2 or more points on the 12-point General Health Questionnaire) or reduced quality of life (reduction in the EuroQol-5D) and high health and social services costs over 90 days estimated from routine electronic service records. SETTING: two acute medical units in the East Midlands, UK. PARTICIPANTS: a total of 667 patients aged {$\geq$}70 discharged from acute medical units. RESULTS: an adverse outcome at 90 days was observed in 76\% of participants. The ISAR was poor at predicting adverse outcomes (AUC: 0.60, 95\% CI: 0.54-0.65) and fair for health and social care costs (AUC: 0.70, 95\% CI: 0.59-0.81). CONCLUSIONS: adverse outcomes are common in older people discharged from acute medical units in the UK; the poor predictive ability of the ISAR in older people discharged from acute medical units makes it unsuitable as a sole tool in clinical decision-making.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The Canadian C-spine (cervical spine) Rule (CCR) and the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Low-Risk Criteria (NLC) are criteria designed to guide C-spine radiography in trauma patients. It is unclear how these 2 rules compare with young children. Methods: This study retrospectively examined case-matched trauma patients 10 years or younger. Two cohorts were identified-cohort A where C-spine imaging was performed and cohort B where no imaging was conducted. The CCR and NLC criteria were then applied retrospectively to each cohort. Results: Cohort A contained 125 cases and cohort B with 250 cases. Seven patients (3\%) had significant C-spine injuries. In cohort A, NLC criteria could be applied in 108 (86.4\%) of 125 and CCR in 109 (87.2\%) of 125. National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Low-Risk Criteria suggested that 70 (58.3\%) cases required C-spine imaging compared to 93 (76.2\%) by CCR. National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Low-Risk Criteria missed 3 C-spine injuries, and CCR missed one. In cohort B, NLC criteria could be applied in 132 (88\%) of 150 and CCR in 131 (87.3\%) of 150. The NLC criteria identified 8 cases and CCR identified 13 cases that would need C-spine radiographs. Fisher's 2-sided Exact test demonstrated that CCR and NLC predictions were significantly different (P = .002) in both cohorts. The sensitivity of CCR was 86\% and specificity was 94\%, and the NLC had a sensitivity of 43\% and a specificity of 96\%. Conclusions: Although CCR and NLC criteria may reduce the need for C-spine imaging in children 10 years and younger; they are not sensitive or specific enough to be used as currently designed. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Background. The timing of initiation of Norepinephrine (NEP) in septic shock is controversial. Aim of the study. We evaluated the impact of early NEP simultaneously with fluids in those patients. Methods. We randomized 101 patients admitted to the emergency department with septic shock to early NEP simultaneously with IV fluids (early group) or after failed fluids trial (late group). The primary outcome was the in-hospital survival while the secondary outcomes were the time to target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg, lactate clearance and resuscitation volumes. Results. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the baseline characteristics. NEP infusion started after 25 (20e30) and 120 (120e180) min in the early and late groups ( p 5 0.000). MAP of 65 mmHg was achieved faster in the early group (2 [1e3.5] h vs. 3 [2e4.75] h, p 5 0.003). Serum lactate was decreased by 37.8 (24e49\%) and 22.2 (3.3e38\%) in both groups respectively ( p 5 0.005). Patients with early NEP were resuscitated by significantly lower volume of fluids (25 [18.8e28.7] mL/kg vs. 32.5 [24.4e34.6] mL/kg) in the early and late groups ( p 5 0.000). The early group had survival rate of 71.9\% compared to 45.5\% in the late group ( p 5 0.007). NEP started after 30 (20e120 min) in survivors vs. 120 (30e165 min) in non-survivors ( p 5 0.013). Conclusions. We concluded that early Norepinephrine in septic shock might cause earlier restoration of blood pressure, better lactate clearance and improve in-hospital survival. {\'O} 2019 IMSS.

Our study includes 19 episodes of swallowed razor blades. In 2 cases, these events were secondary to suicide attempts. In the other cases, it was an expression of discontent and rejection of the situation in the prison. Three patients had a psychiatric history. The mean age of the patients is 24 years. The initial clinical examination had not objectified signs of gastrointestinal perforation. Thoraco-abdomino-pelvic computed tomography scans allowed specifying the blade location in all cases. It also objectified a pneumo-mediastinum in 2 cases. The blade location was esophageal in 1 case, gastric in 6 cases, and in the small bowel in the other cases. The first 4 patients had surgical removal of the blade. In subsequent cases, surgical abstention was the rule, and spontaneous blade expulsion was observed. The average time of expulsion was 4 days. In our experience, surgical removal of sharp foreign bodies should not be performed systematically without complications.},

These small but powerful  sources of energy are ubiquitous in every household and when swallowed,  especially in small children, have been shown to create significant injury in a  short amount of time leading to long-term morbidity and possible death. This  review highlights the latest findings regarding epidemiology, pathophysiology,  diagnosis and management of ingested button batteries. RECENT FINDINGS: Updated  epidemiology from the National Capital Poison Center, new bench research looking  at injury patterns and possible mitigation strategies, updated ideas on  management algorithms including the use of a trauma protocol, close-look second  endoscopy and management of button batteries in the lower gastrointestinal tract  are reviewed in this paper. SUMMARY: Despite advances in the understanding of  injury mechanics and innovations leading to early diagnosis and improved  management of button battery ingestion, parental and provider education remain  the most important tools to keep children well tolerated from the sequelae of  these potentially fatal events. Collaboration between healthcare experts, public  health and industry is essential to find a safe answer to this ongoing threat.},

Clinical cases and  experience with body packers has increased since the first report appeared in  1971. These cases remain an uncommon cause of acute drug toxicity and/or bowel  obstruction. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 23 year-old man was brought to the emergency  department with seizures. CT imaging revealed numerous intestinal foreign bodies,  suspicious for body packing. The patient was stabilized and taken emergently to  the operating room for exploratory laparotomy and removal of 34 cocaine packets.  Ongoing treatment for cocaine overdose was also utilized. The patient recovered  without complications. DISCUSSION: This case provides insight and awareness for  proper diagnosis and management of body packers by physicians and surgeons alike.  CONCLUSION: We present a case report of acute cocaine intoxication in a young man  who ingested 34 packets of cocaine for means of drug trafficking. Medical  approaches are available for cases in which patients remain asymptomatic, but  surgical intervention is necessary for those with signs and symptoms of bowel  obstruction or drug overdose.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: We determine whether the Clinical Frailty Scale applied at emergency department (ED) triage is associated with important service- and patient-related outcomes. METHODS: We undertook a single-center, retrospective cohort study examining hospital-related outcomes and their associations with frailty scores assessed at ED triage. Participants were aged 65 years or older, registered on their first ED presentation during the study period at a single, centralized ED in the United Kingdom. Baseline data included age, sex, Clinical Frailty Scale score, National Early Warning Score-2 and the Charlson Comorbidity Index score; outcomes included length of stay, readmissions (any future admissions), and mortality (inhospital or out of hospital) up to 2 years after ED presentation. Survival analysis methods (standard and competing risks) were applied to assess associations between ED triage frailty scores and outcomes. Unadjusted incidence curves and adjusted hazard ratios are presented. RESULTS: A total of 52,562 individuals representing 138,328 ED attendances were included; participants' mean age was 78.0 years, and 55\% were women. Initial admission rates generally increased with frailty. Mean length of stay after 30- or 180-day follow-up was relatively low; all Clinical Frailty Scale categories included patients who experienced zero days' length of stay (ie, ambulatory care) and patients with relatively high numbers of inhospital days. Overall, 46\% of study participants were readmitted by the 2-year follow-up. Readmissions increased with Clinical Frailty Scale score up until a score of 6 and then attenuated. Mortality rates increased with increasing frailty; the adjusted hazard ratio was 3.6 for Clinical Frailty Scale score 7 to 8 compared with score 1 to~3. CONCLUSION: Frailty assessed at ED triage (with the Clinical Frailty Scale) is associated with adverse outcomes in older people. Its use in ED triage might aid immediate clinical decisionmaking and service configuration.},

  abstract = {Background/purpose Foreign body (FB) ingestion in children is very common. Children can ingest a wide variety of FBs. Most of the ingested FBs pass spontaneously through the gastrointestinal tract. Other FBs, especially uncommonly ingested objects, can present with complications and need intervention to be extracted. The aim of this study was to highlight the importance of timely intervention to extract these FBs. Patients and methods Between November 2012 and October 2017, patients who presented to our department with variously ingested FBs were retrospectively reviewed to detect those who needed intervention (surgical or endoscopic) to extract these FBs. Results During the specified time period, 480 patients with FB ingestion presented to our department. Out of these children, 12 patients ingested uncommon FBs or presented with symptoms of complications of impaction and needed intervention to extract these FBs. Three patients ingested multiple magnets. Three patients ingested pins which were impacted in and penetrated the duodenum. One patient ingested a screw which was impacted in the appendix. One patient ingested a sticky rubber toy which was impacted in the pylorus. One patient ingested hair (bezoar), which was also impacted in the pylorus. One patient ingested a disk battery which was impacted in and penetrated the esophagus, and all were surgically extracted. One patient had a slipped stent of repaired choanal atresia which was impacted in the gastroesophageal junction and one patient with repaired tracheoesophageal fistula ingested a stone which was impacted at the site of esophageal anastomosis, and both were endoscopically retrieved. Conclusion Children who ingested uncommon FBs or presented late with symptoms of complications of impaction needed intervention (surgically or endoscopically) to extract these FBs.

Here, we review the licensed sale of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals as exotic pets in the UK, identifying current geographical hotspots of trader activity, data gaps, and compliance issues related to this trade. In terms of trade volume, records showed large numbers of individual wild animals, across a wide range of species groups, are being legally sold in the UK. Maximum numbers of exotic pets permitted for sale included 54,634 amphibians, 64,810 reptiles, 23,507 birds, and 6,479 mammals. Moreover, nearly 2000 pet traders located in 283 different local authority areas had permission to sell exotic pets. The scope and scale of the trade draws additional attention to the substantial animal welfare challenges associated with it, and our review serves to highlight several shortcomings associated with the licensed exotic pet trade in the UK. Pet shop licences often lacked detailed information about the specific type and number of animals permitted for sale, which raises compliance concerns and hinders efforts to carry out adequate inspection and monitoring. Ninety-five pet traders in England had been given a one star rating, indicating `minor failings' in animal welfare, and some local authorities in England were still operating under the old Pet Animals Act (1951). We recommend that resources should be prioritised and focused towards local authorities in England that are not operating under the new Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations (2018), and that local authorities should improve data reporting on all licenses issued to aid inspection and monitoring.},

This approach involves adjustments of cardiac preload, afterload, and contractility to balance oxygen delivery with oxygen demand. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of early goal-directed therapy before admission to the intensive care unit. Methods We randomly assigned patients who arrived at an urban emergency department with severe sepsis or septic shock to receive either six hours of early goal-directed therapy or standard therapy (as a control) before admission to the intensive care unit. Clinicians who subsequently assumed the care of the patients were blinded to the treatment assignment. In-hospital mortality (the primary efficacy outcome), end points with respect to resuscitation, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores were obtained serially for 72 hours and compared between the study groups. Results Of the 263 enrolled patients, 130 were randomly assigned to early goal-directed therapy and 133 to standard therapy; there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to base-line characteristics. In-hospital mortality was 30.5 percent in the group assigned to early goal-directed therapy, as compared with 46.5 percent in the group assigned to standard therapy (P=0.009). During the interval from 7 to 72 hours, the patients assigned to early goaldirected therapy had a significantly higher mean ({\textpm}SD) central venous oxygen saturation (70.4{\textpm}10.7 percent vs. 65.3{\textpm}11.4 percent), a lower lactate concentration (3.0{\textpm}4.4 vs. 3.9{\textpm}4.4 mmol per liter), a lower base deficit (2.0{\textpm}6.6 vs. 5.1{\textpm}6.7 mmol per liter), and a higher pH (7.40{\textpm}0.12 vs. 7.36{\textpm}0.12) than the patients assigned to standard therapy (P<<0.02 for all comparisons). During the same period, mean APACHE II scores were significantly lower, indicating less severe organ dysfunction, in the patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy than in those assigned to standard therapy (13.0{\textpm}6.3 vs. 15.9{\textpm}6.4, P{$<$}0.001).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Foreign bodies (FBs) in the upper gastrointestinal tract are produced chiefly by accidental swallowing but rarely produce symptoms. Removal of FBs is not an infrequent challenge for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The aim of this study is to elicit our experience in a 5-year period in dealing with FBs in the upper gastrointestinal tract using upper endoscopy. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at Zagazig University Hospitals, Egypt, over a 5-year period. We reviewed all patients' files with full notations on age, sex, type of FB and its anatomical location, treatments, and outcomes (complications, success rates, and mortalities). Patients with incomplete files and those with FBs not identified at the endoscopic examination were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients were identified. Their ages ranged from 6 months to 102 years. Slight male predominance was noticed (53.3\%). The most frequent presentation was a history of FB ingestion without any associated manifestations (44.4\%). Coins were the most commonly encountered FBs (14/45). Esophagus was the most common site of trapping (27/45). The overall success rate was 95.6\% (43/45). Upper endoscopy successfully resolved the problem by either FB removal (41/43) or dislodgment of the impacted fleshy meat to the stomach (2/43). Two cases were referred for surgical removal. The rate of complications was 6.7\%. Furthermore, no mortalities due to FB ingestion or removal had been reported throughout the study. CONCLUSION: Our experience with FB removal emphasizes its importance and ease when performed by experienced hands, at well-equipped endoscopy units, and under conscious sedation in most cases, with high success rates and minor complications.},

  abstract = {Introduction. High-dose insulin therapy, along with glucose supplementation, has emerged as an effective treatment for severe beta-blocker and calcium channel-blocker poisoning. We review the experimental data and clinical experience that suggests high-dose insulin is superior to conventional therapies for these poisonings. Presentation and general management. Hypotension, bradycardia, decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and cardiogenic shock are characteristic features of beta-blocker and calcium-channel blocker poisoning. Initial treatment is primarily supportive and includes saline fluid resuscitation which is essential to correct vasodilation and low cardiac filling pressures. Conventional therapies such as atropine, glucagon and calcium often fail to improve hemodynamic status in severely poisoned patients. Catecholamines can increase blood pressure and heart rate, but they also increase SVR which may result in decreases in cardiac output and perfusion of vascular beds. The increased myocardial oxygen demand that results from catecholamines and vasopressors may be deleterious in the setting of hypotension and decreased coronary perfusion. Methods. The Medline, Embase, Toxnet, and Google Scholar databases were searched for the years 1975-2010 using the terms: high-dose insulin, hyperinsulinemia-euglycemia, beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker, toxicology, poisoning, antidote, toxin-induced cardiovascular shock, and overdose. In addition, a manual search of the Abstracts of the North American Congress of Clinical Toxicology and the Congress of the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists published in Clinical Toxicology for the years 1996-2010 was undertaken. These searches identified 485 articles of which 72 were considered relevant. Mechanisms of high-dose insulin benefit. There are three main mechanisms of benefit: increased inotropy, increased intracellular glucose transport, and vascular dilatation. Efficacy of high-dose insulin. Animal models have shown high-dose insulin to be superior to calcium salts, glucagon, epinephrine, and vasopressin in terms of survival. Currently, there are no published controlled clinical trials in humans, but a review of case reports and case series supports the use of high-dose insulin as an initial therapy. High-dose insulin treatment protocols. When first introduced, insulin doses were cautiously initiated at 0.5 U/kg bolus followed by a 0.5-1 U/kg/h continuous infusion due to concern for hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalances. With increasing clinical experience and the publication of animal studies, high-dose insulin dosing recommendations have been increased to 1 U/kg insulin bolus followed by a 1-10 U/kg/h continuous infusion. Although the optimal regimen is still to be determined, bolus doses up to 10 U/kg and continuous infusions as high as 22 U/kg/h have been administered with good outcomes and minimal adverse events. Adverse effects of high-dose insulin. The major anticipated adverse events associated with high-dose insulin are hypoglycemia and hypokalemia. Glucose concentrations must be monitored regularly and supplementation of glucose will likely be required throughout therapy and for up to 24 h after discontinuation of high-dose insulin. The change in serum potassium concentrations reflects a shifting of potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space rather than a decrease in total body stores. Conclusions. While more clinical data are needed, animal studies and human case reports demonstrate that high-dose insulin (1-10 U/kg/hour) is a superior treatment in terms of safety and survival in both beta-blocker and calcium-channel blocker poisoning. High-dose insulin should be considered initial therapy in these poisonings. {\copyright} 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to characterize the cardiovascular responses to dobutamine and their predictors. Our hypotheses were that dobutamine mainly produces tachycardia and vasodilation and fails to improve the microcirculation of patients with septic shock. Materials and Methods: Systemic hemodynamics and sublingual microcirculation were evaluated with dobutamine (0, 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 {$\mu$}g kg- 1 min- 1) in 23 patients with septic shock. Results: Dobutamine increased heart rate, cardiac index, and stroke volume index (SVI). Mean blood pressure was unchanged, and systemic vascular resistance decreased. Individual responses were heterogeneous. Stroke volume index increased in 52\% of the patients. These patients showed lower changes in mean blood pressure (3 {\textpm} 16 mm Hg vs - 10 {\textpm} 6 mm Hg, P b .05) and higher increases in cardiac index (1.47 {\textpm} 0.93 L m- 1 m- 2 vs 0.20 {\textpm} 0.5 L m- 1 m- 2) than did nonresponders. Changes in SVI significantly correlated with echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.55). In the whole group, perfused capillary density remained unchanged (14.0 {\textpm} 4.3 mm/mm2 vs 14.8 {\textpm} 3.7 mm/mm2), but improved if basal values were 12 mm/mm2 or less (9.1 {\textpm} 4.3 mm/mm2 vs 12.5 {\textpm} 4.8 mm/mm2). Conclusions: Dobutamine produced variable hemodynamic effects. Systolic dysfunction was the only variable associated with increases in SVI. Finally, dobutamine only improved sublingual microcirculation when severe alterations were found at baseline.},

METHODS: Patients older than 16 years of age who presented to the ED between January 1(st) and December 31(st) of 2010 with complaints related to swallowed foreign bodies were identified from electronic health records and patient charts. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients presented with a complaint of foreign body ingestion during the study period. Overall, an X-ray was performed on 75 patients, and a fiberoptic evaluation was performed on 45 patients. A foreign body was detected in 46 (46\%) patients. The diagnostic yield of the X-ray was 27 (36\%) out of 75 patients, while the diagnostic yield of the fiberoptic evaluations was 21 (47\%) out of 45 patients. The detected foreign bodies were mostly located in the esophagus (17 out of 46 foreign bodies detected). When the types of ingested foreign bodies were evaluated, 52 (52\%) patients reported ingesting food, and 19 (19\%) patients reported swallowing pins. An X-ray was performed on 33 patients with accidental food ingestions but yielded a positive result in only two cases. In 12 out of 21 patients with accidental food ingestion who underwent fiberoptic evaluation, the foreign material was detected and removed. CONCLUSION: Plain radiography is helpful in the localization of radiopaque swollen foreign bodies, while fiberoptic methods are useful as both diagnostic and therapeutic tools, regardless of radiopacity.},

In this study, reasons for bezoar formation, measures to be taken and treatment modalities were investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The files of the patients who were found to have gastro-intestinal bezoars and who were treated at Istanbul University, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty General Surgery Department and Emergency Unit between the years 1970 and 2005 were analysed. RESULTS: Thirteen (30\%) of the 44 patients in the study were women, 31 (70\%) were men: the mean age was 55.5 +/- 19.6 (range 22-96) years. Enzymatic dissolution (3 patients) and endoscopic fragmentation (four patients) were unsuccessful. Laparoscopic gastrotomy (n = 2), gastrotomy (n = 16), gastric resection (n = 3), enterotomy (n = 12), segmental intestinal resection (n = 3), gastroduodenotomy (n = 1), and gastrotomy + enterotomy (n = 3) were performed. In two patients, bezoars were fragmented and milked to caecum. There were no major postoperative complications, except abdominal wound infection in 4 patients and one patient who had a recurrent intestinal bezoar five years after the operation. One of the patients died because of heart failure on the 7th postoperative day. Mean hospital stay was 9.5 +/- 3.6 days. CONCLUSION: Even though rarely seen in digestive tract diseases, the probability of BZ formation should always be remembered. After the removal of BZs by conservative methods or surgery, precautions should be taken against recurrence and possible underlying psychiatric disorders should be treated.},

Patients and Method: Retrospective study in patients under 14 years of age who underwent EGD at the Hospital San Vicente Fundacion de Medellin, between January 2019 and June 2020. The following sociodemographic characteristics were evaluated: age, sex, type of health insurance, place of origin, service where the procedure was indicated, indications for en-doscopy, type of care, purpose of the procedure, endoscopic findings, endoscopic intervention, complications associated with the procedure or anesthesia, and relevance of the procedure. Results: 466 patients who underwent 552 endoscopies were included. Fifty-seven percent of the patients were male. In diagnostic EGD, the main indications were abdominal pain (23\%) and upper gas-trointestinal bleeding (17\%). In therapeutic EGD, the most frequently performed procedures were percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (41\%), foreign body removal (27\%), and esophageal dila-tion (24\%). The complication rate related to the procedure was 0.5\% and in relation to anesthesia was 0.7\%. Conclusions: EGD in pediatric patients is an effective and safe tool if performed with an appropriate indication. One-third of therapeutic EGD could be avoided from primary prevention.},

Incidents often involve ingestion of small metal objects (e.g., paperclips, razor blades) or other commonly available items like pens or eating utensils. Despite ingestion of relatively sharp objects, most episodes can be clinically managed with either observation or endoscopy. Surgery should be reserved for those with signs or symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or obstruction. For those with a history of IIFO, efforts should focus on prevention of recurrence as subsequent episodes are associated with higher morbidity, significant healthcare and security costs. The pattern of IIFO is often repetitive, with escalation both in frequency of ingestions and in number of items ingested. Little is known about successful prevention strategies, but efforts to monitor patients and provide psychiatric care are potential best-practice strategies.

  abstract = {Background{\enspace} Ingestion of foreign bodies may be seen unconsciously or intentionally in patients with mental health problems. Most cases pass through the esophagus slowly; however, in some cases, the tumor may be located in narrower areas of the digestive tract that require endoscopic or surgical intervention. This study describes a rare case of successful removal of more than 450 pieces of metal objects from the stomach of a 36-year-old man via ingestion of foreign bodies at Imam Khomeini Hospital in Ahvaz. Case presentation{\enspace} A 36-year-old male patient (Aryan race) presented with complaints of chronic abdominal pain, frequent vomiting, and intolerance to liquids and food. The patient's companions mentioned a history of gradual ingestion of small metal objects 3 months prior. The patient was conscious and had stable vital signs. In the patient's X-ray and endoscopy, multiple metal objects inside the patient's stomach were observed, causing gastric outlet obstruction. The patient underwent gastrostomy surgery, and 452 screws, nuts, keys, stones, and other metal parts weighing 2900 g were removed from the stomach. Five days after the operation, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric service in good general condition and was diagnosed with psychosis, and her condition returned to normal at follow-up. Conclusion{\enspace} Successful removal of this foreign body is rare. In chronic abdominal pain, especially in the context of psychiatric disorders, attention should be given to the ingestion of foreign bodies. In swallowing large amounts of sharp and metallic foreign objects, surgical intervention is necessary, especially in cases of obstruction, and saves the patient's life.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Intravesical foreign bodies (FBs) are rare and have interesting pathology for urologists. There has been an increase in reports of intravesical  FBs in the last few decades, but they are still considered to be rare in  children, especially young girls. Here we present our experience in the  assessment and management of intravesical self-inserted sharp objects in  children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of children with  self-introduced intravesical FBs admitted to our hospital during the last 10  years. Twenty-four cases were included in this study (20 girls and 4 boys). The  presenting symptoms and methods of diagnosis and treatment were reviewed.  RESULTS: The ages of the patients ranged from 4 to 12 years. In all cases,  foreign bodies were self-inserted. All patients were subjected to KUB (kidney,  ureter, bladder radiograph) and abdominal ultrasonography. Based on the KUB  findings, the FBs in girls were found to be metal pins in 12, a hair clip in  four, and a wooden pencil in three (Figure). In boys, a coiled electric wire was  found in three, with a urinary calculus formed over one of them. There were small  metallic objects in two cases (1 boy and 1 girl). Endoscopic removal of FBs was  done successfully in 19 cases (18 girls and 1 boy), and open cystostomy was  performed in four cases (3 boys and 1 girl). DISCUSSION: Intravesical FBs are  important considerations in the differential diagnosis of pathological lower  urinary tract symptoms. They represent significant challenges to urologists.  Among children, the reasons for self-insertion of FBs might reflect psychiatric  disorders. Routine psychiatric evaluations should be offered to all patients with  intentional FB insertion to avoid missing any underlying psychiatric disorders.  In our study, psychiatric evaluations have been advised for all the affected  children and their parents. Self-inserted FBs are commonly seen in adults and are  rarely encountered in children. To our knowledge, this is the largest reported  series of children with self-inflicted intravesical FBs. In addition, all of the  FBs in this study had one or more sharp edges that made their endoscopic  extraction more difficult without causing bladder or urethral damage. In  children, removal of intravesical FBs represents a great challenge, as the size  of the pediatric urethra may hinder safe transurethral removal. Endoscopic  handling of intravesical FBs is mostly unsuccessful in boys because of the long  and narrow urethra, and open cystostomy might be the treatment of choice to save  the urethra. In contrast, the short female urethra renders the endoscopic removal  of intravesical FBs more successful. In this study, endoscopic removal of FBs was  done successfully in 19 cases (18 girls and 1 boy), and open cystostomy was  performed in four cases (3 boys and 1 girl). CONCLUSIONS: Although FBs in the  urinary tract of children are very rare, they need to be considered during any  evaluation of pathological lower urinary tract symptoms. Endoscopic management is  feasible for most of these patients. The size, number, nature of foreign bodies,  and any associated urinary calculi determine the treatment modality.},

A 6-year-old boy was referred to our institution with a 12 h history of abdominal pain. This pain was diffuse and crampy in nature and associated with multiple episodes of non-bilious, non-bloody emesis. On evaluation he was stable and his abdomen demonstrated slight distention and tenderness without peritoneal signs. Plain abdominal radiographs demonstrated some distended loops of small bowel and a radio-opaque foreign object within the mid-abdomen. A small bowel obstruction secondary to foreign body ingestion was diagnosed and an emergent laparotomy performed. Upon exploration, a transition zone was noted near the ileocecal valve. Further exploration revealed the obstruction to be caused secondary to the apposition of two small (8 mm) magnets, one in the proximal ileum and the other near the ileocecal valve, resulting in an internal hernia. The magnets were easily separated relieving the obstruction and both were removed via two small bowel enterotomies. After being presented with the magnets, his parents suspected that they came from the clothes of a Polly Pocket (Mattel, Inc., El Segundo, CA) doll. The patient had an uneventful post-operative course and was discharged to home on the second post-operative day. This case demonstrates the complications that may occur with multiple magnet ingestion. It highlights the need for close observation and early surgical intervention in children with a suspected history of foreign body ingestion, a clinical picture of gastrointestinal distress, and radiographic evidence of a radio-opaque foreign object.},

Methods: During the study period, patients arriving to the PEDwere classified by trained nurses with the Pediatric Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale using a computer system, from which data were obtained and analyzed retrospectively. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of children hospitalized related with PAT findings. The secondary outcome measures were the admission to the intensive care unit (\%), PED length of stay, and performance of blood tests (\%). Results: Among the 302,103 episodes included, there were abnormal PAT findings in 24,120 cases (7.9\%). Multivariate analysis adjusted for age confirmed that PAT findings and triage levelwere independent risk factors for admission (odds ratio [OR], 2.21; 95\%confidence interval [CI], 2.13-2.29;OR, 6.01;95\%CI, 5.79-6.24, respectively).Abnormalfindings inappearanceor in more than 1 PAT componentwere evenmore strongly associated with admission (3.99; 95\% CI, 3.63-4.38; 14.99, 95\% CI, 11.99-18.74, respectively). When adjusted for triage level and age, abnormal PAT findings were also an independent risk factor for intensive care unit admission (OR, 4.44; 95\% CI, 3.77-5.24) and a longer stay in the PED (OR, 1.78; 95\%CI, 1.72-1.84). Conclusions: Abnormal findings in the PATapplied by trained nurses at triage identify patientswith a higher risk of hospitalization. The PAT seems to be a valid tool for identifying themost severe patients as a first step in the triage process.},

  abstract = {Background: Pre-hospital endotracheal intubation is frequently used for trauma patients in many emergency medical systems. Despite a wide range of publications in the field, it is debated whether the intervention is associated with a favourable outcome, when compared to more conservative airway measures. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify interventional and observational studies where the mortality rates of adult trauma patients undergoing pre-hospital endotracheal intubation were compared to those undergoing emergency department intubation. Results: Twenty-one studies examining 35,838 patients were included. The median mortality rate in patients undergoing pre-hospital intubation was 48\% (range 8--94\%), compared to 29\% (range 6--67\%) in patients undergoing intubation in the emergency department. Odds ratios were in favour of emergency department intubation both in crude and adjusted mortality, with 2.56 (95\% CI: 2.06, 3.18) and 2.59 (95\% CI: 1.97, 3.39), respectively. The overall quality of evidence is very low. Twelve of the twenty-one studies found a significantly higher mortality rate after pre-hospital intubation, seven found no significant differences, one found a positive effect, and for one study an analysis of the mortality rate was beyond the scope of the article. Conclusions: The rationale for wide and unspecific indications for pre-hospital intubation seems to lack support in the literature, despite several publications involving a relatively large number of patients. Pre-hospital intubation is a complex intervention where guidelines and research findings should be approached cautiously. The association between pre-hospital intubation and a higher mortality rate does not necessarily contradict the importance of the intervention, but it does call for a thorough investigation by clinicians and researchers into possible causes for this finding.},

  abstract = {Background: International guidelines recommend administration of 1 mg of intravenous epinephrine every 3--5 min during cardiac arrest. The optimal dose of epinephrine is not known. We evaluated the association of reduced frequency and dose of epinephrine with survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Methods: Included were patients with non-traumatic OHCA treated by advanced life support (ALS) providers from January 1, 2008 to June 30, 2016. During the before period, providers were instructed to give epinephrine 1 mg intravenously at 4 min followed by additional 1 mg doses every eight minutes to patients with OHCA with a shockable rhythm and 1 mg doses every two minutes to patients with a non-shockable rhythm (higher dose). On October 1, 2012, providers were instructed to reduce the dose of epinephrine treatment during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA): 0.5 mg at 4 and 8 min followed by additional doses of 0.5 mg every 8 min for shockable rhythms and 0.5 mg every 2 min for non-shockable rhythms (lower dose). Patients with shockable initial rhythms were analyzed separately from those with non-shockable initial rhythms. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge with a secondary outcome of favorable neurological status (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] 1 or 2) at hospital discharge. Multiple logistic regression modeling was used to adjust for age, sex, presence of a witness, bystander CPR, and response interval. Results: 2255 patients with OHCA were eligible for analysis. Of these, 24.6\% had an initially shockable rhythm. Total epinephrine dose per patient decreased from a mean {\textpm} standard deviation of 3.4 {\textpm} 2.3 mg--2.6 {\textpm} 1.9 mg (p {$<$} 0.001) in the shockable group and 3.5 {\textpm} 1.9 mg--2.8 {\textpm} 1.7 mg (p {$<$} 0.001) in the non-shockable group. Among those with a shockable rhythm, survival to hospital discharge was 35.0\% in the higher dose group vs. 34.2\% in the lower dose group. Among those with a non-shockable rhythm, survival was 4.2\% in the higher dose group vs. 5.1\% in the lower dose group. Lower dose vs. higher dose was not significantly associated with survival: adjusted odds ratio, aOR 0.91 (95\% CI 0.62--1.32, p = 0.61) if shockable and aOR 1.26 (95\% CI 0.79--2.01, p = 0.33) if non-shockable. Lower dose vs. higher dose was not significantly associated with favorable neurological status at discharge: aOR 0.84 (95\% CI 0.57--1.24, p = 0.377) if shockable and aOR 1.17 (95\% CI 0.68--2.02, p = 0.577) if non-shockable. Conclusion: Reducing the dose of epinephrine administered during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was not associated with a change in survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurological outcomes after OHCA. {\copyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Polyurethane adhesives are found in a large number of household products in the United States and are used for a variety of purposes. Several brands of these  expanding wood glues (those containing diphenylmethane diisocyanate [MDI]) have  the potential to form gastrointestinal (GI) foreign bodies if ingested. The  ingested adhesive forms an expanding ball of glue in the esophagus and gastric  lumen. This expansion is caused by a polymerization reaction using the heat,  water, and gastric acids of the stomach. A firm mass is created that can be 4-8  times its original volume. As little as 2 oz of glue have been reported to  develop gastric foreign bodies. The obstructive mass is reported to form within  minutes of ingestion of the adhesive. The foreign body can lead to esophageal  impaction and obstruction, airway obstruction, gastric outflow obstruction,  mucosal hemorrhage, ulceration, laceration, perforation of the esophageal and  gastric linings, and death. Clinical signs following ingestion include anorexia,  lethargy, vomiting, tachypnea, and abdominal distention and pain, and typically  develop within 12 hours. Clinical signs may depend upon the size of the mass. If  left untreated, perforation and rupture of the esophagus or stomach can occur.  The glue mass does not stick to the GI mucosa and is not always detectable on  abdominal palpation. Radiographs are recommended to confirm the presence of the  "glue-ball" foreign body, and radiographic evidence of the obstruction may be  seen as early as 4-6 hours following ingestion. Emesis is contraindicated owing  to the risk of aspiration of the glue into the respiratory tree or the subsequent  lodging of the expanding glue mass in the esophagus. Likewise, efforts to dilute  the glue and prevent the formation of the foreign body through administration of  liquids, activated charcoal, or bulk-forming products to push the foreign body  through the GI tract have proven ineffective. Even endoscopy performed to remove  the foreign body has been shown to be unreliable. The safest, most effective, and  successful therapy is surgical intervention to remove the GI foreign body. If  performed early enough, complete recovery of the animal can be expected.  Differential diagnoses for polyurethane adhesive ingestion include any potential  cause of GI obstruction. The public is largely unaware of the hazards that  ingestion of this product may produce. Public education efforts are needed to  inform pet owners about the hazards of these glues and the overall importance of  providing our companion animals with safe, poison-free environments.},

A snare and magnetic catheter are used as endoscopic tools to extract various metallic items. Results: The bridle technique was used in 68 endoscopies in 3 patients who presented numerous times for foreign body ingestions. The technique was successful in 66 of the 68 procedures, with no adverse events.

METHOD: Five primary caregivers of children  with a history of dysphagia and/or feeding difficulties post-ingestion injury (4  chemical, 1 button battery) completed the Children's Picky Eating Questionnaire  (CPEQ), and participated in a semi-structured interview. Interviews explored  experiences of caring for a child with dysphagia and/or feeding difficulties,  impressions of services and supports, and additional impacts to the child and  family. Content analysis was used to identify key themes. RESULT: Primary  caregiver report and CPEQ results confirmed all children had some degree of  persisting dysphagia and/or feeding difficulties at time of interview (mean 4.13  years' post-injury). Interviews identified five key themes: 1) The initial trauma  of the injury, 2) The experience of associated and ongoing medical issues, 3)  Managing altered oral intake, 4) Experiences of services and support, and 5)  Impacts on the child, primary caregiver, and wider family unit. All caregivers  reported significant challenges and concerns, and potential areas of service  improvement were highlighted. CONCLUSION: The current data highlights specific  issues experienced by primary caregivers, and poses areas for improving primary  caregiver and family supports. Family-centered models of care are needed to  support the whole family unit in caring for a child with dysphagia and/or feeding  difficulties post-ingestion injury.},

  abstract = {Background Neutropenic sepsis remains a common treatment complication for patients receiving systemic anti-cancer treatment. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence have not recommended switching from empirical intravenous antibiotics to oral antibiotics within 48\,h for patients assessed as low risk for septic complications because of uncertainty about whether this would achieve comparable outcomes to using intravenous antibiotics for longer. The UK National Institute for Health Research funded the EASI-SWITCH trial to tackle this uncertainty. Methods The trial is a pragmatic, randomised, non-inferiority trial that aims to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of early switching from intravenous to oral antibiotics in cancer patients with low-risk neutropenic sepsis. Patients {$\geq$} 16\,years, receiving systemic anti-cancer treatment (acute leukaemics/stem cell transplants excluded), with a temperature of {$>$}\,38\,{$^\circ$}C, neutrophil count {$\leq$} 1.0\,{\texttimes}\,109/L, MASCC (Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer) score\,{$\geq$}\,21 and receiving IV piperacillin/tazobactam or meropenem for less than 24\,h are eligible to participate. Patients are randomised 1:1 either (i) to switch to oral ciprofloxacin and co-amoxiclav within 12--24\,h of commencing intravenous antibiotics, completing at least 5\,days total antibiotics (intervention), or (ii) to continue intravenous antibiotics for at least 48\,h, with ongoing antibiotics being continued at the physician's discretion (control). Patients are discharged home when their physician deems it appropriate. The primary outcome measure is a composite of treatment failures as assessed at day 14. The criteria for treatment failure include fever persistence or recurrence 72\,h after starting intravenous antibiotics, escalation from protocolised antibiotics, hospital readmission related to infection/antibiotics, critical care support or death. Based on a 15\% treatment failure rate in the control group and a 15\% non-inferiority margin, the recruitment target is 230 patients. Discussion If the trial demonstrates non-inferiority of early switching to oral antibiotics, with potential benefits for patient quality of life and resource savings, this finding will have significant implications for the routine clinical management of those with low-risk neutropenic sepsis.

  abstract = {Background: Early rapid fluid resuscitation (boluses) in African children with severe febrile illnesses increases the 48-hour mortality by 3.3\% compared with controls (no bolus). We explored the effect of boluses on 48-hour allcause mortality by clinical presentation at enrolment, hemodynamic changes over the first hour, and on different modes of death, according to terminal clinical events. We hypothesize that boluses may cause excess deaths from neurological or respiratory events relating to fluid overload. Methods: Pre-defined presentation syndromes (PS; severe acidosis or severe shock, respiratory, neurological) and predominant terminal clinical events (cardiovascular collapse, respiratory, neurological) were described by randomized arm (bolus versus control) in 3,141 severely ill febrile children with shock enrolled in the Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (FEAST) trial. Landmark analyses were used to compare early mortality in treatment groups, conditional on changes in shock and hypoxia parameters. Competing risks methods were used to estimate cumulative incidence curves and sub-hazard ratios to compare treatment groups in terms of terminal clinical events. Results: Of 2,396 out of 3,141 (76\%) classifiable participants, 1,647 (69\%) had a severe metabolic acidosis or severe shock PS, 625 (26\%) had a respiratory PS and 976 (41\%) had a neurological PS, either alone or in combination. Mortality was greatest among children fulfilling criteria for all three PS (28\% bolus, 21\% control) and lowest for lone respiratory (2\% bolus, 5\% control) or neurological (3\% bolus, 0\% control) presentations. Excess mortality in bolus arms versus control was apparent for all three PS, including all their component features. By one hour, shock had resolved (responders) more frequently in bolus versus control groups (43\% versus 32\%, P {$<$}0.001), but excess mortality with boluses was evident in responders (relative risk 1.98, 95\% confidence interval 0.94 to 4.17, P = 0.06) and `nonresponders' (relative risk 1.67, 95\% confidence interval 1.23 to 2.28, P = 0.001), with no evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.68). The major difference between bolus and control arms was the higher proportion of cardiogenic or shock terminal clinical events in bolus arms (n = 123; 4.6\% versus 2.6\%, P = 0.008) rather than respiratory (n = 61; 2.2\% versus 1.3\%, P = 0.09) or neurological (n = 63, 2.1\% versus 1.8\%, P = 0.6) terminal clinical events.},

Methods: This non-inferiority, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was to compare the efficacy of placebo versus oral prednisolone in children aged 24--72 months presenting with virus-associated wheeze at the paediatric emergency department of Princess Margaret Hospital in Perth, WA, Australia. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated random number program to receive placebo or prednisolone (1 mg/kg per day) for 3 days. The primary outcome was total length of stay in hospital until ready for discharge. Following an analysis to test the hypothesis that placebo is non-inferior to prednisolone, a post-hoc superiority analysis was done to test the hypothesis that prednisolone was superior to placebo. A non-inferiority margin of 10\% was used to establish non-inferiority. Efficacy analyses were on a modified intention-to-treat basis, whereby patients were excluded from the final efficacy analysis if consent was withdrawn, two doses of study drug were vomited, or paperwork was lost. All participants were included in safety analyses. This study is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12612000394842. Findings: Between June 11, 2012, and June 10, 2015, we screened 3727 patients for eligibility. 624 eligible patients were randomly assigned to treatment, and 605 patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (300 patients from the placebo group, 305 patients from the prednisolone group). The median length of stay until ready for discharge was longer in the placebo group (540 min [IQR 124--971]) than in the prednisolone group (370 min [121--709]); placebo was inferior to prednisolone. In the post-hoc superiority analysis of 605 patients, the unadjusted ratio of geometric mean for length of stay was 0{$\cdot$}79 (95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}64--0{$\cdot$}97; p=0{$\cdot$}0227) for the prednisolone group relative to the placebo group. No serious adverse events were reported during the study or follow-up period. One child in the placebo group had a non-specific maculopapular rash, which resolved spontaneously. Two children (one from each group) were reported to be hyperactive during follow-up assessments. Interpretation: Oral prednisolone had a clear benefit over placebo at reducing the length of stay in children presenting to a paediatric emergency department with virus-associated wheeze and was well tolerated.

Although adrenaline may increase the chance of achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), there is limited evidence that repeated doses of adrenaline improves overall survival, and increasing evidence of a detrimental effect on neurological function in survivors. This paper reports the relationship between repeated doses of adrenaline and survival in a cohort of patients attended by the London Ambulance Service in the United Kingdom. Methods: A retrospective review of OHCA treated by the London Ambulance Service over a one year period. Patients aged !18 years who received one or more doses of adrenaline (1 mg bolus) during resuscitation were included in the analyses.

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic antigen-mediated eosinophilic inflammatory disease isolated to the esophagus. As a clinicopathologic disorder, a diagnosis of EoE requires a constellation of clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and histologic findings (at least 15 eosinophils/high-powered microscope field (eos/hpf)). Current guidelines no longer require the failure of response to proton pump inhibitor medications to establish a diagnosis of EoE, but continue to suggest the exclusion of other etiologies of esophageal eosinophilia. The treatment goals for EoE are improvement in clinical symptoms, resolution of esophageal eosinophilia and other histologic abnormalities, endoscopic improvement, improved quality of life, improved esophageal function, minimized adverse effects of treatment, and prevention of disease progression and subsequent complications. Currently, there is no cure for EoE, making long-term treatment necessary. Standard treatment modalities include dietary modifications, esophageal dilation, and pharmacologic therapy. Effective pharmacologic therapies include corticosteroids, rapidly emerging biological therapies, and proton pump inhibitor medications. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of medical interventions for people with eosinophilic esophagitis. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP to 3 March 2023. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any medical intervention or food elimination diet for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis, either alone or in combination, to any other intervention (including placebo). Data collection and analysis Pairs of review authors independently selected studies and conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We expressed outcomes as a risk ratio (RR) and as the mean or standardized mean difference (MD/SMD) with 95\% confidence interval (CI). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Our primary outcomes were: clinical, histological, and endoscopic improvement, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Secondary outcomes were: serious and total adverse events, and quality of life. Main results We included 41 RCTs with 3253 participants. Eleven studies included pediatric patients while the rest recruited both children and adults. Four studies were in patients with inactive disease while the rest were in patients with active disease. We identified 19 intervention comparisons. In this abstract we present the results of the primary outcomes for the two main comparisons: corticosteroids versus placebo and biologics versus placebo, based on the prespecified outcomes defined of the primary studies. Fourteen studies compared corticosteroids to placebo for induction of remission and the risk of bias for these studies was mostly low. Corticosteroids may lead to slightly better clinical improvement (20\% higher), measured dichotomously (risk ratio (RR) 1.74, 95\% CI 1.08 to 2.80; 6 studies, 583 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 4; low certainty), and may lead to slightly better clinical improvement, measured continuously (standard mean difference (SMD) 0.51, 95\% CI 0.17 to 0.85; 5 studies, 475 participants; low certainty). Corticosteroids lead to a large histological improvement (63\% higher), measured dichotomously (RR 11.94, 95\% CI 6.56 to 21.75; 12 studies, 978 participants; NNTB = 3; high certainty), and may lead to histological improvement, measured continuously (SMD 1.42, 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.82; 5 studies, 449 participants; low certainty). Corticosteroids may lead to little to no endoscopic improvement, measured dichotomously (RR 2.60, 95\% CI 0.82 to 8.19; 5 studies, 596 participants; low certainty), and may lead to endoscopic improvement, measured continuously (SMD 1.33, 95\% CI 0.59 to 2.08; 5 studies, 596 participants; low certainty). Corticosteroids may lead to slightly fewer withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.64, 95\% CI 0.43 to 0.96; 14 studies, 1032 participants; low certainty). Nine studies compared biologics to placebo for induction of remission. Biologics may result in little to no difference in clinical improvement, measured dichotomously (RR 1.14, 95\% CI 0.85 to 1.52; 5 studies, 410 participants; low certainty), and may result in better clinical improvement, measured continuously (SMD 0.50, 95\% CI 0.22 to 0.78; 7 studies, 387 participants; moderate certainty). Biologics result in better histological improvement (55\% higher), measured dichotomously (RR 6.73, 95\% CI 2.58 to 17.52; 8 studies, 925 participants; NNTB = 2; moderate certainty). We could not draw conclusions for this outcome when measured continuously (SMD 1.01, 95\% CI 0.36 to 1.66; 6 studies, 370 participants; very low certainty). Biologics may result in little to no difference in endoscopic improvement, measured dichotomously (effect not estimable, low certainty). We cannot draw conclusions for this outcome when measured continuously (SMD 2.79, 95\% CI 0.36 to 5.22; 1 study, 11 participants; very low certainty). There may be no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.55, 95\% CI 0.88 to 2.74; 8 studies, 792 participants; low certainty). Authors' conclusions Corticosteroids (as compared to placebo) may lead to clinical symptom improvement when reported both as dichotomous and continuous outcomes, from the primary study definitions. Corticosteroids lead to a large increase in histological improvement (dichotomous outcome) and may increase histological improvement (continuous outcome) when compared to placebo. Corticosteroids may or may not increase endoscopic improvement (depending on whether the outcome is measured dichotomously or continuously). Withdrawals due to adverse events (dichotomous outcome) may occur less frequently when corticosteroids are compared to placebo. Biologics (as compared to placebo) may not lead to clinical symptom improvement when reported as a dichotomous outcome and may lead to an increase in clinical symptom improvement (as a continuous outcome), from the primary study definitions. Biologics lead to a large increase in histological improvement when reported as a dichotomous outcome, but this is uncertain when reported as a continuous outcome, as compared to placebo. Biologics may not increase endoscopic improvement (dichotomous outcome), but this is uncertain when measured as a continuous outcome. Withdrawals due to adverse events as a dichotomous outcome may occur as frequently when biologics are compared to placebo. Plain language summary Medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis Key messages We found that while corticosteroids may improve patients' symptoms, they certainly reduce the amount of allergic cells (eosinophils) and they may improve what the disease looks like under visual inspection (endoscopy), when compared to placebo, for children and adults with eosinophilic esophagitis. They may be just as safe as a placebo (dummy treatment). We found that biologics (a type of treatment that uses substances made from living organisms to treat disease) may improve patients' symptoms, that they certainly reduce the amount of allergic cells, and that they may be no different in terms of what the disease looks like under visual inspection, when compared to placebo, for children and adults with eosinophilic esophagitis. They may be just as safe as a placebo. What is eosinophilic esophagitis? Eosinophilic esophagitis is a long-term allergic condition in which the esophagus becomes inflamed (sore), which can lead to difficulty swallowing, vomiting, heartburn, and chest and stomach pain. Particles in foods or the air cause the immune system to have an allergic reaction and produce immune cells, which are called eosinophils. These build up in the esophagus, the tube that connects the mouth with the stomach. Eosinophilic esophagitis was first identified in the 1990s and since then it has been recognized as a major digestive illness. It is not known what causes it, but it might be related to genetics combined with environmental triggers. People with eosinophilic esophagitis tend to have other allergies as well. Currently, there is no cure for eosinophilic esophagitis, making long-term treatment necessary. Standard treatments include diets, stretching of the esophagus (dilation), and drugs such as corticosteroids, biological medications, and proton pump inhibitor medications. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if the available medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis work for improving patients' symptoms, reducing the amount of allergic cells when measured under a microscope, and improving what the disease looks like under visual examination. We also wanted to find out how safe they are and if they improve quality of life. What did we do? We searched for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing any medical treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis with any other medical treatment, in both adults and children.  What did we find? We found 41 studies with 3253 participants. Eleven studies were in children only while the rest were in a mix of children and adults. We identified 19 comparisons. In this summary, we present the results of the two main comparisons: corticosteroids compared to placebo and biologics compared to placebo. We found that corticosteroids may be better than placebo at improving patients' symptoms. We are highly certain that corticosteroids are better than placebo at reducing the amount of eosinophils (allergic cells) when measured under a microscope. Corticosteroids may be better than placebo at improving what the disease looks like under visual examination (endoscopy). We also found that people taking corticosteroids may be less likely to leave a study due to unwanted or harmful effects (side effects), and that they probably experience a similar number of both serious side effects and side effects in total, compared to placebo. There may be no difference between corticosteroids and placebo in the improvement of quality of life. We found that biologics may be better than placebo at improving patients' symptoms. It is likely that biologics are better than placebo at reducing the amount of allergic cells when measured under a microscope. Biologics may be no different to placebo at improving what the disease looks like under visual examination. We also found that people on biologics may be equally likely to leave a study due to side effects, or have serious side effects, and may experience similar numbers of total side effects, compared to placebo. There may be no difference between biologics and placebo in the improvement of quality of life. What are the limitations of the evidence? The evidence in children only was quite limited and we do not know if the conclusions above can definitely apply to children specifically. Another limitation of the evidence is that the outcomes were measured in many different ways, which may have weakened our conclusions. Other treatments used by the participants were also something that varied a lot between people, and may have affected our conclusions. Finally, we were limited in the conclusions we could make about the effects of sex, age, extent of disease, dosage, and type of corticosteroid or biologic. How up-to-date is this review? This review is up-to-date to 3 March 2023.},

  abstract = {Background: Ultrasound lung comets (ULCs) consist of multiple comet tails originating from waterthickened interlobular septa. They are a new echographic tool to assess the pathologic increase in extravascular lung water, which is a possible harbinger of impending acute heart failure. The objective was to assess the prognostic value of ULCs in patients with dyspnea and/or chest pain syndrome at hospital admission. Methods and Results: A total of 290 consecutive in-hospital patients (aged 68 6 13 years) admitted for dyspnea and/or chest pain syndrome were evaluated on admission with a comprehensive two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic evaluation and chest sonography with ULC assessment. A patient ULC score was obtained by summing the number of comets from each of the scanning spaces in the anterior right and left hemithoraxes, from the second to fifth intercostal spaces. All patients were followed up for a median period of 16 months (interquartile range: 2.8e29.1 months). During the follow-up, 62 events occurred: 19 cardiac deaths, 3 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 20 acute heart failures requiring hospitalization, and 20 noncardiac deaths. The 16-month event-free survival was highest in patients with no ULCs and lowest in patients with severe (O30) ULCs at entry (70\% vs 19\%, P 5 .0007). At univariate analysis, ULCs (hazard ratio [HR] 2.349; confidence interval [CI] 1.364e4.044) were more powerful predictors than other echocardiographic variables of recognized prognostic value, including ejection fraction (HR 0.974; 95\% CI 0.958e0.99) and wall motion score index (HR 1.628; CI 1.15e2.304). On multivariable analysis, ULCs provided additional prognostic information (HR 1.9; 95\% CI 1.1e3.4) on diabetes (HR 2.05; 95\% CI 1.2e3.5) and New York Heart Association class (HR 1.3; 95\% CI 1.0e1.6). Conclusion: ULCs are a simple user-friendly, radiation-free bedside sign of extravascular lung water. They provide useful information for the prognostic stratification of patients with dyspnea and/or chest pain syndrome. (J Cardiac Fail 2007;13:830e835)},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The general guidelines on the management of ingested foreign bodies (FBs) do not address specific aspects raised by psychiatric patients,  particularly in patients with borderline personality disorders (BPD) who  repeatedly ingest FBs. The aim of this survey was to collect data on experience  and opinions on the management of FBs in psychiatric patients with BPD and to  review the relevant literature. METHODS: A survey focusing on the indication and  the timing of endoscopy for sharp FB removal in patients with BPD was e-mailed to  215 gastroenterologists, psychiatrists, and surgeons in Switzerland, Germany and  Austria, discussing this clinical problem using a specific case vignette.  RESULTS: Responses were received from 63 of 215 (29\%) contacted physicians.  Two-thirds of the respondents knew patients with BPD who had swallowed FBs  repeatedly; 86\% recommended removing sharp FBs endoscopically even in the case of  repeated FB ingestion and 14\% of respondents argued against emergent endoscopic  FB removal in the case of repeated ingestions. Different specialities expressed  partially divergent opinions regarding the management of these patients.  CONCLUSION: Repeated FB ingestions can be a problem in patients with BPD.  Although published data show that the perforation risk of unremoved FBs is low,  most clinicians support repeated endoscopies also in the case of repeated FB  ingestions. Nevertheless, in selected cases, repeated endoscopies need to be  discussed and an interdisciplinary consensus and/or the involvement of an ethical  committee is advised.},

  abstract = {Background: Accidental or intentional subcutaneous and/or intramuscular injection of metallic mercury is an uncommon form of poisoning. Although it does not carry the same risk as mercury vapour inhalation, it may cause destructive early and late reactions. Case Presentation: Herein we present the case of a 29-year-old male patient who developed an obsessive-compulsive disorder causing auto-aggressive behaviour with injection of elemental mercury and several other foreign bodies into the soft tissues around the left knee about 15 years before initial presentation. For clinical examination X-rays and a CT-scan of the affected area were performed. Furthermore, blood was taken to determine the mercury concentration in the blood, which showed a concentration 17-fold higher than recommended. As a consequence, the mercury depots and several foreign bodies were resected marginally. Conclusion: Blood levels of mercury will decrease rapidly following surgery, especially in combination with chelating therapy. In case of subcutaneous and intramuscular injection of metallic mercury we recommend marginal or wide excision of all contaminated tissue to prevent migration of mercury and chronic inflammation. Nevertheless, prolonged clinical and biochemical monitoring should be performed for several years to screen for chronic intoxication.},

The authors evaluated the accuracy of emergency physician (EP) performance of echocardiography in the assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and central venous pressure (CVP). Methods: The authors conducted a cross-sectional observational study at an urban teaching ED, involving a convenience sample of patients presenting to the ED between September 2000 and February 2001. Level III-credentialed EP sonographers who had undergone a three-hour training session in limited echocardiography, focusing on LVEF and CVP measurement, performed echocardiograms. Vital signs and indication for echocardiography were documented on a study data sheet. LVEF was rated as poor ({$<$}30\%), moderate (30\%-55\%), or normal ({$>$}55\%) and an absolute percentage. Central venous pressure categories included low ({$<$}5 cm), moderate (5-10 cm), and high ({$>$}10 cm). Formal echocardiograms were obtained within a four-hour window on all patients and interpreted by a staff cardiologist. Correlation analysis was performed using the ?? correlation coefficient for LVEF and CVP categories and a Pearson correlation coefficient for LVEF measurement. Results: A total of 115 patients were assessed for LVEF, and 94 patients had complete information for CVP. Indications for echocardiography included chest pain (45.1\%), congestive heart failure (38.1\%), dyspnea (5.7\%), and endocarditis (10.6\%). Results showed a LVEF correlation of r2 = 0.712 with 86.1\% overall agreement. Subgroup analysis revealed the highest agreement (92.3\%) between EP and formal echocardiograms within the normal LVEF category, followed by 70.4\% agreement in the poor LVEF category and 47.8\% in the moderate LVEF category. Central venous pressure measurements resulted in 70.2\% overall raw agreement between EP and formal echocardiograms. Subgroup analysis revealed the highest agreement (83.3\%) within the high CVP category followed by 66.6\% in the moderate and 20\% in the low categories. Conclusions: Experienced EP sonographers with a small amount of focused additional training in limited bedside echocardiography can assess LVEF accurately in the ED.},

  abstract = {Copper is an essential trace element that is involved in a number of important enzymatic processes throughout the body. Recent single case reports and small studies have shown that deficiency of copper can cause reversible haematological changes and irreversible neurological injury. We chose to undertake a national study, looking at all cases of copper deficiency in Scotland over a 5-yr period using information from a national reference laboratory. From 16 identified patients, we determined that 86\% had both haematological and neurological features of copper deficiency, while 18\% had haematological features only at presentation. Twelve of the sixteen patients had high serum zinc concentrations ({$>$}18 {$\mu$}m/L) nine patients were using zinc-containing dental fixatives at time of diagnosis. 94\% of patients had haematological features as an initial manifestation of copper deficiency, which included anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Patients who underwent later bone marrow testing had appearances in keeping with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, refractory anaemia with excess of blasts, unclassified marrow dysplasia or probable myelodysplasia (MDS). 75\% of patients had neurological symptoms or signs, including progressive walking difficulties and paraesthesia, or gait difficulties without sensory signs. Clinical examination was in keeping with spastic paraparesis (either with or without sensory neuropathy). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multifocal T2 hyper intense foci in the subcortical white matter, and atrophy of the cerebrum and cerebellum was also seen on computerised tomography (CT). MRI of the spinal cord showed signal change in the dorsal columns in either the cervical or thoracic cord. 93\% of cytopenias responded to copper replacement and addressing the original cause of the copper deficiency, but only 25\% of patients had improvement in their neurological function, while 33\% deteriorated and 42\% remained unchanged. Our study demonstrates that copper deficiency is an under-recognised cause of several types of cytopenia, which are reversible but can progress to significant neurological injury if left untreated. We illustrate the importance of identifying these patients early to prevent irreversible neurological injury.},

  abstract = {Background: Cardiac arrest is a critical condition affecting approximately 1 in every 1000 people in Europe. Feedback devices have been developed to enhance the quality of chest compressions during CPR, but their clinical impact remains uncertain. This study aims to evaluate the effect of feedback devices on key clinical outcomes in adult patients experiencing both out-of-hospital (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). The primary objective is to assess their impact on the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC); secondary objectives include the evaluation of neurological status and survival to discharge. Methods: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, utilizing databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase. Studies published between 2000 and 2023 comparing CPR with and without the use of feedback devices were included. A fixed-effects network meta-analysis was performed for ROSC and survival, while a frequentist meta-analysis was conducted for neurological outcomes. Results: Twelve relevant studies met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis results showed that the use of audiovisual feedback devices significantly increases the likelihood of ROSC (OR 1.26, 95\% CI 1.13-1.41, p {$<$} 0.0001) and survival (OR 1.52, 95\% CI 1.27-1.81, p {$<$} 0.0001) compared to CPR without feedback. However, the effect of metronomes did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Feedback devices, particularly audiovisual ones, are associated with improved clinical outcomes in cardiac arrest patients. Their use should be encouraged in both training settings and real-life emergency scenarios to enhance survival rates and ROSC. However, further studies are needed to confirm long-term impacts and to explore the potential benefits of metronomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Femur fractures are common among trauma patients and are typically seen in patients with multiple injuries resulting from high-energy mechanisms. Internal fixation with intramedullary nailing is the ideal method of treatment; however, there is no consensus regarding the optimal timing for internal fixation. We critically evaluated the literature regarding the benefit of early (G24 hours) versus late (924 hours) open reduction and internal fixation of open or closed femur fractures on mortality, infection, and venous thromboembolism (VTE) in trauma patients. Methods: A subcommittee of the Practice Management Guideline Committee of the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for the earlier question. RevMan software was used to generate forest plots. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology was used to rate the quality of the evidence, using GRADEpro software to create evidence tables. RESULTS: No significant reduction in mortality was associated with early stabilization, with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.74 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-1.08). The quality of evidence was rated as ''low.'' No significant reduction in infection (RR, 0.4; 95\% CI, 0.10-1.6) or VTE (RR, 0.63; 95\% CI, 0.37-1.07) was associated with early stabilization. The quality of evidence was rated ''low.'' Conclusion: In trauma patients with open or closed femur fractures, we suggest early (G24 hours) open reduction and internal fracture fixation. This recommendation is conditional because the strength of the evidence is low. Early stabilization of femur fractures shows a trend (statistically insignificant) toward lower risk of infection, mortality, and VTE. Therefore, the panel concludes the desirable effects of early femur fracture stabilization probably outweigh the undesirable effects in most patients.},

  abstract = {There is overwhelming evidence that sepsis and septic shock are associated with hyperlactatemia (sepsis-associated hyperlactatemia (SAHL)). SAHL is a strong independent predictor of mortality and its presence and progression are widely appreciated by clinicians to define a very high-risk population. Until recently, the dominant paradigm has been that SAHL is a marker of tissue hypoxia. Accordingly, SAHL has been interpreted to indicate the presence of an `oxygen debt' or `hypoperfusion', which leads to increased lactate generation via anaerobic glycolysis. In light of such interpretation of the meaning of SAHL, maneuvers to increase oxygen delivery have been proposed as its treatment. Moreover, lactate levels have been proposed as a method to evaluate the adequacy of resuscitation and the nature of the response to the initial treatment for sepsis. However, a large body of evidence has accumulated that strongly challenges such notions. Much evidence now supports the view that SAHL is not due only to tissue hypoxia or anaerobic glycolysis. Experimental and human studies all consistently support the view that SAHL is more logically explained by increased aerobic glycolysis secondary to activation of the stress response (adrenergic stimulation). More importantly, new evidence suggests that SAHL may actually serve to facilitate bioenergetic efficiency through an increase in lactate oxidation. In this sense, the characteristics of lactate production best fit the notion of an adaptive survival response that grows in intensity as disease severity increases. Clinicians need to be aware of these developments in our understanding of SAHL in order to approach patient management according to biological principles and to interpret lactate concentrations during sepsis resuscitation according to current best knowledge.},

  abstract = {Background: Ovarian teratoma is a rare tumor that occurs in dogs. Its origin comes from embryonic cells of the notochord and it is a unipotent tumor. Pyometra is the accumulation of purulent content in the uterine lumen. Cystic endometrial hyperplasia is one of the factors predisposing a dog to the development of pyometra. The safest and most efficient treatment for pyometra is ovariohysterectomy. The purpose of this report was to describe a case of ovarian teratoma and cystic endometrial hyperplasia with concomitant pyometra in a Labrador Retriever Bitch. Case: A 10-year-old bitch Labrador Retriever, weighing 42 kg, was evaluated at Animal Care Barueri Veterinary Clinic, in Barueri, Sao Paulo. The patient was referred from another veterinary service to our clinic for an ovariohysterectomy and removal of an intestinal foreign body as previous ultrasonography (US) had indicated the presence of pyometra and a foreign body in the descending colon (she had ingested cloth according to the owner's report). Laboratory tests, complete blood count, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, urea, and creatinine levels did not show any significant changes. Upon examination, the clinical signs were mucopurulent vaginal discharge, 5\% dehydration, rectal temperature 39.1 degrees C, mild abdominal pain on palpation, normophagy, normodipsia, and normal defecation and urination. Laboratory tests and a new US were requested on which the uterus was observed with the presence of luminal anechoic content and increased uterine diameter (uterine horns 3.97 cm), an acoustic intestinal shadow supposedly from a foreign body, and on the leukogram, leukocytosis (23,600/mm3) due to neutrophilia with a right shift (20,532/mm3) was observed. Therapeutic ovariohysterectomy and exploratory celiotomy were chosen as therapeutic options. Celiotomy with caudoumbilical mid ventral access was performed. When the left uterine horn was identified, an attempt was made to pull it in order to expose the left ovary, but this maneuver was not successful. For this reason, the abdominal incision was enlarged cranially. At that point, a huge mass was observed in the ovary (which was supposedly the acoustic shadow of the foreign body in the descending colon/left ovary). The intestines appeared normal. Macroscopically, the mass had an irregular surface, round shape, firm consistency, and was 15 cm long x 10 cm wide. Once removed, the mass was incised in the transversal direction, purulent content, hair, and mineralized areas inside it were observed. Histopathological examination showed neoplastic proliferation, consisting of cells with elongated epithelioid shape that were arranged in long irregular bundles among well-differentiated adipose tissue. An exuberant eosinophilic matrix with extensive cystic areas filled with lamellar keratin and hairy stems covered by squamous epithelium was also observed. Extensive areas exhibiting nervous tissue with minimal atypia are shown. The morphological picture was compatible with teratoma. Discussion: The present report describes the concomitant presence of ovarian teratoma and pyometra in a dog. The diagnosis of pyometra requires complementary tests (laboratory and imaging). The intestinal acoustic shadow observed on the two US images obtained by two different professionals was suggestive of intestinal foreign body but was also a wrong diagnosis, which was confirmed after an exploratory celiotomy when the mass in the left ovary was identified. On the histopathological examination of this present case, epithelial, nervous, and cartilaginous tissues were observed. This differentiation of tissues corroborated the teratoma diagnosis. Thus, the importance of an accurate diagnosis contributes to the resolution of a surgical conditions that may have had a poor prognosis when the procedure took a longer time to perform.},

We also searched the reference lists of included publications and for ongoing trials. The selection of relevant articles was conducted by two researchers at two levels of screening. Data collection followed the recommendations from the Cochrane Systematic Reviews Handbook. We used the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. Quality of the evidence was rated according to GRADE. RESULTS: The review identified six adult studies and no neonatal or pediatric studies. A descriptive analysis of study results was performed. Meta-analysis was not feasible due to heterogeneity. One study reported a reduction in sedation requirements with the use of music while the other five did not find any significant differences across groups. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review revealed limited evidence to support or refute the use of music to reduce sedation/analgesia requirements, or to reduce delirium in critically ill adults, and no evidence in pediatric and neonatal critically ill patients.},

On multivariable analysis, B-lines {$>$} 15 before discharge (hazard ratio [HR] 11.74; 95 \% confidence interval [CI] 1.30--106.16) was an independent predictor of events at 6 months. Conclusions: Persistent pulmonary congestion before discharge evaluated by ultrasound strongly predicts rehospitalization for HF at 6-months. Absence or a mild degree of B-lines identify a subgroup at extremely low risk to be readmitted for HF decompensation.},

Although different studies claim that migration could be a potential risk factor for self-harming behaviours, an in-depth exploration of the presence and characteristics of self-harm in the context of asylum is needed. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was conducted across the databases Scopus, PubMed, Web of Knowledge and PsycArticles, regarding the main features of self-harming behaviour among refugees in Europe. Twelve articles and 3 main trajectories were identified: (1)               A context at-risk: self-harm and detention centres               ; (2)               A target at-risk: self-harm and unaccompanied minors               ; (3)               A comparison between the mental health of asylum seekers and natives               . Research on this topic in Europe is still underdeveloped and disorganised. Studies have mainly carried out wider quantitative investigations on mental health, usually overlapping self-harm with suicide. Detention centres emerged as the most widely investigated context and the one with the highest risk for self-harming behaviours. Instead, unaccompanied minors emerged as a particularly vulnerable category. Research in this field should be improved, combining quantitative and qualitative methods for a deeper understanding of the meanings of self-harm across cultures.},

Minimally invasive esophagectomy represents a new alternative technique  to the conventional open approach. We wish to report our small case series of  minimally invasive esophagectomy and gastric pull-up in pediatric patients. The  aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of the  procedure. METHODS: Three patients (2 girls and 1 boy) with average age 46 months  (34-57 months) and average weight 12.6 kg (11-15 kg) underwent the procedure. The  indications for esophagectomy were esophageal stricture from caustic ingestion (2  patients) and failed repair of esophageal atresia (1 patient). RESULTS: Average  operative time was 7 h (0519-0752 hours). There were no intraoperative  complications with the average blood loss of 50 cc (5-125 cc). No anastomotic  leaks were noted on the initial esophagrams that were obtained on postoperative  day five or six. One patient developed a cervical wound infection on  postoperative day seven due to a retained piece of Penrose, which required a neck  exploration, removal of foreign body and repair of a small leak. One patient  developed an anastomotic stricture at the 7-month follow-up. She was successfully  treated with two balloon dilatations. One patient developed a delayed  esophagogastric anastomotic leak at 3 months. The leak spontaneously closed after  surgical drainage. At average of 22-month follow-up (15-36 months), all patients  were eating regular food with excellent weight gain. CONCLUSION: Minimally  invasive esophagectomy and gastric pull-up is technically challenging but  feasible and safe with acceptable outcomes. However, further study is needed to  further validate the approach.},

Results: A 1 L increase of prehospital i.v. fluid was associated with a 7\% decrease of shock index in the emergency department (p {$<$} 0.001). Volumes of 0.5--1 L and 1--2 L were associated with reduced likelihood of shock as compared to volumes of 0--0.5 L: OR 0.61 (p = 0.03) and OR 0.54 (p = 0.02), respectively. Volumes of 1--2 L were also associated with an increased likelihood of receiving blood transfusion in ED: OR 3.27 (p {$<$} 0.001). Patients who had received volumes of {$>$}2 L have a much greater likelihood of receiving blood transfusion in ED: OR 9.92 (p {$<$} 0.001). Mortality at 24 h was not associated with prehospital i.v. fluids. Conclusion: In hypotensive trauma patients, prehospital i.v. fluids were associated with a reduction of likelihood of shock upon arrival in ED. However, volumes of {$>$}1 L were associated with a markedly increased likelihood of receiving blood transfusion in ED. Therefore, decision making regarding prehospital i.v. fluid resuscitation is critical and may need to be tailored to the individual situation. Further research is needed to clarify whether a causal relationship exists between prehospital i.v. fluid volume and blood transfusion. Also, prospective trials on prehospital i.v. fluid resuscitation strategies in specific patient subgroups (e.g. traumatic brain injury and concomitant haemorrhage) are warranted. {\ss} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the leading cause of sepsis. In 2016, the 3rd International Consensus Conference for Sepsis released the Quick Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) to identify risk for poor outcomes in sepsis. OBJECTIVE: We sought to externally validate qSOFA in emergency department (ED) patients with pneumonia and compare the accuracy of qSOFA to systemic inflammatory response syndrome score (SIRS), Confusion, Respiratory Rate and Blood~Pressure (CRB), Confusion, Respiratory Rate, Blood Pressure and Age (CRB-65), and DS CRB-65, which is based on the~CRB-65 score and includes two additional items-presence of underlying comorbid disease and blood oxygen saturation. METHODS: A subgroup analysis of U.S. Critical Illness and Injury Trials Group (USCIITG-Lung Injury Prevention Study [LIPS]; ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT00889772) prospective cohort. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were measures of intensive care unit (ICU) utilization. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were reported. RESULTS: From March to August 2009, 5584 patients were enrolled; 713 met inclusion criteria. Median age was 61~years (interquartile range 49-75~years). SIRS criteria had the highest sensitivity for death (89\%) and lowest specificity (25\%), while CRB had the highest specificity (88\%) and lowest sensitivity (31\%), followed by qSOFA (80\% and 53\%, respectively). This trend was maintained for the secondary outcomes. There was no significant difference in the AUC for death using qSOFA (AUC 0.75; 95\% confidence interval~[CI] 0.66-0.84), SIRS (AUC 0.70; 95\% CI 0.61-0.78), CRB (AUC 0.71; 95\% CI 0.62-0.80), CRB-65 (AUC 0.71; 95\% CI 0.63-0.80), and DS CRB-65 (AUC 0.73; 95\% CI 0.64-0.82). CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter observational study of ED patients hospitalized with pneumonia, we found no significant differences between qSOFA and SIRS for predicting in-hospital death. In addition, several popular~pneumonia-specific severity scores performed nearly identically to qSOFA score in predicting death and ICU utilization. Validation is needed in a larger sample.},

In literature, various systemic toxic syndromes associated with mushroom poisoning have been described. We report four members of a family with muscarinic manifestations after accidental consumption of poisonous mushrooms. The Clitocybe species of mushrooms they consumed resulted in their muscarinic toxicity. Patients with muscarinic mushroom toxicity have early onset of symptoms and they respond well to atropine and symptomatic supportive care.},

The aim of this paper is to report the management and the outcomes in 67 patients admitted for suspected ingestion of foreign body between December 2012 and December 2014. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at Palermo University Hospitals, Italy, over a 2-year period. We reviewed patients' database (age, sex, type of foreign body and its anatomical location, treatments, and outcomes as complications, success rates, and mortalities). RESULTS: Foreign bodies were found in all of our 67 patients. Almost all were found in the stomach and lower esophagus (77~\%). The types of foreign body were very different, but they were chiefly meat boluses, fishbones or cartilages, button battery and dental prostheses. In all patients it was possible to endoscopically remove the foreign body. Complications related to the endoscopic procedure were unfrequent (about 7~\%) and have been treated conservatively. 5.9~\% of patients had previous esophageal or laryngeal surgery, and 8.9~\% had an underlying esophageal disease, such as a narrowing, dismotility or achalasia. CONCLUSION: Our experience with foreign bodies and food impaction emphasizes the importance of endoscopic approach and removal, simple and secure when performed by experienced hands and under conscious sedation in most cases. High success rates, lower incidence of minor complications, reduction of the need of surgery and reduced hospitalization time are the strengths of the endoscopic approach.},

Radiological examinations play a crucial role in  determining the exact location of the object within the gastrointestinal tract  and in planning for its removal by endoscopic or surgical intervention. METHODS:  Medical and radiological records of 8 patients who had swallowed the broken heads  or entire toothbrush were retrospectively reviewed. This series included 4 men  and 4 women, ranging in age from 21 to 57 years (mean: 34 years). RESULTS:  Radiographs and computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated the ingested  toothbrushes within the stomach in 3, lodged in the duodenum in 1, and entrapped  in various parts of the colon in 4 patients. They were removed by laparotomy in  3, laparoscopy in 2, colonoscopy in 2, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in 1  patient. There were no perforations or associated complications, and all patients  had uneventful recoveries. CONCLUSIONS: Ingested toothbrushes can be easily  identified on radiological studies because of the radiopaque wires holding the  nylon bristles. The plastic parts of it, however, are only visible on computed  tomography. All cases would require endoscopic or surgical removal of the  retained toothbrushes because spontaneous passage per rectum does not occur.},

We have studied prospectively the effect of femoral reaming on the inflammatory process as implicated in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple-organ failure (MOF). We studied changes in the levels of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) (proinflammatory cytokine), neutrophil CD11b (C3) receptor expression (activated neutrophil adhesion molecule), serum soluble intracellular adhesion molecule (s-ICAM-1), serum soluble E-selectin (the soluble products of endothelial adhesion molecules) and plasma elastase (neutrophil protease) in a series of patients with femoral fractures treated by nailing. We have also compared reamed nailing with unreamed nailing. We found that the levels of serum IL-6 and elastase rose significantly during the nailing procedure indicating a measurable 'second hit'. There was no clear response in leukocyte activation and no difference in the release of endothelial adhesion molecule markers. There was no significant difference between groups treated by reamed and unreamed nailing. Although clinically unremarkable, the one patient who died from ARDS was shown to be hyperstimulated after injury and again after nailing, suggesting the importance of an excessive inflammatory reaction in the pathogenesis of these serious problems. Our findings have shown that there is a second hit associated with femoral nailing and suggest that the degree of the inflammatory reaction may be important in the pathogenesis of ARDS and MOF.},

A minority of FB ingestions are  not identified for weeks to years and present significant problems for retrieval.  The purpose of this study was to describe the diagnostic and therapeutic  strategies needed to care for children who have chronic esophageal FBs. METHODS:  Five children were identified as having retained esophageal FBs 2 months to 2  years after ingestion. During the same 3-year period, 100 children who had acute  FBs were identified and had their foreign bodies removed endoscopically. The  average age of the children was 3 years (range, 2.4 to 3.5). RESULTS: The average  age of the five children identified in this study was 3 years. The items ingested  included coins, a heart pendant, a clothespin spring, and a toy soldier.  Complications from chronically retained foreign bodies were bronchoesophageal  fistula, mediastinitis, esophageal diverticulum, and lobar atelectasis. One  patient died from an aortoesophageal fistula. In all children, endoscopic removal  was attempted. Barium esophagram was then performed, and foreign bodies were  eventually removed via right thoracotomy. CONCLUSIONS: Long-retained esophageal  FBs are extremely morbid and life threatening. History most often identifies  excess salivation, new onset asthma, and/or recurrent upper respiratory  infections. Three diagnostic adjuncts are helpful in identifying the presence of  a long retained FB: (1) Chest x-ray (PA and lateral), (2) barium swallow, and (3)  esophagoscopy. Indications for thoracotomy for removal of foreign body include  (1) Poor endoscopic visualization of FB because of inflammatory tissue and (2)  Herald bleeding during endoscopy.},

The purpose of this study was to characterize the use of such drugs and evaluate their relationship to cardiac arrest outcomes. Methods and results: The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Registry-Cardiac Arrest collects out-ofhospital cardiac arrest data from 264 Emergency Medical Services agencies in 11 geographical locations in the US and Canada. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between drug use, characteristics of the cardiac arrest and a pulse at emergency department arrival and survival to discharge. A total of 16,221 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests were attended by 74 Emergency Medical Services agencies. There was a considerable variability in the administration of amiodarone and lidocaine for the treatment of shock resistant ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. For non-shockable rhythms, atropine use ranged from 29 to 95\% and sodium bicarbonate use ranged from 0.2 to 73\% across agencies in the 89\% of agencies that used the drug. Epinephrine use ranged from 57 to 98\% within agencies. Neither lidocaine nor amiodarone was associated with a survival benefit while there was an inverse relationship between the administration of epinephrine, atropine and sodium bicarbonate and survival to hospital discharge. Conclusions: There is considerable variability among Emergency Medical Services agencies in their use of pharmacological therapy for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests which may be resolved by performing large randomized trials examining effects on survival.},

We tested the hypothesis that these ``oldest'' RBCs are associated with adverse outcomes. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In a retrospective study, 28,247 transfused patients given 129,483 RBC units were assessed. Morbidity, mortality, and length of stay (LOS) were compared in patients transfused exclusively with RBCs stored not more than 21 days versus patients transfused exclusively with RBCs stored 28 days or more and patients transfused exclusively with RBCs stored 35 days or more. RESULTS: After risk adjustment,  35-day RBCs were associated with increased morbidity (adjusted odds ratio [adjOR], 1.19; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.32; p 5 0.002), but  28-day RBCs were not (adjOR, 1.06; 95\% CI, 0.97-1.15; p 5 0.2). Neither  35-day nor  28day RBCs were associated with increased mortality. In critically ill patients,  35-day RBCs were associated with increased morbidity (adjOR, 1.25; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.44; p 5 0.002) and mortality (adjOR, 1.38; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.74; p 5 0.009), but  28-day RBCs were associated with neither. In older patients,  35-day RBCs were associated with increased morbidity (adjOR, 1.22; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.42; p 5 0.01), but not mortality (adjOR, 1.28; 95\% CI, 0.96-1.71; p 5 0.1), and  28-day RBCs were associated with neither. LOS was increased for both  28- and  35-day RBCs for all patients and the critically ill and older subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: RBCs transfused in the last 7 days of their 42-day storage limit may be associated with adverse clinical outcomes in high-risk patients.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Ingesting a foreign body (FB) is not an uncommon occurrence. Most pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract uneventfully, and perforation is rare. The aim of this study was to report our experience with ingested FB perforations of the GI tract treated surgically at our institution. METHODS: A total of 62 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for an ingested FB perforation of the GI tract between 1990 and 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. Three patients with no definite FB demonstrated intraoperatively were included. RESULTS: The patients had a median age of 58 years, and 37 (60\%) were male. Of the 59 FBs recovered, 55 (93\%) were toothpicks and dietary FBs such as fish bones or bone fragments. A definitive preoperative history of FB ingestion was obtained for only two patients, and 36 of 52 patients (69\%) wore dentures. Altogether, 18 (29\%) perforations occurred in the anus or distal rectum, and 44 perforations were intraabdominal, with the most common abdominal site being the distal ileum (39\%). Patients with FB perforations in the stomach, duodenum, and large intestine were significantly more likely to be afebrile (P = 0.043), to have chronic symptoms ({$>$} 3 days) (P {$<$} 0.001), to have a normal total white blood cell count (P {$<$} 0.001), and to be asymptomatic or present with an abdominal mass or abscess (P {$<$} 0.001) compared to those with FB perforations in the jejunum and ileum. CONCLUSIONS: Ingested FB perforation in the adult population is most commonly secondary to unconscious accidental ingestion and is frequently caused by dietary FBs especially fish bones. A preoperative history of FB ingestion is thus rarely obtained, although wearing dentures is a common risk factor. FB perforations of the stomach, duodenum, and large intestine tend to present with a longer, more innocuous clinical picture than perforations in the jejunum or ileum.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: As part of the oral phase of development, children commonly ingest foreign bodies. The most common lodged foreign body, requiring operative removal,  in the United States is the penny. Valued at 1 cent, comprised of materials  valued at less than 1 cent, costing 1.62 cents to manufacture, and being never  removed from circulation, pennies are aplenty. But ingestion can lead to mucosal  damage, the consequences of which can be esophageal perforation or stricture  formation. We hypothesize that the monetary value of the penny is far less than  the cost of its ingestion and removal. This quality assurance study examines the  effect of the penny on the purse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective review  identified 180 foreign bodies in children under the age of 18 over a five year  period. Eighty-two were pennies. Operative notes revealed degree of injury.  Hospital charge assessments revealed the "cost" of each visit. RESULTS: There  were no esophageal perforations, and cases were divided evenly among injury  grades 0-III. The average total charge for all penny-related injuries was  \$7164.78. CONCLUSIONS: The purpose was to examine the actual cost of a penny  (more than its value in production) and the potential cost of its damage  (thousands of dollars in measurable costs, untold immeasurable costs). The goal  of this study is to draw healthcare professional and public attention to a  potentially serious and yet highly preventable injury in young children.},

Although the current view suggests that endovascular stent-graft treatment is  useful for AEF, whether a subsequent thoracic operation is necessary remains  controversial. The purpose of this report is to describe our experience using  endovascular stent-graft treatment without combined thoracic operations for the  treatment of AEF in two specific cases. CASE SUMMARY: We presented two cases of  patients complaining of retrosternal discomfort treated in our department for an  aortoesophageal fistula caused by the accidental ingestion of a fishbone. The two  patients were effectively managed with combined means of endoscopic, medical  (broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, fasting, gastrointestinal decompression,  etc.) and endovascular stent-graft treatment. The main difference in treatment  was that the first patient presented with hematemesis after endoscopic removal of  the fishbone. Subsequently, the patient underwent endovascular stent-graft  treatment. The second case was managed with endoscopic removal of the fishbone  with simultaneous endovascular stent-graft treatment, without any signs of  hematemesis or melena. Both patients had successful postoperative management and  were discharged home. Long-term follow-up is ongoing. CONCLUSION: The treatment  decision-making process should depend on the patients' specific situations. Our  practice indicates that endovascular stent-graft treatment without combined  thoracic operations could be a valuable alternative in selected patients.},

  abstract = {Objective: Unusual clinical course Background: Unintentional medication-blister ingestion is rare but frequently leads to intestinal perforation. The diagnosis of intestinal perforation following blister ingestion is often delayed because of an unreliable history and nonspecific clinical presentation. The purpose of this case report is to raise awareness about a rare but difficult diagnosis and its importance in avoiding potentially fatal events. Case Reports: Herein, we describe successful cases of surgical and endoscopic removal after blister ingestion. The first case was that of a polymorbid 75-year-old man who presented with acute onset of abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant and epigastric regions. No indication of the cause was observed on initial computed tomography (CT). The patient developed an acute abdomen, and emergency laparotomy was performed, during which 2 small perforations were observed in the terminal ileum, and an empty tablet blister was retrieved. The second patient was a 55-year-old man who presented with a considerable lack of awareness. On the initial CT, a subdural hematoma, aspiration, and an unidentified foreign body in the stomach were observed. Gastroscopy was performed after emergency craniotomy. In addition to the initial foreign body, a second object, which had gone unnoticed on the initial CT, was found and removed from the esophagus. Conclusions: With an increased risk of perforation and difficult clinical and radiological diagnoses, prophylactic measures and special awareness of high-risk patients are particularly important.},

  abstract = {Binaural beats are an auditory phenomenon that has been suggested to alter physiological and cognitive processes including vigilance and brainwave entrainment. Some personality traits measured by the NEO Five Factor Model have been found to alter entrainment using pulsing light stimuli, but as yet no studies have examined if this occurs using steady state presentation of binaural beats for a relatively short presentation of two minutes. This study aimed to examine if binaural beat stimulation altered vigilance or cortical frequencies and if personality traits were involved. Thirty-one participants were played binaural beat stimuli designed to elicit a response at either the Theta (7 Hz) or Beta (16 Hz) frequency bands while undertaking a zero-back vigilance task. EEG was recorded from a high-density electrode cap. No significant differences were found in vigilance or cortical frequency power during binaural beat stimulation compared to a white noise control period. Furthermore, no significant relationships were detected between the above and the Big Five personality traits. This suggests a short presentation of steady state binaural beats are not sufficient to alter vigilance or entrain cortical frequencies at the two bands examined and that certain personality traits were not more susceptible than others.},

Surgical treatment of these injuries is challenging and have a considerable learning curve. Studies comparing operative with nonoperative treatment including randomized trials and meta-analyses are fraught with a considerable number of confounders including highly variable fracture patterns, soft-tissue conditions, patient characteristics, surgeon experience, limited sensitivity of outcome measures, and rehabilitation protocols. It has become apparent that there is no single treatment that is suitable for all calcaneal fractures. Treatment should be tailored to the individual fracture pathoanatomy, accompanying soft- tissue damage, associated injuries, functional demand, and comorbidities of the patient. If operative treatment is chosen, reconstruction of the overall shape of the calcaneum and joint surfaces are of utmost importance to obtain a good functional result. Despite meticulous reconstruction, primary cartilage damage due to the impact at the time of injury may lead to posttraumatic subtalar arthritis. Even if subtalar fusion becomes necessary, patients benefit from primary anatomical reconstruction of the hindfoot geometry because in situ fusion is easier to perform and associated with better results than corrective fusion for hindfoot deformities in malunited calcaneal fractures. To minimize wound healing problems and stiffness due to scar formation after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) through extensile approaches several percutaneous and less invasive procedures through a direct approach over the sinus tarsi have successfully lowered the rates of infections and wound complications while ensuring exact anatomic reduction. There is evidence from multiple studies that malunited displaced calcaneal fractures result in painful arthritis and disabling, three-dimensional foot deformities for the affected patients. The poorest treatment results are reported after open surgical treatment that failed to achieve anatomic reconstruction of the calcaneum and its joints, thus combining the disadvantages of operative and nonoperative treatment. The crucial question, therefore, is not only whether to operate or not but also when and how to operate on calcaneal fractures if surgery is decided. Keywords:},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of early vasopressin vs norepinephrine on kidney failure in patients with septic shock. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A factorial (2{\texttimes}2), double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted in 18 general adult intensive care units in the United Kingdom between February 2013 and May 2015, enrolling adult patients who had septic shock requiring vasopressors despite fluid resuscitation within a maximum of 6 hours after the onset of shock. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly allocated to vasopressin (titrated up to 0.06 U/min) and hydrocortisone (n = 101), vasopressin and placebo (n = 104), norepinephrine and hydrocortisone (n = 101), or norepinephrine and placebo (n = 103). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was kidney failure--free days during the 28-day period after randomization, measured as (1) the proportion of patients who never developed kidney failure and (2) median number of days alive and free of kidney failure for patients who did not survive, who experienced kidney failure, or both. Rates of renal replacement therapy, mortality, and serious adverse events were secondary outcomes. RESULTS A total of 409 patients (median age, 66 years; men, 58.2\%) were included in the study, with a median time to study drug administration of 3.5 hours after diagnosis of shock. The number of survivors who never developed kidney failure was 94 of 165 patients (57.0\%) in the vasopressin group and 93 of 157 patients (59.2\%) in the norepinephrine group (difference, -2.3\% [95\% CI, -13.0\% to 8.5\%]). The median number of kidney failure--free days for patients who did not survive, who experienced kidney failure, or both was 9 days (interquartile range [IQR], 1 to --24) in the vasopressin group and 13 days (IQR, 1 to --25) in the norepinephrine group (difference, -4 days [95\% CI, -11 to 5]). There was less use of renal replacement therapy in the vasopressin group than in the norepinephrine group (25.4\% for vasopressin vs 35.3\% for norepinephrine; difference, -9.9\% [95\% CI, -19.3\% to -0.6\%]). There was no significant difference in mortality rates between groups. In total, 22 of 205 patients (10.7\%) had a serious adverse event in the vasopressin group vs 17 of 204 patients (8.3\%) in the norepinephrine group (difference, 2.5\% [95\% CI, -3.3\% to 8.2\%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with septic shock, the early use of vasopressin compared with norepinephrine did not improve the number of kidney failure--free days. Although these findings do not support the use of vasopressin to replace norepinephrine as initial treatment in this situation, the confidence interval included a potential clinically important benefit for vasopressin, and larger trials may be warranted to assess this further.},

Levosimendan (Simdax                 {\textregistered}                 ; Orion Pharma, Newbury, UK) is a calcium-sensitising drug with inotropic and other properties that may have a role in sepsis.                                                        Objectives               To determine, in adult septic shock, whether or not levosimendan reduces the incidence and severity of acute organ dysfunction, the effect of levosimendan on individual organ function and the safety profile of levosimendan.                                         Design               Multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study.                                         Setting               UK intensive care units.                                         Participants               Adult patients with sepsis and cardiovascular failure requiring vasopressors to maintain blood pressure despite adequate fluid resuscitation.                                         Intervention               Levosimendan, at a dosage of 0.05--0.2\,{\textmu}g/kg/minute, compared with placebo for 24 hours, in addition to standard care, within 24 hours of meeting inclusion criteria.                                         Main outcome measure               The primary outcome was mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on the intensive care unit after randomisation to a maximum of 28 days. Secondary outcomes were time to extubation, survival up to 6 months and serious adverse events.                                         Results               In total, 2382 patients were screened at 34 centres, of whom 516 were randomised to treatment, 259 to levosimendan and 257 to placebo. Baseline characteristics were well balanced across treatment arms. There was no significant difference in mean\,{\textpm}\,standard deviation (SD) SOFA score between the levosimendan group (6.7, SD 4.0) and the placebo group (6.1, SD 3.9) [mean difference 0.61, 95\% confidence interval (CI) --0.07 to 1.29]. The 28-day mortality rate was 34.5\% and 30.9\% in the levosimendan and placebo groups, respectively (absolute difference 3.6\%, 95\% CI --4.5\% to 11.7\%). Patients in the levosimendan group were less likely to be successfully extubated over 28 days than patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.77, 95\% CI 0.60 to 0.97). More patients in the levosimendan group had supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (3.1\% vs. 0.4\%; absolute difference 2.7\%, 95\% CI 0.1\% to 5.3\%), but there was no overall difference in serious adverse events.                                         Conclusions               In the population of septic shock patients randomised to treatment in this study, the addition of levosimendan to standard medical care did not reduce organ dysfunction or mortality. Levosimendan was associated with a reduced likelihood of successful extubation and an increased risk of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.                                         Limitations               This was a trial of levosimendan added to standard care rather than a comparison against an alternative inotrope such as dobutamine. No echocardiographic analyses were performed to provide detailed information about changes in myocardial function; therefore, this trial cannot provide guidance as to which inotrope (if any) is best to use in the management of sepsis if a very low cardiac index is present.                                         Future work               Levosimendan could be compared against dobutamine and placebo in patients with a very low cardiac output in sepsis to test which, if any, inotrope should be used in this select group.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Levosimendan is a calcium-sensitizing drug with inotropic and other properties that may improve outcomes in patients with sepsis. METHODS We conducted a double-blind, randomized clinical trial to investigate whether levosimendan reduces the severity of organ dysfunction in adults with sepsis. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a blinded infusion of levosimendan (at a dose of 0.05 to 0.2 {$\mu$}g per kilogram of body weight per minute) for 24 hours or placebo in addition to standard care. The primary outcome was the mean daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score in the intensive care unit up to day 28 (scores for each of five systems range from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more severe dysfunction; maximum score, 20). Secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality, time to weaning from mechanical ventilation, and adverse events. RESULTS The trial recruited 516 patients; 259 were assigned to receive levosimendan and 257 to receive placebo. There was no significant difference in the mean ({\textpm}SD) SOFA score between the levosimendan group and the placebo group (6.68{\textpm}3.96 vs. 6.06{\textpm}3.89; mean difference, 0.61; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -0.07 to 1.29; P\,=\,0.053). Mortality at 28 days was 34.5\% in the levosimendan group and 30.9\% in the placebo group (absolute difference, 3.6 percentage points; 95\% CI, -4.5 to 11.7; P\,=\,0.43). Among patients requiring ventilation at baseline, those in the levosimendan group were less likely than those in the placebo group to be successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation over the period of 28 days (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.60 to 0.97; P\,=\,0.03). More patients in the levosimendan group than in the placebo group had supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (3.1\% vs. 0.4\%; absolute difference, 2.7 percentage points; 95\% CI, 0.1 to 5.3; P\,=\,0.04). CONCLUSIONS The addition of levosimendan to standard treatment in adults with sepsis was not associated with less severe organ dysfunction or lower mortality. Levosimendan was associated with a lower likelihood of successful weaning from mechanical ventilation and a higher risk of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia.

Severe cases of serotonin syndrome, also called serotonin toxicity, are characterized by neuromuscular excitation (clonus, hyperre flexia, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor), autonomic stimulation (hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, flushing), and altered mental state (anxiety, agitation, confusion). These more severe cases may come to the clinician's attention on an emergency basis. The diagnosis of serotonin syndrome should be considered in a patient presenting with any combination of clonus, myoclonus, rigidity, and/or tremor. Serotonin syndrome is associated with the use of one or more serotonergic agents. Severe cases generally occur with combinations of serotonergic drugs, most commonly including a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Excessive serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the central nervous system has been implicated. Certain patient populations may be predisposed to developing serotonin toxicity, based on their use of various medications or other substances with serotonergic properties. When evaluating a patient with clinical features of neuromuscular excitation, autonomic stimulation, and/or altered mental state, prompt identification and management are critical, and treatment considerations are often complex.},

An early review published in Physiological Reviews over 40 yr ago (Wolthuis et al. Physiol Rev 54: 566--595, 1974) focused on the use of LBNP as a tool to study effects of central hypovolemia, while more than a decade ago a review appeared that focused on LBNP as a model of hemorrhagic shock (Cooke et al. J Appl Physiol (1985) 96: 1249--1261, 2004). Since then there has been a great deal of new research that has applied LBNP to investigate complex physiological responses to a variety of challenges including orthostasis, hemorrhage, and other important stressors seen in humans such as microgravity encountered during spaceflight. The LBNP stimulus has provided novel insights into the physiology underlying areas such as intolerance to reduced central blood volume, sex differences concerning blood pressure regulation, autonomic dysfunctions, adaptations to exercise training, and effects of space flight. Furthermore, approaching cardiovascular assessment using prediction models for orthostatic capacity in healthy populations, derived from LBNP tolerance protocols, has provided important insights into the mechanisms of orthostatic hypotension and central hypovolemia, especially in some patient populations as well as in healthy subjects. This review also presents a concise discussion of mathematical modeling regarding compensatory responses induced by LBNP. Given the diverse applications of LBNP, it is to be expected that new and innovative applications of LBNP will be developed to explore the complex physiological mechanisms that underline health and disease.},

We retrospectively reviewed 87 consecutive cases of foreign body ingestion. In 49 patients the ingested foreign body had passed beyond the gastroesophageal junction, and these cases form the basis of this study. Of the 49 patients, 19 (38.7\%) required surgical intervention for removal of the swallowed object. Nearly 75\% of these patients had swallowed objects that were more than 6.5 cm in length. Of 30 adults, more than 50\% required surgery for removal of the foreign body. However, fewer than 16\% of children who had swallowed and retained foreign bodies required surgery for ultimate cure. Based on these findings, guidelines are presented for the management of foreign body ingestion.},

After management, stability of the chest wall occurred in 85\% of the patients in the surgical group. Forty-five percent of patients in this group required ventilatory support after fixation for an average of 2 days. Whereas in the conservative group, stability occurred in 50\% of their patients, and 35\% of patients required ventilatory support for an average of 12 days. Chest wall deformity in the form of stove-in chest and crowding of ribs was still obvious in 9 patients among the conservatively treated group, compared to only one patient who developed chest wall deformity in the surgically treated group. The pulmonary functions tested two months after management indicated that in the surgical group the patients had a significantly less restrictive pattern. Thus, surgical fixation of a flail segment is a method of great value in the treatment of flail chest, in which stability is achieved without deformity of the chest wall and patients have less restrictive impairment of pulmonary functions.},

One key issue for treatment success is early administration. While usually given intravenously, oral and intramuscular use would be useful in specific circumstances. Therefore, an understanding of TXA pharmacokinetics when given via different routes is valuable. The aim of this study was to perform an individual participant data meta-analysis of pharmacokinetic studies with TXA given to healthy volunteers via different routes. We searched the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Wiley Online Library, Elsevier Science Direct and J-STAGE. Individual subject data were extracted when available, otherwise arithmetic means were used. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using nonlinear mixed effect modelling. Seven studies were included in the analysis with data from 10 patients for the IV route, six patients for the IM route and 114 patients for the oral route. The pharmacokinetics was ascribed to a two-compartment model, and the main covariate was allometrically scaled bodyweight. Oral and IM bioavailabilities were 46 and 105\%, respectively. For a 70 kg bodyweight, the population estimates were 7.6 L/h for clearance, 17.9 L for the volume of the central compartment, 2.5 L/h for the diffusional clearance and 16.6 L for the peripheral volume of distribution. Larger well-designed studies are needed to describe the pharmacokinetics of TXA when given IM or as an oral solution before these can be recommended as alternatives to IV.},

Features of copper deficiency include hematologic abnormalities (anemia, neutropenia, and leukopenia) and myeloneuropathy; the latter is a rarer and often unrecognized complication of copper deficiency. We here describe two patients who presented with severe gait abnormalities and anemia combined with neutropenia several years after roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery for obesity who were found to be severely copper deficient. Intravenous copper repletion resulted in the rapid correction of hematologic indices; combined intravenous and oral copper supplementation and eventual oral copper supplements alone normalized serum copper levels in each patient but resulted in only partial resolution of the neurologic deficits. This report serves to alert physicians of the association between RYGB procedures and subsequent copper deficiency in order to avoid diagnostic delays and to improve treatment outcomes.},

OBJECTIVE: To identify and define patients at high risk for recurrent foreign body ingestion. Methods: A retrospective chart review of foreign body ingestion was conducted at a tertiary care medical centre over an 11-year period. Variables analyzed included age, sex, incarceration status, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV diagnosis, success of endoscopy, type of sedation used, method of extraction, complications, presence of gastrointestinal pathology, and incidence of recurrent food impaction or foreign body. Results: A total of 159 patients with a foreign body ingestion were identified. One hundred fourteen (77\%) experienced a single episode of ingestion and 45 (23\%) experienced multiple ingestions. Of the patients with multiple ingestions, 27 (60\%) had recurrent food impactions while 18 (40\%) ingested foreign objects. In the recurrent ingestor group, a psychiatric disorder had been diagnosed in 16 patients (35.6\%) and there were 13 incarcerated individuals (28.9\%). The average number of recurrences was 2.6 per patient (117 total recurrences). Individuals with a psychiatric disorder experienced 3.9 recurrences per patient, while prisoners averaged 4.1 recurrences per patient. The combination of a psychiatric disorder and being incarcerated was associated with the highest recurrence rate (4.33 per patient). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that male sex (OR 2.9; P=0.022), being incarcerated (OR 3.0; P=0.024) and the presence of a psychiatric disorder (OR 2.5; P=0.03) were risk factors for recurrent ingestion. Conclusion: Risk factors for recurrent ingestion of foreign bodies were male sex, being incarcerated and the presence of a psychiatric disorder.},

Unfortunately, these procedures can be complicated by high rates of  recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, tracheal stenosis, recurrent fistula and  significant patient mortality. Thus, several authors have advocated the use of  esophageal rest as conservative management of acquired TEF to permit closure by  secondary intention. This study describes a patient with spontaneous closure of  an acquired TEF following disc-battery ingestion. The late recurrence of the TEF  following conservative management, and endoscopic and radiographic evidence of  closure, illustrates the importance of long term evaluation before assuming  fistula resolution. Practitioners must carefully weigh the risks and benefits  before deciding surgical versus conservative management of TEF. An extended  follow-up of at least 6 months should be instituted with a high index of  suspicion if conservative management is utilized. Transtracheal repair using an  imbricated suture technique is a good surgical option when conservative  management fails.},

Fifty-two spontaneously breathing, cooperative patients with free-flowing effusions obliterating more than half of the hemidiaphragm on an upright, posteroanterior chest roentgenogram were randomized. When we analyzed those complications that were potentially life-threatening (eg, pneumothorax) and/or placed patients at increased risk for further morbidity (eg, pneumothorax, dry tap, inadequate tap), the sonography-guided method was associated with significantly fewer serious complications (0 of 19) than the needle-catheter (9 of 18) or needle-only methods (5 of 15). The sonography-guided method was associated with fewer pneumothoraces (0 of 19) than the needle-catheter (7 of 18) or needle-only methods (3 of 15). The difference between needle-catheter and needle-only methods was not significant. From our results, we conclude that the method by which thoracentesis was performed significantly influenced the spectrum and frequency of complications, and the sonography-guided method was the safest.},

  abstract = {The term `severely injured patient' is often synonymous of polytrauma patient, multiply-injured patient or, in some settings, polyfractured patient. Together with brain trauma, copious bleeding is the most severe complication of polytrauma. Consequently hypotension develop. Then, the perfusion of organs may be compromised, with the risk of organ failure. Treatment of chest bleeding after trauma is essential and is mainly addressed via surgical manoeuvres. As in the case of lesions to the pelvis, abdomen or extremities, this approach demonstrates the application of damage control (DC). The introduction of sonography has dramatically changed the diagnosis and prognosis of abdominal bleeding. In stable patients, a contrast CT-scan should be performed before any x-ray projection, because, in an emergency situation, spinal or pelvic fractures be missed by conventional radiological studies. Fractures or dislocation of the pelvis causing enlargement of the pelvic cavity, provoked by an anteroposterior trauma, and in particular cases presenting vertical instability, are the most severe types and require fast stabilisation by closing the pelvic ring diameter to normal dimensions and by stabilising the vertical shear. Controversy still exists about whether angiography or packing should be used as the first choice to address active bleeding after pelvic ring closure. Pelvic angiography plays a significant complementary role to pelvic packing for final haemorrhage control. Apart from pelvic trauma, fracture of the femur is the only fracture provoking acute life-threatening bleeding. If possible, femur fractures should be immobilised immediately, either by external fixation or by a sheet wrap around both extremities.},

  abstract = {Background. Evidence is accumulating that pesticide self-poisoning is one of the most commonly used methods of suicide worldwide, but the magnitude of the problem and the global distribution of these deaths is unknown. Methods. We have systematically reviewed the worldwide literature to estimate the number of pesticide suicides in each of the World Health Organisation's six regions and the global burden of fatal self-poisoning with pesticides. We used the following data sources: Medline, EMBASE and psycINFO (1990-2007), papers cited in publications retrieved, the worldwide web (using Google) and our personal collections of papers and books. Our aim was to identify papers enabling us to estimate the proportion of a country's suicides due to pesticide self-poisoning. Results. We conservatively estimate that there are 258,234 (plausible range 233,997 to 325,907) deaths from pesticide self-poisoning worldwide each year, accounting for 30\% (range 27\% to 37\%) of suicides globally. Official data from India probably underestimate the incidence of suicides; applying evidence-based corrections to India's official data, our estimate for world suicides using pesticides increases to 371,594 (range 347,357 to 439,267). The proportion of all suicides using pesticides varies from 4\% in the European Region to over 50\% in the Western Pacific Region but this proportion is not concordant with the volume of pesticides sold in each region; it is the pattern of pesticide use and the toxicity of the products, not the quantity used, that influences the likelihood they will be used in acts of fatal self-harm. Conclusion. Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for about one-third of the world's suicides. Epidemiological and toxicological data suggest that many of these deaths might be prevented if (a) the use of pesticides most toxic to humans was restricted, (b) pesticides could be safely stored in rural communities, and (c) the accessibility and quality of care for poisoning could be improved. {\copyright} 2007 Gunnell et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

RECENT FINDINGS: Foreign body  ingestion (FBI) is a problem that is frequently encountered by pediatric  providers. As new toys and products enter the marketplace, there may also be new  dangers from those objects not initially recognized. Some of the recent trends  and findings in pediatric FBI include an increase in adolescent injury from  ingestion of laundry detergent pods because of a popular game where participants  are encouraged to bite or swallow the pods, and injuries associated with  ingesting parts of a popular toy known as a 'Fidget Spinner'. SUMMARY: Adverse  events resulting from FBI range the entire gamut from nonexistent or minor  symptoms to moderate injury and rarely may be fatal. Factors such as age, type of  object ingested, anatomic location of the foreign body, and timing from ingestion  to receipt of medical attention all determine the risk posed to the child and  guide management decisions. Because of the constant development of products, and  the potential for the emergence of new and dangerous trends among children,  continued surveillance by the medical community is important in monitoring and  managing injuries associated with FBI.},

In  this paper we describe a rare case of self-inflicted penetrating head trauma by  electric drill. We document neuroimaging studies and review the management  concerning this pathology. To our knowledge, this is the first case of  intracranial retained drill bit with such radiological findings reported in the  literature. An 80-year-old male with no previous psychiatric disorder presented  at our hospital after suffering an accident while working with an electric drill.  Physical examination revealed right lower extremity plegia and three penetrating  scalp wounds to the left parasagittal region. Skull X-ray and computed tomography  demonstrated an intracranial metallic foreign body located in the left parietal  lobe and an intraparenchymal hematoma with no mass effect close to the foreign  body. The patient was taken to the operating room to remove the drill bit  fragment. Antibiotic and antiseizure prophylaxis were administered. Postoperative  computed tomography confirmed no residual metallic fragments and functional  recovery was excellent. After psychiatric assessment, suicide attempt was  confirmed and antidepressive therapy was then started. On follow-up, no  complication was documented. It is essential to exclude penetrating brain trauma  whenever a scalp wound is noticed in order to provide proper treatment and  prevention care. The permanent neurological deficit in low velocity injuries is  related to the degree and location of the primary injury. It also depends on an  early diagnosis and treatment and the absence of delayed complications.},

  abstract = {Objective To evaluate the association between epinephrine use before hospital arrival and short- and long-term mortality in patients with cardiac arrest. Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective, nonrandomized, observational propensity analysis of data from 417 188 OHCAs occurring in 2005-2008 in Japan in which patients aged 18 years or older had an OHCA before arrival of emergency medical service (EMS) personnel, were treated by EMS personnel, and were transported to the hospital. Main Outcome Measures Return of spontaneous circulation before hospital arrival, survival at 1 month after cardiac arrest, survival with good or moderate cerebral performance (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] 1 or 2), and survival with no, mild, or moderate neurological disability (Overall Performance Category [OPC] 1 or 2). Results Return of spontaneous circulation before hospital arrival was observed in 2786 of 15 030 patients (18.5\%) in the epinephrine group and 23 042 of 402 158 patients (5.7\%) in the no-epinephrine group (PϽ.001); it was observed in 2446 (18.3\%) and 1400 (10.5\%) of 13 401 propensity-matched patients, respectively (PϽ.001). In the total sample, the numbers of patients with 1-month survival and survival with CPC 1 or 2 and OPC 1 or 2, respectively, were 805 (5.4\%), 205 (1.4\%), and 211 (1.4\%) with epinephrine and 18 906 (4.7\%), 8903 (2.2\%), and 8831 (2.2\%) without epinephrine (all PϽ.001). Corresponding numbers in propensity-matched patients were 687 (5.1\%), 173 (1.3\%), and 178 (1.3\%) with epinephrine and 944 (7.0\%), 413 (3.1\%), and 410 (3.1\%) without epinephrine (all PϽ.001). In all patients, a positive association was observed between prehospital epinephrine and return of spontaneous circulation before hospital arrival (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.36; 95\% CI, 2.22-2.50; PϽ.001). In propensity-matched patients, a positive association was also observed (adjusted OR, 2.51; 95\% CI, 2.24-2.80; PϽ.001). In contrast, among all patients, negative associations were observed between prehospital epinephrine and long-term outcome measures (adjusted ORs: 1-month survival, 0.46 [95\% CI, 0.42-0.51]; CPC 1-2, 0.31 [95\% CI, 0.26-0.36]; and OPC 1-2, 0.32 [95\% CI, 0.270.38]; all PϽ.001). Similar negative associations were observed among propensitymatched patients (adjusted ORs: 1-month survival, 0.54 [95\% CI, 0.43-0.68]; CPC 1-2, 0.21 [95\% CI, 0.10-0.44]; and OPC 1-2, 0.23 [95\% CI, 0.11-0.45]; all PϽ.001). Conclusion Among patients with OHCA in Japan, use of prehospital epinephrine was significantly associated with increased chance of return of spontaneous circulation before hospital arrival but decreased chance of survival and good functional outcomes 1 month after the event.},

Design, Setting, and Patients Multicenter, randomized trial of patients experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United States and Canada. The a priori primary population was patients with cardiac arrest that was presumed to be of cardiac origin and that had occurred prior to the arrival of EMS personnel. Initial study enrollment varied by site, ranging from late July to mid November 2004; all sites halted study enrollment on March 31, 2005. Intervention Standard EMS care for cardiac arrest with an LDB-CPR device (n=554) or manual CPR (n=517). Main Outcome Measures The primary end point was survival to 4 hours after the 911 call. Secondary end points were survival to hospital discharge and neurological status among survivors. Results Following the first planned interim monitoring conducted by an independent data and safety monitoring board, study enrollment was terminated. No difference existed in the primary end point of survival to 4 hours between the manual CPR group and the LDB-CPR group overall (N=1071; 29.5\% vs 28.5\%; P=.74) or among the primary study population (n=767; 24.7\% vs 26.4\%, respectively; P=.62). However, among the primary population, survival to hospital discharge was 9.9\% in the manual CPR group and 5.8\% in the LDB-CPR group (P=.06, adjusted for covariates and clustering). A cerebral performance category of 1 or 2 at hospital discharge was recorded in 7.5\% of patients in the manual CPR group and in 3.1\% of the LDB-CPR group (P=.006). Conclusions Use of an automated LDB-CPR device as implemented in this study was associated with worse neurological outcomes and a trend toward worse survival than manual CPR. Device design or implementation strategies require further evaluation.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} The initial management of a trauma patient is a critical and demanding period. The use of extended focused assessment sonography for trauma (eFAST) has become more prevalent in trauma rooms, raising questions about the real ``added value'' of chest X-rays (CXRs) and pelvic X-rays (PXR), particularly in haemodynamically stable trauma patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a management protocol integrating eFAST and excluding X-rays in stable trauma patients. Methods:{\enspace} This was a prospective, interventional, single-centre study including all primary blunt trauma patients admitted to the trauma bay with a suspicion of severe trauma. All patients underwent physical examination and eFAST (assessing abdomen, pelvis, pericardium and pleura) before a whole-body CT scan (WBCT). Patients fulfilling all stability criteria at any time in transit from the scene of the accident to the hospital were managed in the trauma bay without chest and PXR. Results:{\enspace} Amongst 430 patients, 148 fulfilled the stability criteria (stability criteria group) of which 122 (82 \%) had no X-rays in the trauma bay. No diagnostic failure with an immediate clinical impact was identified in the stability criteria group (SC group). All cases of pneumothorax requiring chest drainage were identified by eFAST associated with a clinical examination before the WBCT scan in the SC group. The time spent in the trauma bay was significantly shorter for the SC group without X-rays compared to those who received any X-ray (25 [20; 35] vs. 38 [30; 60] min, respectively; p {$<$} 0.0001). An analysis of the cost and radiation exposure showed savings of 7000 {\cyrchar\CYRIE} and 100 mSv, respectively. Conclusions:{\enspace} No unrecognized diagnostic with a clinical impact due to the lack of CXR and PXR during the initial management of stable trauma patients was observed. The eFAST associated with physical examination provided the information necessary to safely complete the WBCT scan. It allowed a sensible cost and radiation saving.},

All received norepinephrine early because of life-threatening hypotension and the need to achieve a sufficient perfusion pressure rapidly and to maintain adequate flow. We analyzed the changes in transpulmonary thermodilution variables associated with the increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) induced by norepinephrine when the achieved MAP was {$\geq$}65 mm Hg. Results: Norepinephrine significantly increased MAP from 54 {\textpm} 8 to 76 {\textpm} 9 mm Hg, cardiac index (CI) from 3.2 {\textpm} 1.0 to 3.6 {\textpm} 1.1 L/min/m2, stroke volume index (SVI) from 34 {\textpm} 12 to 39 {\textpm} 13 ml/m2, global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI) from 694 {\textpm} 148 to 742 {\textpm} 168 ml/m2, and cardiac function index (CFI) from 4.7 {\textpm} 1.5 to 5.0 {\textpm} 1.6 per min. Beneficial hemodynamic effects on CI, SVI, GEDVI, and CFI were observed in the group of 71 patients with a baseline echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) {$>$}45\%, as well as in the group of 34 patients with a baseline LVEF {$\leq$}45\%. No change in CI, SVI, GEDVI, or CFI was observed in the 17 patients with baseline LVEF {$\leq$}45\% for whom values of MAP {$\geq$}75 mm Hg were achieved with norepinephrine. Conclusions: Early administration of norepinephrine aimed at rapidly achieving a sufficient perfusion pressure in severely hypotensive septic-shock patients is able to increase cardiac output through an increase in cardiac preload and cardiac contractility. This effect remained in patients with poor cardiac contractility except when values of MAP {$\geq$}75 mm Hg were achieved.},

  abstract = {Background: This porcine study was designed to explore the effects of repetitive intravenous adrenaline doses on physiologic parameters during CPR. Methods: Thirty-six adult pigs were randomised to four injections of: adrenaline 0.02 mg (kg dose)-1, adrenaline 0.03 mg (kg dose)-1 or saline control. The effect on systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure (CePP), end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), arterial oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry (SpO2), cerebral tissue oximetry (SctO2), were analysed immediately prior to each injection and at peak arterial systolic pressure and arterial blood gases were analysed at baseline and after 15 min. Result: In the group given 0.02 mg (kg dose)-1, there were increases in all arterial blood pressures at all 4 pressure peaks but CePP only increased significantly after peak 1. A decrease in ETCO2 following peak 1 and 2 was observed. SctO2 and SpO2 were lowered following injection 2 and beyond. In the group given a 0.03 mg (kg dose)-1, all ABP's increased at the first 4 pressure peaks but CePP only following 3 pressure peaks. Lower ETCO2, SctO2 and SpO2 were seen at peak 1 and beyond. In the two adrenaline groups, pH and Base Excess were lower and lactate levels higher compared to baseline as well as compared to the control. Conclusion: Repetitive intravenous adrenaline doses increased ABP's and to some extent also CePP, but significantly decreased organ and brain perfusion.

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Impaction of a soft food bolus in the oesophagus causes dysphagia and regurgitation. If the bolus does not pass spontaneously, then the patient is at risk of aspiration, dehydration, perforation, and death. Definitive management is with endoscopic intervention, recommended within 24 hours. Prior to endoscopy, many patients undergo a period of observation, awaiting spontaneous disimpaction, or may undergo enteral or parenteral treatments to attempt to dislodge the bolus. There is little consensus as to which of these conservative strategies is safe and effective to be used in this initial period, before resorting to definitive endoscopic management for persistent impaction. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of non-endoscopic conservative treatments in the management of soft food boluses impacted within the oesophagus. Search methods We searched the following databases, using relevant search terms: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL. The date of the search was 18 August 2019. We screened the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews on the topic to identify any additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of the management of acute oesophageal soft food bolus impaction, in adults and children, reporting the incidence of disimpaction (confirmed radiologically or clinically by return to oral diet) without the need for endoscopic intervention. We did not include studies focusing on sharp or solid object impaction. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Main results We identified 890 unique records through the electronic searches. We excluded 809 clearly irrelevant records and retrieved 81 records for further assessment. We subsequently included one randomised controlled trial that met the eligibility criteria, which was conducted in four Swedish centres and randomised 43 participants to receive either intravenous diazepam followed by glucagon, or intravenous placebos. The effect of the active substances compared with placebo on rates of disimpaction without intervention is uncertain, as the numbers from this single study were small, and the rates were similar (38\% versus 32\%; risk ratio 1.19, 95\% confidence interval 0.51 to 2.75, P = 0.69). The certainty of the evidence using GRADE for this outcome is low. Data on adverse events were lacking. Authors' conclusions There is currently inadequate data to recommend the use of any enteral or parenteral treatments in the management of acute oesophageal soft food bolus impaction. There is also inadequate data regarding potential adverse events from the use of these treatments, or from potential delays in definitive endoscopic management. Caution should be exercised when using any conservative management strategies in these patients. Plain language summary Use of treatments to dislodge soft foods stuck between the throat and the stomach to try to avoid the need for an endoscopy Review question Can a period of observation, treatment with swallowed substances, or treatment with substances given via the blood help to dislodge soft foods that are stuck between the throat and the stomach in order to avoid the need for an endoscopic procedure to clear it? Background Food can sometimes get stuck in the oesophagus, the pipe connecting the throat to the stomach that passes through the chest. This food often dislodges on its own, without any medical help, but occasionally a doctor's help is needed to clear it. Removing or dislodging these lumps of food can be done using a flexible camera or a rigid instrument, called an endoscope, but endoscopic procedures can have serious complications, like causing holes in the oesophagus. However, waiting for too long for the food to clear on its own can also increase the risk of a hole in the oesophagus and may lead to saliva or food falling into the lungs, causing serious infections. A variety of treatments are currently used to try to clear the food, without having to resort to an endoscopy, many of which also have potential side effects, including difficulty breathing, increased blood sugar levels, low blood pressure, and irregular heartbeat. We wanted to know if any of these treatments were better than simply waiting for the food to clear on its own, before trying to dislodge it with instruments. Study characteristics The evidence is current to August 2019. We found one trial suitable to answer our question, which compared giving a patient two drugs into a vein in (diazepam and glucagon) to placebos (clear liquids which appeared similar to the drugs but have no effect on the body). We did not look at treating sharp or hard objects, as these are treated differently. Key results There was not enough evidence to say with certainty which treatments for food impacted in the oesophagus are safe or effective. Quality of the evidence We graded the overall certainty of the evidence as low. More studies with more participants are needed to be able to answer the review question.},

  abstract = {Most foreign bodies ingested pass uneventfully through the GI tract, yet certain objects pose a greater risk. We describe a swallowed cigarette lighter causing a gastric ulcer which was successfully removed with a polypectomy snare. This is the first case of its kind to be reported in the US to our knowledge. 49 year old male with a history of schizophrenia and foreign body ingestion (FBI) presented complaining of epigastric pain, associated with vomiting. Exam was unremarkable. Plain abdominal radiographs demonstrated a foreign body resembling a cigarette lighter visualized within the stomach. Emergent EGD showed congestion and friability in the gastric mucosa with a 5mm non-bleeding cratered ulcer in the incisura. A cigarette lighter was found in the gastric fundus and successfully removed endoscopically with polypectomy snare. He was treated with pantoprazole and was scheduled for a follow up endoscopy. FBI occurs commonly, the of which result in benign passage. Endoscopic removal is necessary in 20\% of cases, however two recent studies have shown a much higher rate of intervention in the setting of intentional ingestion. Adults with psychiatric disorders, intoxication and incarcerated individuals present more frequently with FBI. The incidence of lighter ingestion is not well reported. Patients may identify and localize the discomfort however often it may not correlate with the site of impaction. With FBI the patient may be asymptomatic, have vomiting, drooling, wheezing or respiratory distress. It is imperative to evaluate for peritonitis and small bowel obstruction. Diagnosis can be made by X-rays, non-contrast CT scan or direct endoscopy. Recommendations for emergent endoscopic intervention include complete obstruction, batteries and sharp objects but do not comment on cigarette lighters. Harmful substances contained in lighter fluid include benzene and propane. The chemical properties of the individual hydrocarbon determine the specific toxicity, while the dose and route of ingestion affect which organs are exposed to the toxicity. In our case the material lead to direct destruction of the mucosa. Complications from this direct damage may have included perforation, abscess formation, internal fistula and hemorrhage. In conclusion, immediate removal of cigarette lighters and all other foreign bodies containing hazardous material regardless of size and shape should be done. (Figure Presented).},

Traditionally, SBP {$<$} 90 mmHg has represented the threshold for hypotension, but recent studies have suggested redefining hypotension as SBP {$<$} 110 mmHg. This study aims to examine the association of SBP with mortality in blunt trauma patients. Methods: This is an analysis of prospectively recorded data from adult ({$\geq$}16 years) blunt trauma patients. Included patients presented to hospitals belonging to the Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) between 2000 and 2009. The primary outcome was the association of SBP and mortality rates at 30 days. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to adjust for the influence of age, gender, Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) on mortality. Results: 47,927 eligible patients presented to TARN hospitals during the study period. Sample demographics were: median age: 51.1 years (IQR = 32.8--67.4); male 60\% (n = 28,694); median ISS 9 (IQR = 8--10); median GCS 15 (IQR = 15--15); and median SBP 135 mmHg (IQR = 120--152). We identified SBP {$<$} 110 mmHg as a cut off for hypotension, where a significant increase in mortality was observed. Mortality rates doubled at {$<$}100 mmHg, tripled at {$<$}90 mmHg and were 5- to 6-fold at {$<$}70 mmHg, irrespective of age. Conclusion: We recommend triaging adult blunt trauma patients with a SBP {$<$} 110 mmHg to resuscitation areas within dedicated trauma units for close monitoring and appropriate management. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Three million people in Sweden are trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Whether this training increases the frequency of bystander CPR or the survival rate among persons who have out-of-hospital cardiac arrests has been questioned. METHODS We analyzed a total of 30,381 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests witnessed in Sweden from January 1, 1990, through December 31, 2011, to determine whether CPR was performed before the arrival of emergency medical services (EMS) and whether early CPR was correlated with survival. RESULTS CPR was performed before the arrival of EMS in 15,512 cases (51.1\%) and was not performed before the arrival of EMS in 14,869 cases (48.9\%). The 30-day survival rate was 10.5\% when CPR was performed before EMS arrival versus 4.0\% when CPR was not performed before EMS arrival (P{$<$}0.001). When adjustment was made for a propensity score (which included the variables of age, sex, location of cardiac arrest, cause of cardiac arrest, initial cardiac rhythm, EMS response time, time from collapse to call for EMS, and year of event), CPR before the arrival of EMS was associated with an increased 30-day survival rate (odds ratio, 2.15; 95\% confidence interval, 1.88 to 2.45). When the time to defibrillation in patients who were found to be in ventricular fibrillation was included in the propensity score, the results were similar. The positive correlation between early CPR and survival rate remained stable over the course of the study period. An association was also observed between the time from collapse to the start of CPR and the 30-day survival rate. From the Center for Resuscitation Science, Solna (I.H.-A., G.R., J.

Physician reports of treatment plans, presumed causes of observed vital sign abnormalities, and degree of certainty were compared before and after knowledge of point-of-care ultrasonographic findings. The clinical utility of point-of-care ultrasonographic data was also evaluated. Results: Seventy-four adult sepsis patients were enrolled: 27 (37\%) sepsis, 30 (40\%) severe sepsis, 16 (22\%) septic shock, and 1 (1\%) systemic inflammatory response syndrome. After receipt of point-of-care ultrasonographic data, physicians altered the presumed primary cause of vital sign abnormalities in 12 cases (17\% [95\% confidence interval \{CI\} 8\% to 25\%]) and procedural intervention plans in 20 cases (27\% [95\% CI 17\% to 37\%]). Overall treatment plans were changed in 39 cases (53\% [95\% CI 41\% to 64\%]). Certainty increased in 47 (71\%) cases and decreased in 19 (29\%). Measured on a 100-mm visual analog scale, the mean clinical utility score was 65 mm (SD 29; 95\% CI 58 to 72), with usefulness reported in all cases. Conclusion: Emergency physicians found point-of-care ultrasonographic data about cardiac contractility, inferior vena cava diameter, and inferior vena cava collapsibility to be clinically useful in treating adult patients with sepsis. Increased certainty followed acquisition of point-of-care ultrasonographic data in most instances.

The head injury can be described as minimal, minor, moderate, or severe, based on symptoms after the injury. Patients with minimal ◊ head injury are those with trauma to the head and no loss of consciousness, a normal GCS, and no symptoms of head injury. Minor head injury patients have a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 to 15 after head injury.[1] Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a non-specific term describing blunt, penetrating, or blast injuries to the brain. TBI can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe, typically based on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and/or neurobehavioural deficits after the injury. In mild TBI, patients have a GCS of 15 and no neurological deficits. The term 'concussion' has been used interchangeably with mild TBI and minimal or minor head injury; a consensus has not been attained regarding the definition.[2] Both the CDC and WHO agree that mild TBI is due to a blunt or mechanical force that results in some type of transient confusion, disorientation or loss of consciousness lasting not more than 30 minutes, and possibly associated with transient neurobehavioral deficits and a GCS no worse than 13-15.[3] [CDC: heads up]},

Methods Data were collected on the adequacy of views obtained and timing of the scan, as well as the clinical findings of pericardial effusion and ventricular wall motion. Any intervention performed as a result of the scan was also noted. ELS was performed on 50 patients during cardiac arrest. Results Adequate views were obtained in 47 (94\%) scans, and 45 (90\%) were obtained within the 10 s rhythm check. Twenty patients (40\%) had ventricular wall motion (VWM), three (6\%) had pericardial effusions and six patients (12\%) had an intervention performed as a direct result of the scan. These included pericardiocentesis, thrombolysis and insertion of a chest drain. The presence of VWM had a positive predictive value of 55\%. The absence of VWM resulted in a negative predictive value of 97\% for predicting return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Conclusion It is concluded that ELS is feasible and that the scan findings may guide further interventions.},

  abstract = {Background To determine whether a restrictive strategy of red-cell transfusion and a liberal strategy produced equivalent results in critically ill patients, we compared the rates of death from all causes at 30 days and the severity of organ dysfunction. Methods We enrolled 838 critically ill patients with euvolemia after initial treatment who had hemoglobin concentrations of less than 9.0 g per deciliter within 72 hours after admission to the intensive care unit and randomly assigned 418 patients to a restrictive strategy of transfusion, in which red cells were transfused if the hemoglobin concentration dropped below 7.0 g per deciliter and hemoglobin concentrations were maintained at 7.0 to 9.0 g per deciliter, and 420 patients to a liberal strategy, in which transfusions were given when the hemoglobin concentration fell below 10.0 g per deciliter and hemoglobin concentrations were maintained at 10.0 to 12.0 g per deciliter. Results Overall, 30-day mortality was similar in the two groups (18.7 percent vs. 23.3 percent, P= 0.11). However, the rates were significantly lower with the restrictive transfusion strategy among patients who were less acutely ill --- those with an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of <<20 (8.7 percent in the restrictive-strategy group and 16.1 percent in the liberal-strategy group, P=0.03) --- and among patients who were less than 55 years of age (5.7 percent and 13.0 percent, respectively; P=0.02), but not among patients with clinically significant cardiac disease (20.5 percent and 22.9 percent, respectively; P=0.69). The mortality rate during hospitalization was significantly lower in the restrictive-strategy group (22.2 percent vs. 28.1 percent, P=0.05). Conclusions A restrictive strategy of red-cell transfusion is at least as effective as and possibly superior to a liberal transfusion strategy in critically ill patients, with the possible exception of patients with acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina.

  abstract = {Background: Systematic research into self-harm in the Australian asylum seeker population is scarce, largely due to the lack of accessible data. The aim of this study was to examine the incidence and characteristics of self-harm across the Australian asylum seeker population, and to ascertain whether self-harm rates and characteristics vary by processing arrangements (i.e. community-based arrangements, community detention, onshore detention, offshore detention (Nauru), and offshore detention (Manus Island)), and gender. Methods: Data relating to the incidence of self-harm, method(s) used to self-harm, processing arrangements, and gender were extracted from all self-harm incidents recorded as occurring among the Australian asylum seeker population between 1st August 2014 and 31st July 2015. Self-harm episode rates were calculated using the average estimated adult population figures for the 12-month period for each asylum seeker population. Results: 949 self-harm episodes were included in the analyses. Rates ranged from 5 per 1000 asylum seekers in community-based arrangements to 260 per 1000 asylum seekers in offshore detention in Nauru. Rates were highest among asylum seekers in offshore and onshore detention facilities, and lowest among asylum seekers in community-based arrangements and community detention. The most common methods of self-harm were cutting (37\%), self-battery (26\%), and attempted hanging (11\%), with asylum seekers in held detention using a wider variety of methods than those in community-based arrangements and community detention. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the exceptionally high rates of self-harm among detained asylum seekers compared to rates observed in the general Australian population, and among asylum seekers in communitybased settings. These findings point clearly to the deleterious impact of immigration detention, and warrant urgent attention.},

  abstract = {Introduction Asylum seekers and refugees are at an elevated risk of self-harm, with younger age and traumatic experiences found to further increase such risk. Despite this, evidence regarding self-harm among unaccompanied asylum seekers and refugee minors has not been synthesised. As self-harm among minors is a risk factor for a range of adverse clinical and social outcomes, including suicide, such information may help to inform evidence-based prevention strategies among these vulnerable populations. This systematic review will synthesise findings from the literature regarding the prevalence, methods and characteristics of self-harm, including risk and protective factors, among unaccompanied asylum seekers and refugee minors internationally. Methods and analysis We searched key electronic databases (PsycINFO, Scopus, PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE) and grey literature for relevant studies published in English from database inception to 10 February 2023. Our primary outcome is self-harm among unaccompanied asylum seekers and/or refugee minors. With the exception of single-case studies, clinical trials and case-control studies, we will include all types of study design that examine the prevalence of self-harm in unaccompanied asylum seekers and/or refugee minors. We will exclude dissertations, conference abstracts, letters, book chapters, editorials, study registrations, registered protocols and qualitative studies. Only studies reporting on participants aged {$<$}18 years will be eligible for inclusion. The Methodological Standard for Epidemiological Research Scale will be used to assess the quality of included studies. If there are sufficient studies and homogeneity between them, we will conduct meta-analyses to calculate pooled estimates of self-harm rates, as well as comparisons between subgroups of relevance. If the studies do not report sufficient data, or there is substantial heterogeneity, we will provide a narrative synthesis of the findings. Ethics and dissemination This review is exempt from ethics approval. Our findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

  abstract = {Objective: Arterial hypotension is a recognized complication of emergency intubation, but the consequence of this event is poorly described. Our aim was to identify the incidence of postintubation hypotension (PIH) after emergency intubation and to determine its association with inhospital mortality. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of tracheal intubations performed in a large, urban emergency department over a 1-year period. Patients were included if they were older than 17 years and had no systolic blood pressure measurements less than 90 mm Hg for 30 consecutive minutes before intubation. Patients were analyzed in 2 groups, those with PIH, defined as any recorded systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg within 60 minutes of intubation, and those with no PIH. The primary outcome was inhospital mortality. Results: Of 465 patients who underwent emergency intubation, 336 met inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Postintubation hypotension occurred in 79 (23\%) of 336 patients. Patients with PIH had significantly higher inhospital mortality (33\% vs 21\%; 95\% confidence interval for 12\% difference, 1\%23\%) and longer mean intensive care length of stay (LOS) (9.7 vs 5.9 days, P b .01) and hospital LOS (17.0 vs 11.4 days, P b .01). Postintubation hypotension remained a significant predictor of inhospital mortality after adjusting for confounding using multivariable logistic regression analysis (odds ratio, 1.9; 95\% confidence interval, 1.1-3.5). Conclusion: Postintubation hypotension occurs in almost one quarter of normotensive patients undergoing emergency intubation. Postintubation hypotension is independently associated with higher inhospital mortality and longer intensive care unit and hospital LOS.},

Thus, concerns have been expressed in regard to the ability of Guyton's simplistic model, with few parameters, to model the complex human circulation. Further concerns have been raised in regard to the artificial experimental preparations that Guyton used. Recently reported measurements in humans support Guyton's theoretical and animal work.},

Terrorist organizations have threatened to attack the USA and international food and water supplies.

There are no FDA-approved therapies tested for oral cyanide ingestions and no approved intramuscular or oral therapies, which would be valuable in mass casualty settings. The aim of this review is to evaluate the risks of oral cyanide and its unique toxicokinetics, as well as address the lack of available rapid diagnostics and treatments for mass casualty events. We will also review current strategies for developing new therapies. A review of the literature using the~PRISMA checklist detected 7284 articles, screened 1091, and included 59 articles or other reports. Articles referenced in this review were specific to risk, clinical presentation, diagnostics, current treatments, and developing therapies. Current diagnostics of cyanide exposure can take hours or days, which can delay treatment. Moreover, current therapies for cyanide poisoning are administered intravenously and are not specifically tested for oral exposures, which can result in higher cyanide doses and unique toxicodynamics. New therapies developed for oral cyanide exposures that are easily delivered, safe, and can be administered quickly by first responders in a mass casualty event are needed. Current research is aimed at identifying an antidote that is safe, effective, easy to administer, and has a rapid onset of action.},

Clinical symptoms of such  behaviour can be the self-induced incorporation of foreign bodies. In the head  and neck area, this form of autoaggressivity causes primary or secondary  infectious complications with different clinical manifestations. Below follows a  description of diagnosis, therapy and follow-up of such a case, comparing our own  findings with the corresponding literature. CASE REPORT: A 24-year-old woman with  manifest borderline personality disorder was referred to the Department of  Maxillofacial Surgery after developing a swelling in the infra-auricular region.  After antibiotic therapy failed to reduce inflammatory symptoms, local revision  was performed including excision of two metallic foreign bodies. Comprehensive  radiological evaluation identified multiple foreign bodies in the head and neck  region and lower arms. A total of 76 metallic foreign bodies was removed  surgically. During early surgical follow-up and subsequent psychiatric treatment,  the patient incorporated new foreign bodies. DISCUSSION: The case reported  represents a pattern of foreign body incorporation which is unusual based on  review of the literature but characteristic for patients with borderline  personality disorder. Diagnostics and therapy require an individual concept which  only can be implemented in close co-operation with psychiatrists. Secondary  clinical benefit derived from surgical diagnostics and therapy as well as the  possibility of autoaggressive relapse have to be taken into consideration.},

However, as current definitions do not include hyperlactatemia as a mandatory criterion, some hypotensive patients may be diagnosed as having septic shock despite exhibiting normolactatemia. The significance of persistent sepsis-induced hypotension without hyperlactatemia is unclear. Is it really septic shock? Our aim was to determine differences in outcome between patients diagnosed as having septic shock but exhibiting normal vs elevated lactate levels during evolution. We also explored the potential implications of including hyperlactatemia as an obligatory diagnostic criterion. Methods: We performed retrospective analyses on a cohort of 302 septic shock patients. Results: When we divided patients according to the presence of hyperlactatemia, 34\% evolved without hyperlactatemia and exhibited a very low mortality risk (7.7\% compared with 42.9\% of those with hyperlactatemia). These patients also presented less severe organ dysfunctions and higher central venous O2 saturation values, and required lower norepinephrine doses. The potential inclusion of hyperlactatemia in septic shock definition would reduce incidence in 34\% but increase absolute mortality risk in 11\%. Conclusions: Persistent sepsis-induced hypotension without hyperlactatemia may not constitute a real septic shock. Our results support the need to review the current definition of septic shock. Hyperlactatemia could represent an objective parameter worth to be explored as a potential diagnostic criterion for septic shock.},

  abstract = {Compensatory reserve was measured in baboons ( n = 13) during hemorrhage (Hem) and lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) using a machine-learning algorithm developed to estimate compensatory reserve by detecting reductions in central blood volume during LBNP. The algorithm calculates compensatory reserve index (CRI) from normovolemia (CRI = 1) to cardiovascular decompensation (CRI = 0). The hypothesis was that Hem and LBNP will elicit similar CRI values and that CRI would have higher specificity than stroke volume (SV) in predicting decompensation. Blood was removed in four steps: 6.25\%, 12.5\%, 18.75\%, and 25\% of total blood volume. Four weeks after Hem, the same animals were subjected to four levels of LBNP that was matched on the basis of their central venous pressure. Data (mean {\textpm} 95\% confidence interval) indicate that CRI decreased ( P {$<$} 0.001) from baseline during Hem (0.69 {\textpm} 0.10, 0.57 {\textpm} 0.09, 0.36 {\textpm} 0.10, 0.16 {\textpm} 0.08, and 0.08 {\textpm} 0.03) and LBNP (0.76 {\textpm} 0.05, 0.66 {\textpm} 0.08, 0.36 {\textpm} 0.13, 0.23 {\textpm} 0.11, and 0.14 {\textpm} 0.09). CRI was not different between Hem and LBNP ( P = 0.20). Linear regression analysis between Hem CRI and LBNP CRI revealed a slope of 1.03 and a correlation coefficient of 0.96. CRI exhibited greater specificity than SV in both Hem (92.3 vs. 82.1) and LBNP (94.8 vs. 83.1) and greater ROC AUC in Hem (0.94 vs. 0.84) and LBNP (0.94 vs. 0.92). These data support the hypothesis that Hem and LBNP elicited the same CRI response, suggesting that measurement of compensatory reserve is superior to SV as a predictor of cardiovascular decompensation},

The National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) is a very large, federally supported, multicenter, prospective study designed to define the sensitivity, for detecting significant cervical spine injury, of criteria previously shown to have high negative predictive value. Done at 23 different emergency departments across the United States and projected to enroll more than 20 times as many patients with cervical spine injury than any previous study, NEXUS should be able to answer definitively questions about the validity and reliability of clinical criteria used as a preliminary screen for cervical spine injury.},

The purpose of this retrospective case series was to describe the  ultrasonographic features, histopathological findings, and clinical presentation  in a group of cats with benign small intestinal stricture. Inclusion criteria  were cats presenting during the period 2010-2017, and that had ultrasonography  and small intestinal stricture confirmed at surgery. For each cat, clinical data  and ultrasonographic findings were retrieved from the medical record, and  histopathology, where available, was reviewed. Eight cats met the inclusion  criteria. The location of strictures was duodenum (1/8), mid- to distal jejunum  (4/8), and ileum (3/8). Ultrasonographic findings included gastric distension  (8/8) and generalized (3/8) or segmental (5/8) intestinal dilation consistent  with mechanical obstruction. Ingesta did not propagate beyond the strictured  segment. Wall thickening was mild to moderate (3-6~mm). Normal wall layering was  disrupted in all cats. Strictures were predominantly hypoechoic (7/8) and  associated with hyperechoic peri-intestinal mesentery (6/8). Annular strictures  (5/8) were less than 15~mm in length whereas long-segment strictures (3/8) were  greater than 15~mm in length. Histopathology showed transmural disease with  fibrosis and inflammation (8/8), often (6/8) extending into the bordering  mesentery. The mucosa was the most severely affected layer and epithelial injury  accompanied the mucosal fibrosis/inflammation. Clinical presentation reflected  delayed diagnosis of chronic bowel obstruction with debilitation (8/8), marked  weight loss (8/8), and prerenal azotemia (5/8). Benign fibrostenotic stricture  should be considered a differential diagnosis in debilitated young cats  presenting with chronic bowel disease and ultrasonographic features of intestinal  obstruction.},

The population included adults with cardiac arrest in any setting. Pairs of investigators reviewed studies for relevance, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for individual studies. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE for controlled trials and metaanalyses were performed when at least two studies could be pooled. Results: We included 15 controlled trials and 67 observational studies. The majority of studies included out-of-hospital cardiac arrest only. Metaanalyses were performed for two controlled trials comparing epinephrine to placebo, three comparing vasopressin to epinephrine, and three comparing epinephrine plus vasopressin to epinephrine only. All controlled trials ranged between low to some concern in risk of bias. The certainty of evidence ranged from very low to high. Risk of bias for observational studies was generally critical or serious, largely due to confounding and selection bias. Conclusions: Controlled trial data suggest that epinephrine improves return of spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital discharge, and 3-month survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The improvement in short-term outcomes appeared more pronounced for non-shockable rhythms.},

Information regarding psychiatric risk indicators was extracted from participants' psychiatric records. Generalized linear models with negative binomial distribution and log link function, as well as chi-square tests, were used to address study aims. Clients with a lifetime atypical/severe NSSI history met criteria for a significantly greater number of psychiatric risk indicators than clients with a lifetime history of common NSSI only; however, these clients were not significantly more likely to report recent suicidal actions. Individuals with an atypical/severe NSSI history may demonstrate more severe psychopathology than those with a history of common NSSI only. Thus, it may be clinically useful to consider individuals with an atypical/severe NSSI history as a high-risk subgroup. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: The body packer swallows or embeds drugs in body cavities in a purposeful way. Packets usually contain of opium, cocaine, cannabis  and amphetamines. The significant complications of body packing usually are  symptoms of drug toxicity due to leaking or ruptured packets or symptoms of  ingesting relatively large foreign bodies. Herein, we present a case of heroin  body-packing that resulted in subsequent bowel obstruction. CASE PRESENTATION: A  30-year-old male, who was brought from the prison to the emergency department,  complained of abdominal pain. After the absence of intoxication symptoms and  insignificant plain abdominal radiograph results, abdominal computed tomography  (CT) scan revealed the presence of ingested packets in the stomach as well as in  the patient's small intestine. Therefore, the decision of surgery was immediately  made for the patient, and during the surgery, the drug packets were entirely  removed. The patient was discharged in good general condition three days after  his surgery. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Body packers are in considerable risk as  rupture of packet inside the body and risk of obstruction that both of them may  be fatal. Patients should be monitored for complications, possible early  treatment, and removal or assistance in expulsion drug packets from the body.  Initially on plain abdominal radiographs, classic findings suggest the presence  of drug packets. CONCLUSION: In case of an inconclusive plain abdominal  radiograph, further investigation with CT is indicated, with an almost 100~\%  sensitivity. For symptomatic patients, bowel obstruction and acute drug toxicity  are the two most common indications for surgical intervention.},

  abstract = {AIM: To investigate predictive risk factors associated with complications in the endoscopic removal of foreign bodies from the upper gastrointestinal tract.  METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 194 patients with a  diagnosis of foreign body impaction in the upper gastrointestinal tract,  confirmed by endoscopy, at two university hospital in South Korea. Patient  demographic data, including age, gender, intention to ingestion, symptoms at  admission, and comorbidities, were collected. Clinical features of the foreign  bodies, such as type, size, sharpness of edges, number, and location, were  analyzed. Endoscopic data those were analyzed included duration of foreign body  impaction, duration of endoscopic performance, endoscopic device, days of  hospitalization, complication rate, 30-d mortality rate, and the number of  operations related to foreign body removal. RESULTS: The types of upper  gastrointestinal foreign bodies included fish bones, drugs, shells, meat, metal,  and animal bones. The locations of impacted foreign bodies were the upper  esophagus (57.2\%), mid esophagus (28.4\%), stomach (10.8\%), and lower esophagus  (3.6\%). The median size of the foreign bodies was 26.2 {\textpm} 16.7 mm. Among 194  patients, endoscopic removal was achieved in 189, and complications developed in  51 patients (26.9\%). Significant complications associated with foreign body  impaction and removal included deep lacerations with minor bleeding (n = 31,  16\%), ulcer (n = 11, 5.7\%), perforation (n = 3, 1.5\%), and abscess (n = 1, 0.5\%).  Four patients underwent operations because of incomplete endoscopic foreign body  extraction. In multivariate analyses, risk factors for endoscopic complications  and failure were sharpness (HR = 2.48, 95\%CI: 1.07-5.72; P = 0.034) and a greater  than 12-h duration of impaction (HR = 2.42, 95\%CI: 1.12-5.25, P = 0.025).  CONCLUSION: In cases of longer than 12 h since foreign body ingestion or  sharp-pointed objects, rapid endoscopic intervention should be provided in  patients with ingested foreign bodies.},

  abstract = {Purpose The incidence of lithium button battery ingestion has been increasing recently, which results in severe complications. We aimed to demonstrate the association between the corrosion of lithium button batteries in the esophagus on radiographs and their complications. Methods The nine pediatric patients included in this study were classified into two groups based on the presence of severe complications. The presence and degree of corrosion on plain radiographs were evaluated. The degree of corrosion was classified into the following three grades; none: 0\%; moderate: 1-50\%; severe: 51-100\%. Fisher's exact test was used for statistical analyses. Results Of the nine patients, five showed complications. The number of patients who had grade none, moderate, and severe degrees of corrosion was three, four, and two, respectively. The incidence of severe complications differed significantly between the incidence of lithium button batteries' contour (without vs. with severe complications [presence/absence of corrosion] = 1/3 vs. 5/0, respectively; P = 0.0476). In cases with none degree of corrosion, all three cases had no complication, and in cases with a severe degree of corrosion, all two cases had complications. Conclusion The cases with the presence of corrosion of lithium button batteries had a higher tendency to have severe complications. Therefore, physicians should anticipate the presence of severe complications in pediatric patients with corrosion more than those without corrosion.},

Although a number of defects in the immune system have been identified in sepsis, few studies have examined the effect of sepsis on DCs, which is the purpose of this study. In addition, this study investigated the effect of sepsis on macrophages, which are reported to undergo apoptosis, and MHC II expression, which has been noted to be decreased in sepsis. Spleens from 26 septic patients and 20 trauma patients were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. Although sepsis did not decrease the number of macrophages, sepsis did cause a dramatic reduction in the percentage area of spleen occupied by FDCs, i.e., 2.9 {\textpm} 0.4 vs 0.7 {\textpm} 0.2\% in trauma and septic patients, respectively. The number of MHC II-expressing cells, including interdigitating DCs, was decreased in septic, compared with trauma, patients. However, sepsis did not appear to induce a loss of MHC II expression in those B cells, macrophages, or DCs that were still present. The dramatic loss of DCs in sepsis may significantly impair B and T cell function and contribute to the immune suppression that is a hallmark of the disorder.},

Recent work implicates lymphocyte apoptosis as a potential factor in the immunosuppression of sepsis. If lymphocyte apoptosis is an important mechanism, specific subsets of lymphocytes may be more vulnerable. A prospective study of lymphocyte cell typing and apoptosis was conducted in spleens from 27 patients with sepsis and 25 patients with trauma. Spleens from 16 critically ill nonseptic (3 prospective and 13 retrospective) patients were also evaluated. Immunohistochemical staining showed a caspase-9-mediated profound progressive loss of B and CD4 T helper cells in sepsis. Interestingly, sepsis did not decrease CD8 T or NK cells. Although there was no overall effect on lymphocytes from critically ill nonseptic patients (considered as a group), certain individual patients did exhibit significant loss of B and CD4 T cells. The loss of B and CD4 T cells in sepsis is especially significant because it occurs during life-threatening infection, a state in which massive lymphocyte clonal expansion should exist. Mitochondria-dependent lymphocyte apoptosis may contribute to the immunosuppression in sepsis by decreasing the number of immune effector cells. Similar loss of lymphocytes may be occurring in critically ill patients with other disorders.},

The purpose of this study is to describe the outcomes of patients with NER of EFI. A retrospective chart review from 2007 to 2017 was performed at a single tertiary care center. There were 593 patients who presented to the emergency department with EFI, defined as recent soft food ingestion and inability to tolerate oral secretions. Adequate follow-up was defined as a gastroenterology clinic visit or EGD within 6 months of EFI. Out of these, 149 patients (25.1\%) had NER of their EFI. Patients with NER were less likely to have adequate follow-up than those with ER (45.0\% vs. 59.5\%, P = 0.003). Of those without established esophageal disease and NER, 92.5\% had significant esophageal pathology on endoscopy, including stricture (34.0\%), features of eosinophilic esophagitis (30.2\%), and esophagitis (22.6\%). Recurrent EFI occurred at a similar rate between patients with NER and ER (9.4\% vs. 14.6\%, P = 0.14). Patients with established esophageal disease (odds ratio [OR]: 1.51, P = 0.04) and recommendation to follow-up at time of EFI (OR: 6.06, P {$<$} 0.001) were most likely to follow up after EFI. Approximately, a quarter of patients with EFI will experience NER of their EFI. Virtually, all patients (92.5\%) were found to have esophageal disease warranting longitudinal care. Importantly, follow-up rates are significantly lower in those with NER than their counterparts requiring EGD. Our study highlights the need to develop standardized protocols that improve follow-up for patients after NER of EFI.},

Although most cases have a clear history, foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract can be  an unexpected finding after operations for other conditions. This study compares  the clinical presentations and outcomes for patients requiring or not requiring  operations. Between January 1998 and December 2001, 80 patients with foreign body  ingestion were included and divided into two groups. Specifically, group 1  patients were managed nonoperatively, and group 2 patients were managed  operatively. The patient demographics, symptoms, foreign body ingestion  mechanisms, type of diagnostic studies and management, and outcomes were compared  between the two groups. Group 1 contained 44 patients, and group 2 contained 36  patients. Group 1 patients were significantly younger, but the incidence of  underlying disease and the proportion of patients who ingested foreign bodies  intentionally or incidentally was similar in groups 1 and 2. Most of the ingested  foreign bodies in group 1 were in the esophagus and stomach, but for group 2  patients they were mostly in the small bowel. Moreover, most of group 1 patients  were asymptomatic, which was not the case in group 2. Most group 2 patients had  no known history of foreign body ingestion, and diagnoses generally were  established during surgery. Neither group of patients displayed any mortality.  Nonoperative management of foreign body ingestion usually can succeed in  asymptomatic patients with a clear history; however, ingested foreign bodies can  cause serious problems for those patients without a clear history of foreign body  ingestion.},

We studied the poorly  understood group of patients who intentionally ingest FBs. METHODS: Cases of  intentional ingestion of FBs (n = 305) were identified, retrospectively, from an  electronic endoscopy database and followed. Cases occurred among 33 different  patients, who underwent endoscopy from October 1, 2001, to July 31, 2009 (39.0  cases/year); 79\% were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. Financial cost  analysis was performed using hospital billing and cost systems. RESULTS: Commonly  ingested FBs included pens (23.6\%), batteries (9.2\%), knives (7.2\%), and razor  blades (6.9\%). Most endoscopic procedures were performed under general  anesthesia. FBs were commonly retrieved by snares (58.0\%), rat-toothed forceps  (14.4\%), and nets (11.5\%), assisted sometimes by use of overtubes (10.8\%), and  hoods (4.6\%). FB extraction was unsuccessful at the initial endoscopy in only 20  cases; 2 cases eventually required surgical extraction. Minor complications  occurred in 11 endoscopies. There were no deaths or perforations. The total  estimated costs were \$2,018,073 (\$1,500,627 in hospital costs, \$240,640 in  physician fees, and \$276,806 for security services). Costs were significantly  higher for inpatients. Major payers were Medicare (48\%) and Medicaid (31\%).  CONCLUSIONS: Intentional FB ingestion occurs among a relatively small number of  patients with psychiatric disorders and is costly. Endoscopic retrieval is  relatively effective and safe, but often requires general anesthesia. These cases  utilize significant hospital and fiscal resources. Attention should be focused on  preventing these recurrent and costly episodes.},

  abstract = {There has been a rapid expansion in the knowledge of paediatric gastroenterology over the recent decade, with a fast-growing repertoire of diagnostic techniques  and management strategies for a wide spectrum of childhood gastrointestinal (GI)  diseases. Paediatric GI endoscopy is a core competency every paediatric  gastroenterologist should possess, and represents one of the most common  procedures performed in children for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.  Yet there remains a dearth of literature on the utility and outcomes of  paediatric GI endoscopy in the Asia-Pacific region. Data on the diagnostic value  of paediatric GI endoscopy would be an important aspect of discussion, with the  emergence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and eosinophilic GI disease as  increasingly common endoscopic diagnoses. Time-based trends in paediatric GI  endoscopy do point towards more IBD and gastroesophageal reflux disease-related  complications being diagnosed, with a declining incidence of GI bleeding.  However, the real-world diagnostic value of endoscopy in Asia must be  contextualised to the region-specific prevalence of paediatric GI diseases.  Helicobacter pylori infection, particularly that of multidrug-resistant strains,  remains a highly prevalent problem in specific regions. Paediatric functional GI  disorders still account for the majority of childhood GI complaints in most  centres, hence the diagnostic yield of endoscopy should be critically evaluated  in the absence of alarm symptoms. GI therapeutic endoscopy is also occasionally  required for children with ingested foreign bodies, intestinal polyposis or  oesophageal strictures requiring dilation. Endoscopic haemostasis is a  potentially life-saving skill in cases of massive GI bleeding typically from  varices or peptic ulcers. Advanced endoscopic techniques such as capsule  endoscopy and balloon-assisted enteroscopy have found traction, particularly in  East Asian centres, as invaluable diagnostic and therapeutic tools in the  management of IBD, obscure GI bleeding and intestinal polyposis. State of the art  endoscopic diagnostics and therapeutics, including the use of artificial  intelligence-aided endoscopy algorithms, real-time confocal laser endomicroscopy  and peroral endoscopic myotomy, are expected to gain more utility in paediatrics.  As paediatric gastroenterology matures as a subspecialty in Asia, it is essential  current paediatric endoscopists and future trainees adhere to minimum practice  standards, and keep abreast of the evolving trends in the diagnostic and  therapeutic value of endoscopy. This review discusses the available published  literature on the utility of paediatric GI endoscopy in Asia Pacific, with the  relevant clinical outcomes.},

The evidence for using these airway and ventilation strategies to manage a circulation problem is unclear. The potentially harmful effects of drug-assisted intubation and positive pressure ventilation include reduced cardiac output, apnea, hypoxia, hypocapnea (due to inadvertent hyperventilation), and unnecessarily prolonged on-scene times. Conversely, the beneficial effects of spontaneous negative pressure ventilation on cardiac output are well described. Few studies, however, have attempted to explore the potential advantages of a strategy of delayed intubation and ventilation (together with a policy of aggressive volume replacement) in shocked trauma patients. Given the lack of evidence, the decision making around how, when, and where to subject shocked trauma patients to intubation and positive pressure ventilation remains complex. If providers choose to delay intubation, they must have the appropriate skills to safely manage the airway and recognize the need for subsequent intervention. If they decide to perform intubation and positive pressure ventilation, they must understand the potential risks and how best to minimize them. We suggest that for patients with hemorrhagic shock who do not have a compromised airway and who are able to maintain adequate oxygen saturation (or mentation if monitoring is unreliable), a strategy of delayed intubation should be strongly encouraged.

  abstract = {Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often associated with uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock (UHS), which contributes significantly to the mortality of severe trauma. Studies have demonstrated that permissive hypotension resuscitation improves the survival for uncontrolled hemorrhage. What the ideal target mean arterial pressure (MAP) is for TBI with UHS remains unclear. Methods: With the rat model of TBI in combination with UHS, we investigated the effects of a series of target resuscitation pressures (MAP from 50e90 mm Hg) on animal survival, brain perfusion, and organ function before hemorrhage controlled. Results: Rats in 50-, 60-, and 70-mm Hg target MAP groups had less blood loss and less fluid requirement, a better vital organ including mitochondrial function and better cerebral blood flow, and animal survival (8, 6, and 7 of 10, respectively) than 80- and 90-mm Hg groups. The 70-mm Hg group had a better cerebral blood flow and cerebral mitochondrial function than in 50- and 60-mm Hg groups. In contrast, 80- and 90-mm Hg groups resulted in an excessive hemodilution, a decreased blood flow, an increased brain water content, and more severe cerebral edema. Conclusions: A 50-mm Hg target MAP is not suitable for the resuscitation of TBI combined with UHS. A 70 mm Hg of MAP is the ideal target resuscitation pressure for this trauma, which can keep sufficient perfusion to the brain and keep good organ function including cerebral mitochondrial function.},

Resuscitations were recorded using video equipment in designated resuscitation rooms, and the use of POCUS was documented and timed. A linear mixed-effects model was used to estimate the effect of POCUS on pulse check duration. Results: Twenty-three patients were enrolled in our study. The mean duration of pulse checks with POCUS was 21.0 s (95\% CI, 18--24) compared with 13.0 s (95\% CI, 12--15) for those without POCUS. POCUS increased the duration of pulse checks and CPR interruption by 8.4 s (95\% CI, 6.7--10.0 [p {$<$} 0.0001]). Age, body mass index (BMI), and procedures did not significantly affect the duration of pulse checks. Conclusions: The use of POCUS during cardiac arrest resuscitation was associated with significantly increased duration of pulse checks, nearly doubling the 10-s maximum duration recommended in current guidelines. It is important for acute care providers to pay close attention to the duration of interruptions in the delivery of chest compressions when using POCUS during cardiac arrest resuscitation.},

This event highlighted a gap in the knowledge of most clinicians in the UK. In response, this special article aims to enlighten and signpost anaesthetists and intensivists towards the general management of OP nerve agent poisoned patients. Drawing on a broad range of sources, we will discuss what OP nerve agents are, how they work, and how to recognise and treat OP nerve agent poisoning. OP nerve agents primarily act by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, causing an acute cholinergic crisis; death usually occurs through respiratory failure. The antimuscarinic agent atropine, oximes (to reactivate acetylcholinesterase), neuroprotective drugs, and critical care remain the mainstays of treatment. The risk to medical staff from OP poisoned patients appears low, especially if there is a thorough decontamination of the poisoned patient and staff wear appropriate personal protective equipment. The events in Salisbury in the past year were shocking, and the staff at Salisbury District General Hospital performed admirably in treating those affected by Novichok nerve agent poisoning. We eagerly anticipate their future clinical publications so that the medical community might learn from their valuable experiences.},

The primary objective of this study was to investigate the volume administered in a prehospital setting as an independent risk factor for mortality. Material and Methods. Patients who met the following criteria were analyzed retrospectively: Injury Severity Score = 16, primary admission (between 2002 and 2010), and age = 16 years. The following data had to be available: volume administered (including packed red cells), blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale, therapeutic measures, and laboratory results. Following a univariate analysis, independent risk factors for mortality after trauma were investigated using a multivariate regression analysis. Results. A collective of 7,641 patients met the inclusion criteria, showing that increasing volumes administered in a prehospital setting were an independent risk factor for mortality (odds ratio: 1.34). This tendency was even more pronounced in patients without severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) (odds ratio: 2.71), while the opposite tendency was observed in patients with TBI. Conclusions. Prehospital volume therapy in patients without severe TBI represents an independent risk factor for mortality. In such cases, respiratory and circulatory conditions should be stabilized during permissive hypotension, and patient transfer should not be delayed.},

Design:               Multicenter prospective longitudinal observational study.                                         Setting:               Three U.K. major trauma centers.                                         Patients:               Fifty-eight intubated and ventilated patients with traumatic hemorrhagic shock.                                         Interventions:               Sublingual incident dark field microscopy was performed within 12 hours of ICU admission (D0) and repeated 24 and 48 hours later. Cardiac output was assessed using oesophageal Doppler. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was defined as Serial Organ Failure Assessment score greater than or equal to 6 at day 7 post injury.                                         Measurements and Main Results:                                Data from 58 patients were analyzed. Patients had a mean age of 43\,{\textpm}\,19 years, Injury Severity Score of 29\,{\textpm}\,14, and initial lactate of 7.3\,{\textpm}\,6.1 mmol/L and received 6 U (interquartile range, 4--11 U) of packed RBCs during initial resuscitation. Compared with patients without multiple organ dysfunction syndrome at day 7, patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome had lower D0 perfused vessel density (11.2\,{\textpm}\,1.8 and 8.6\,{\textpm}\,1.8\,mm/mm                 2                 ;                 p                 {$<$} 0.01) and microcirculatory flow index (2.8 [2.6--2.9] and 2.6 [2.2--2.8];                 p                 {$<$} 0.01) but similar cardiac index (2.5 [{\textpm} 0.6] and 2.1 [{\textpm} 0.7] L/min//m                 2                 ;                 p                 = 0.11). Perfused vessel density demonstrated the best discrimination for predicting subsequent multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (area under curve 0.87 [0.76--0.99]) compared with highest recorded lactate (area under curve 0.69 [0.53--0.84]), cardiac index (area under curve 0.66 [0.49--0.83]) and lowest recorded systolic blood pressure (area under curve 0.54 [0.39--0.70]).                                                        Conclusions:               Microcirculatory hypoperfusion immediately following traumatic hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation is associated with increased multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Microcirculatory variables are better prognostic indicators for the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome than more traditional indices. Microcirculatory perfusion is a potential endpoint of resuscitation following traumatic hemorrhagic shock.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The effect of decompressive craniectomy on clinical outcomes in patients with refractory traumatic intracranial hypertension remains unclear. METHODS From 2004 through 2014, we randomly assigned 408 patients, 10 to 65 years of age, with traumatic brain injury and refractory elevated intracranial pressure ({$>$}25 mm Hg) to undergo decompressive craniectomy or receive ongoing medical care. The primary outcome was the rating on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) (an 8-point scale, ranging from death to ``upper good recovery'' [no injury-related problems]) at 6 months. The primaryoutcome measure was analyzed with an ordinal method based on the proportional-odds model. If the model was rejected, that would indicate a significant difference in the GOS-E distribution, and results would be reported descriptively. RESULTS The GOS-E distribution differed between the two groups (P{$<$}0.001). The proportional-odds assumption was rejected, and therefore results are reported descriptively. At 6 months, the GOS-E distributions were as follows: death, 26.9\% among 201 patients in the surgical group versus 48.9\% among 188 patients in the medical group; vegetative state, 8.5\% versus 2.1\%; lower severe disability (dependent on others for care), 21.9\% versus 14.4\%; upper severe disability (independent at home), 15.4\% versus 8.0\%; moderate disability, 23.4\% versus 19.7\%; and good recovery, 4.0\% versus 6.9\%. At 12 months, the GOS-E distributions were as follows: death, 30.4\% among 194 surgical patients versus 52.0\% among 179 medical patients; vegetative state, 6.2\% versus 1.7\%; lower severe disability, 18.0\% versus 14.0\%; upper severe disability, 13.4\% versus 3.9\%; moderate disability, 22.2\% versus 20.1\%; and good recovery, 9.8\% versus 8.4\%. Surgical patients had fewer hours than medical patients with intracranial pressure above 25 mm Hg after randomization (median, 5.0 vs. 17.0 hours; P{$<$}0.001) but had a higher rate of adverse events (16.3\% vs. 9.2\%, P\,=\,0.03). CONCLUSIONS At 6 months, decompressive craniectomy in patients with traumatic brain injury and refractory intracranial hypertension resulted in lower mortality and higher rates of vegetative state, lower severe disability, and upper severe disability than medical care. The rates of moderate disability and good recovery were similar in the two groups. (Funded by the Medical Research Council and others; RESCUEicp Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN66202560.)},

There was only moderate interrater agreement among all participants (a{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.47). This lack of agreement persisted across specialties, self-reported training levels, and self-reported ultrasonographic expertise.

In 91\% of cases, the problem  cleared up spontaneously. At the time of the interview, only 9\% of patients had a  residual swallowing difficult. At the time of PPOPS evaluation, rhinolalia was  observed in 8\% of patients, whereas nose regurgitation was present in 2\% of  patients. In 20\% of patients, the foreign body sensation was present during  follow-up. The value of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) reduced from the preoperative  value of 31.5 to the postoperative value of 11.4. Conclusions: BRP surgery proved  to be an effective technique, appreciated by the majority of patients. Use of the  PPOPS questionnaire has demonstrated that the BRP technique seems to ensure  efficacy and lower morbidity, with few complications after surgery.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has been recognized as a deadly complication in sepsis, and its early recognition followed by appropriate management of the underlying infection are the current management strategies. The activation of coagulation, inflammation, and other pathways are fundamental host responses against infection but also produce injury to the host. Recent advances have helped define the critical roles of thrombus formation in overcoming infection. In addition to activation of coagulation induced by pathogens, other important pathways including damage-associated molecular patterns, neutrophil extracellular traps, extracellular vesicles, and glycocalyx damage are involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced DIC. The hallmark of DIC is thrombosis in the microvasculature; however, sepsis-induced DIC is a laboratory diagnosis based on coagulation test results and clinical setting. Although simplified criteria were recently introduced, DIC should be distinguished from other similar conditions such as thrombotic microangiopathy and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. In DIC, treating the underlying cause is crucial, and additional adjunct therapies including antithrombin, thrombomodulin, and heparins may have potential benefit, but evidence supporting their use in terms of improvement of clinically relevant outcomes continues to be debated. In this review, we introduce recent findings regarding the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of sepsis-induced DIC. In addition, we also discuss future potential therapeutic approaches regarding this complex, life-threatening complication.},

Data regarding prolonged storage of other blood components, however, are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate how the duration of platelet storage affects trauma patient outcomes. Methods: Trauma patients admitted to a Level I trauma center requiring platelet transfusion (2006 --2009) were retrospectively identified. Apheresis platelets (aPLT) containing Ն3 ϫ 1011 platelets/unit were used exclusively. Patients were analyzed in three groups: those who received only aPLT stored for Յ3 days, 4 days, and 5 days. The outcomes included mortality and complications (sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal, and liver failure). Results: Three hundred eighty-one patients were available for analysis (128 received aPLT Յ3 days old; 109 ϭ 4 days old; and 144 ϭ 5 days old). There were no significant demographic differences between groups. Patients receiving aPLT aged ϭ 4 days had significantly higher Injury Severity Score (p ϭ 0.022) and were more likely to have a head Abbreviated Injury Scale Ն3 (p ϭ 0.014). There were no differences in volumes transfused or age of RBC, plasma, cryoprecipitate, or factor VIIa. After adjusting for confounders, exposure to older aPLT did not impact mortality; however, with increasing age, complications were significantly higher. The rate of sepsis, in particular, was significantly increased (5.5\% for aPLT Յ3 days vs. 9.2\% for aPLT ϭ 4 days vs. 16.7\% for aPLT ϭ 5 days, adjusted p ϭ 0.033). For acute respiratory distress syndrome and renal and liver failure, similar trends were observed. Conclusions: In critically ill trauma patients, there was a stepwise increase in complications, in particular sepsis, with exposure to progressively older platelets. Further evaluation of the underlying mechanism and methods for minimizing exposure to older platelets is warranted.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Injuries related to button battery ingestion are common in children. This review provides an outline of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, management,  and anesthetic implications in children who have ingested a button battery.  SOURCE: A literature search was conducted in the United States National Library  of Medicine PubMed database using the terms "button battery ingestion" and  "children' and "removal" and "surgery" and "anesthesia". Ninety-six articles  published in English were found from 1983-2017, and 62 of these articles were  incorporated into this review. Additionally, the Internet was searched with the  terms "button battery ingestion and children" to identify further entities,  organizations, and resources affiliated with button battery ingestion in  children. These additional sources were studied and included in this review.  PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Button batteries are ubiquitous in homes and electronic  devices. Since 2006, larger-diameter and higher-voltage batteries have become  available. These are more likely to become impacted in the esophagus after  ingestion and lead to an increase in severe morbidity and mortality due to  caustic tissue injury. Children at the highest risk for complications are those  under six years of age who have ingested batteries {$>$} 20 mm in diameter and  sustain prolonged esophageal impaction at the level of the aortic arch with the  negative pole oriented anteriorly. CONCLUSION: Anesthesiologists need to know  about the epidemiology, pathophysiology, complications, and anesthetic management  of children who have ingested button batteries.},

  abstract = {Binaural beats are an auditory phenomenon that occurs when two tones of different frequencies, which are presented separately to each ear, elicit the sensation of a third tone oscillating at the difference frequency of the two tones. Binaural beats can be perceived in the frequency range of about 1--30 Hz, a range that coincides with the main human EEG frequency bands. The brainwave entrainment hypothesis, which assumes that external stimulation at a certain frequency leads to the brain's electrocortical activity oscillating at the same frequency, provides the basis for research on the effects of binaural beat stimulation on cognitive and affective states. Studies, particularly in more applied fields, usually refer to neuroscientific research demonstrating that binaural beats elicit systematic changes in EEG parameters. At first glance, however, the available literature on brainwave entrainment effects due to binaural beat stimulation appears to be inconclusive at best. The aim of the present systematic review is, thus, to synthesize existing empirical research. A sample of fourteen published studies met our criteria for inclusion. The results corroborate the impression of an overall inconsistency of empirical outcomes, with five studies reporting results in line with the brainwave entrainment hypothesis, eight studies reporting contradictory, and one mixed results. What is to be noticed is that the fourteen studies included in this review were very heterogeneous regarding the implementation of the binaural beats, the experimental designs, and the EEG parameters and analyses. The methodological heterogeneity in this field of study ultimately limits the comparability of research outcomes. The results of the present systematic review emphasize the need for standardization in study approaches so as to allow for reliable insight into brainwave entrainment effects in the future.},

Design, Setting, and Patients Prospective, randomized controlled trial of consecutive adult patients with out-of-hospital nontraumatic cardiac arrest treated within the emergency medical service system in Oslo, Norway, between May 1, 2003, and April 28, 2008. Interventions Advanced cardiac life support with intravenous drug administration or ACLS without access to intravenous drug administration. Main Outcome Measures The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. The secondary outcomes were 1-year survival, survival with favorable neurological outcome, hospital admission with return of spontaneous circulation, and quality of CPR (chest compression rate, pauses, and ventilation rate). Results Of 1183 patients for whom resuscitation was attempted, 851 were included; 418 patients were in the ACLS with intravenous drug administration group and 433 were in the ACLS with no access to intravenous drug administration group. The rate of survival to hospital discharge was 10.5\% for the intravenous drug administration group and 9.2\% for the no intravenous drug administration group (P=.61), 32\% vs 21\%, respectively, (PϽ.001) for hospital admission with return of spontaneous circulation, 9.8\% vs 8.1\% (P=.45) for survival with favorable neurological outcome, and 10\% vs 8\% (P=.53) for survival at 1 year. The quality of CPR was comparable and within guideline recommendations for both groups. After adjustment for ventricular fibrillation, response interval, witnessed arrest, or arrest in a public location, there was no significant difference in survival to hospital discharge for the intravenous group vs the no intravenous group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.15; 95\% confidence interval, 0.69-1.91). Conclusion Compared with patients who received ACLS without intravenous drug administration following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, patients with intravenous access and drug administration had higher rates of short-term survival with no statistically significant improvement in survival to hospital discharge, quality of CPR, or long-term survival.

Often, patients with psychiatric conditions repeatedly ingest foreign bodies, leading to frequent emergency department visits. Standardised management guidelines are lacking, resulting in high hospitalisation rates, interventions, and complications. This study focuses on recent DFBI cases at our institution, providing insights into this complex condition and holistic management. Methods: Patients admitted by the surgical team at Croydon University Hospital between 2017 and 2023 with DFBI were included. Data on demographics, clinical presentation, investigations, and management were collected. Complications, hospitalisations, interventions, and cost analysis were recorded. Results: Eight patients presented a total of 52 times. The incidence of DFBI increased over time. Swallowed objects included knives, needles, magnets, glass, batteries, pencils, gloves, lighters, and screws. Each patient underwent an average of 21 X-rays, 2 CT scans, and 3 OGDs. Eleven laparotomies and 1 laparoscopy were performed. The average length of stay was 44.5 days. Complications included pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, enterotomy, hernia, and infection. The average cost per patient was {\pounds}30,866.25. Conclusions: DFBI poses a significant burden on healthcare systems. Patients face radiation exposure and repeated invasive interventions, necessitating a comprehensive approach. Understanding DFBI from a biopsychosocial and ethical perspective is crucial. A multidisciplinary team should be involved early, with clear goals. Further research is needed for optimal management pathways.},

METHODS:  Retrospective study, included all patients undergoing RE or FE for impacted UGIT  foreign body over an 11-year-period. RESULTS: A total of 144 patients were  included (95 FE and 49 RE). FE were performed under local anaesthetic or  sedation, and RE under GA. Success rate of FE and RE were 95.8\% and 95.9\%  respectively. During FE an intra-procedural biopsy was performed in 45/95  (47.3\%); with 26/95(27.4\%) identifying mucosal pathology. Complications was  significantly higher in patients having RE (40.8\% versus 6.3\%, p\,=\,.001).  CONCLUSION: FE and RE are effective for the therapeutic management of impacted  UGIT foreign bodies. However, FE can be performed under LA and was associated  with fewer complications, favouring FE where possible as a first line option.},

The chest radiograph showed metallic foreign bodies in both main bronchi; foreign bodies in the stomach were not observed clinically. The woman died from repeated cardiac arrest shortly after hospital admission. At the autopsy a screw and a nail were found in both main bronchi. The abdominal cavity contained 2 L of greenish purulent fluid and a massive fibrinoid peritonitis was observed. Two perforations of the stomach, each 1 cm in diameter, were detected. The stomach was completely filled with a mass of metallic foreign bodies, greenish fluid, and a bezoar of a total weight of 1,400 g; 422 distinguishable and mostly metallic foreign bodies were counted. Death was attributed to cardiac arrest in delayed shock after massive purulent peritonitis caused by two gastric perforations combined with obstruction of the airways by aspirated foreign bodies. Cases of massive swallowing of foreign bodies are mainly restricted to mentally handicapped persons, especially schizophrenics, whereas acute impaction of the larynx by large food particles occurs nearly exclusively in heavily intoxicated adults.},

  abstract = {Background: There is little evidence from clinical trials that the use of adrenaline (epinephrine) in treating cardiac arrest improves survival, despite adrenaline being considered standard of care for many decades. The aim of our study was to determine the effect of adrenaline on patient survival to hospital discharge in out of hospital cardiac arrest. Methods: We conducted a double blind randomised placebo-controlled trial of adrenaline in out-ofhospital cardiac arrest. Identical study vials containing either adrenaline 1:1000 or placebo (sodium chloride 0.9\%) were prepared. Patients were randomly allocated to receive 1 ml aliquots of the trial drug according to current advanced life support guidelines. Outcomes assessed included survival to hospital discharge (primary outcome), pre-hospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category Score -- CPC). Results: A total of 4103 cardiac arrests were screened during the study period of which 601 underwent randomisation. Documentation was available for a total of 534 patients: 262 in the placebo group and 272 in the adrenaline group. Groups were well matched for baseline characteristics including age, gender and receiving bystander CPR. ROSC occurred in 22 (8.4\%) of patients receiving placebo and 64 (23.5\%) who received adrenaline (OR = 3.4; 95\% CI 2.0--5.6). Survival to hospital discharge occurred in 5 (1.9\%) and 11 (4.0\%) patients receiving placebo or adrenaline respectively (OR = 2.2; 95\% CI 0.7--6.3). All but two patients (both in the adrenaline group) had a CPC score of 1--2. Conclusion: Patients receiving adrenaline during cardiac arrest had no statistically significant improvement in the primary outcome of survival to hospital discharge although there was a significantly improved likelihood of achieving ROSC.},

  abstract = {Intentional foreign body ingestions (FBIs) are commonly seen in adult patients with intellectual disabilities, substance use, severe psychiatric conditions, or  external motivations, but these cases are rarely reported in the psychiatric  literature. We present the case of a patient with an extensive history of FBIs  and suicide attempts and a multitude of psychiatric diagnoses including  borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress  disorder from significant abuse in foster care, obsessive-compulsive disorder,  and pica. During the single hospitalization described in this report, she had  multiple incidents of self-harm, aggression, and 9 FBIs. A multidisciplinary team  involving psychiatry, emergency medicine, gastroenterology, surgery, internal  medicine, nursing, social work, behavioral health technicians, case management,  chaplain, the legal department, police officers, and hospital maintenance was  necessary for care coordination. Interventions included 8 endoscopies and an  abdominal surgery to retrieve swallowed foreign bodies, pain management,  psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions for agitation, and  environmental precautions to minimize the risk of ingestion. Ultimately, to  prevent further trauma and limit additional opportunities for FBI, a  collaborative decision was made with the patient to discharge her to her home  with outpatient psychologist and psychiatrist support. This case describes the  complexities of hospital management of a patient with intentional recurrent FBI,  highlighting the importance of a critical assessment of risk versus benefit for  prolonging hospitalization. Development of practical management protocols and  risk assessments for continued hospitalization is necessary for patients with  recurrent intentional FBIs.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients often face difficulties with swallowing, which can be due to the cancer itself or the treatment modalities like radiation therapy. The presentation of HNC can vary between developing and developed countries due to socioeconomic factors. The current study aimed to profile the swallowing function of HNC patients before starting radiation therapy in a tertiary hospital in India. Method: This cross-sectional observational study examined patients with HNC who were scheduled for radiation therapy. The Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) and Karnofsky Performance Status Scale were used to assess the patients' swallowing status and functional abilities, respectively. The study also evaluated the relationship between swallowing function and clinical-demographic factors. Results: Our assessment of 162 HNC patients found that the cancer site significantly affects swallowing. Although 92\% of patients had an oral diet, 64\% made dietary modifications. Patients with non-oral intake had either oral or pharyngeal cancer, and over 80\% of oral cancer patients and 60\% of those with pharyngeal cancer had already made changes to their diet. Patients with laryngeal cancer had a better oral intake, with 58\% reporting no swallowing issues. Conclusion: Patients with HNC scheduled for radiation therapy may experience varying degrees of swallowing difficulty. Early intervention and teaching of safe swallowing strategies are crucial to prepare for the potential worsening of swallowing difficulties resulting from the treatment. Advanced tumor stages and oral/pharyngeal cancers increase the risk of significant swallowing issues.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Foreign body ingestion is a common problem among paediatric populations. A variety of foreign bodies are ingested, some of which are particularly harmful and life threatening such as button batteries, magnets and bones. Common household items such as small toys, marbles, batteries and erasers are often ingested. The aim of this systematic review is to study the problem of foreign body ingestion among paediatric populations in terms of commonly ingested objects, and attempt to identify the link between location of impaction, associated symptoms, complications, spontaneous passage, methods and timing of removal. METHODS: A literature search of multiple databases including PubMed, Embase, Current Contents Connect and Medline were conducted for studies on foreign body ingestions. Based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 studies were selected. A qualitative review of these studies was then performed to identify commonly ingested foreign bodies, symptoms, signs and complications of foreign body ingestion, rates of spontaneous passage and methods of retrieval of the ingested objects. RESULTS: Coins are the most commonly ingested foreign body. A variety of gastrointestinal symptoms such vomiting and drooling as well as respiratory symptoms such as coughing and stridor are associated with foreign body ingestion. The oesophagus, in particular the upper third, is the common site of foreign body obstruction. Objects in the stomach and intestine were spontaneously passed more frequently than at any other sites in the gastrointestinal system. Complications such as bowel perforations, infection and death are more commonly associated with ingestion of objects such as batteries and sharp objects such as bones and needles. Ingested objects are most commonly removed by endoscopic means. CONCLUSION: Foreign body ingestion is a common paediatric problem. Batteries and sharp objects should be removed immediately to avoid complications while others can be observed for spontaneous passage. Endoscopy has a high success rate in removing ingested foreign bodies.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is controversy about the effectiveness of adrenaline in traumatic cardiac arrest. This study reports the patient characteristics and outcomes of adults with trauma-related out of hospital cardiac arrest treated with adrenaline or placebo. METHODS: This post-hoc, sub-group analysis of the Pre-hospital Randomised Assessment of Adrenaline in Cardiac Arrest-2 (PARAMEDIC-2) trial explored the effect of adrenaline on survival to hospital admission, longer-term survival and neurological outcomes amongst adults with trauma related out of hospital cardiac arrest. Individual patients were randomised through opening a single treatment pack which contained either 10 doses of 1~mg adrenaline or 0.9\% saline placebo. Treating clinicians, investigators, outcome assessors and patients were blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was survival to 30~days post cardiac arrest. RESULTS: 123 of 8,014 enrolled patients (1.5\%) sustained a traumatic cardiac arrest (66 in the adrenaline arm and 57 in the placebo arm). Three times as many patients were admitted to hospital alive in the adrenaline arm 16/66 (24.2\%) compared to 5/56 (8.9\%) in the placebo arm, unadjusted odds ratio 3.3 (95\% confidence interval 1.1 to 9.6), p~=~0.03; adjusted odd ratio 5.6 (95\% CI 1.6 to 20.4), p~=~0.009. A single patient, in the adrenaline arm, survived beyond 30~days (1/66 (1.5\%) compared to 0/57 (0\%)), who also experienced a favourable neurological outcome. CONCLUSION: Adrenaline was associated with a trebling of the rate of survival to hospital admission. These data support the use of adrenaline in trauma related out of hospital cardiac arrest.

  abstract = {Background Recently, the concept of sepsis was redefined by an international task force. This international task force of experts recommended using the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) criteria instead of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria to classify patients at high risk for death. However, the added value of these new criteria in the emergency department (ED) remains unclear. Thus, we performed this meta-analysis to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the qSOFA criteria in predicting mortality in ED patients with infections and compared the performance with that of the SIRS criteria. Methods PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar (up to April 2018) were searched for related articles. A 2\,{\texttimes}\,2 contingency table was constructed according to mortality and qSOFA score ({$<$}\,2 and\,{$\geq$}\,2) or SIRS score ({$<$}\,2 and\,{$\geq$}\,2) in ED patients with infections. Two investigators independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data. We used a bivariate meta-analysis model to determine the prognostic value of qSOFA and SIRS in predicting mortality. We used the I2 index to test heterogeneity. The bivariate random-effects regression model was used to pool the individual sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and negative likelihood ratio (NLR). The summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) was constructed to assess the overall diagnostic accuracy. Results Eight studies with a total of 52,849 patients were included. A qSOFA score\,{$\geq$}\,2 was associated with a higher risk of mortality in ED patients with infections, with a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 4.55 (95\% CI, 3.38--6.14) using a random-effects model (I2\,=\,91.1\%). A SIRS score\,{$\geq$}\,2 was a prognostic marker of mortality in ED patients with infections, with a pooled RR of 2.75 (95\% CI, 1.96--3.86) using a random-effects model (I2\,=\,89\%). When comparing the performance of qSOFA and SIRS in predicting mortality, a qSOFA score\,{$\geq$}\,2 was more specific; however a SIRS score\,{$\geq$}\,2 was more sensitive. The initial qSOFA values were of limited prognostic value in ED patients with infections. Conclusions A qSOFA score\,{$\geq$}\,2 and SIRS score\,{$\geq$}\,2 are strongly associated with mortality in ED patients with infections. However, it is also clear that qSOFA and SIRS have limitations as risk stratification tools for ED patients with infections.

Case Presentation:~           The authors present the case of a 39-year-old man who arrived at the hospital with symptoms of abdominal distension and occasional black stools for a week. The patient was known to have schizophrenia but had not received regular hospital follow-up or treatment for the past 5 years. He had a history of exogenous stimulation, which led him to surreptitiously swallow metallic objects. Upon physical examination, he displayed abdominal distension and mild tenderness in the upper abdomen. Radiographs revealed multiple foreign objects in his stomach, leading to the decision for laparotomy, gastric opening, and removal of the foreign objects under general anesthesia.           Clinical Discussion:~           Mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and multiple substance abuse, are recognized as being significant risk factors for ingesting foreign bodies. In such cases, it is crucial to intervene quickly. For patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms, the involvement of family caregivers is of even greater importance than endoscopic or surgical treatments.           Conclusion:~           Foreign body ingestion is more prevalent in individuals with psychosis, highlighting the importance of ongoing care and follow-up for patients with mental illness.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: It is debated whether early trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) in severely injured patients reflects disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with a fibrinolytic phenotype, acute coagulopathy of trauma shock (ACoTS) or yet other entities. This study investigated the prevalence of overt DIC and ACoTS in trauma patients and characterized these conditions based on their biomarker profiles. METHODS: An observational study was carried out at a single Level I Trauma Center. Eighty adult trauma patients ({$\geq$}18 years) who met criteria for full trauma team activation and had an arterial cannula inserted were included. Blood was sampled a median of 68 minutes (IQR 48 to 88) post-injury. Data on demography, biochemistry, injury severity score (ISS) and mortality were recorded. Plasma/serum was analyzed for biomarkers reflecting tissue/endothelial cell/glycocalyx damage (histone-complexed DNA fragments, Annexin V, thrombomodulin, syndecan-1), coagulation activation/inhibition (prothrombinfragment 1+2, thrombin/antithrombin-complexes, antithrombin, protein C, activated protein C, endothelial protein C receptor, protein S, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, vWF), factor consumption (fibrinogen, FXIII), fibrinolysis (D-dimer, tissue-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) and inflammation (interleukin (IL)-6, terminal complement complex (sC5b-9)). Comparison of patients stratified according to the presence or absence of overt DIC (International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) criteria) or ACoTS (activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and/or international normalized ratio (INR) above normal reference). RESULTS: No patients had overt DIC whereas 15\% had ACoTS. ACoTS patients had higher ISS, transfusion requirements and mortality (all P {$<$} 0.01) and a biomarker profile suggestive of enhanced tissue, endothelial cell and glycocalyx damage and consumption coagulopathy with low protein C, antithrombin, fibrinogen and FXIII levels, hyperfibrinolysis and inflammation (all P {$<$} 0.05). Importantly, in non-ACoTS patients, apart from APTT/INR, higher ISS correlated with biomarkers of enhanced tissue, endothelial cell and glycocalyx damage, protein C activation, coagulation factor consumption, hyperfibrinolysis and inflammation, that is, resembling that observed in patients with ACoTS. CONCLUSIONS: ACoTS and non-ACoTS may represent a continuum of coagulopathy reflecting a progressive early evolutionarily adapted hemostatic response to the trauma hit and both are parts of TIC whereas DIC does not appear to be part of this early response.},

Despite the different types of injurious ``hit'', acutely critically ill patients share several phenotypic features that may be driven by the shock. This response, mounted by the body to various life-threatening conditions, is relatively homogenous and most likely evolutionarily adapted. We propose that shock-induced sympatho-adrenal hyperactivation is a critical driver of endothelial cell and glycocalyx damage (endotheliopathy) in acute critical illness, with the overall aim of ensuring organ perfusion through an injured microvasculature. We have investigated more than 3000 patients suffering from different types of acute critical illness (severe trauma, sepsis, MI and PCAS) and have found a potential unifying pathologic link between sympathoadrenal hyperactivation, endotheliopathy, and poor outcome. We entitled this proposed disease entity, shockinduced endotheliopathy (SHINE). Here we review the literature and discuss the pathophysiology of SHINE.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chest radiography (CXR) is the test of choice for diagnosing pneumonia. Lung ultrasonography (LUS) has been shown to be accurate for diagnosing pneumonia in children and may be an alternative to CXR. Our objective was to determine the feasibility and safety of substituting LUS for CXR when evaluating children suspected of having pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a randomized control trial comparing LUS with CXR in 191 children from birth to 21 years of age suspected of having pneumonia in an ED. Patients in the investigational arm underwent LUS. If there was clinical uncertainty after ultrasonography, physicians had the option to perform CXR. Patients in the control arm underwent sequential imaging with CXR followed by LUS. The primary outcome was the rate of CXR reduction; secondary outcomes were missed pneumonia, subsequent unscheduled health-care visits, and adverse events between the investigational and control arms. RESULTS: There was a 38.8\% reduction (95\% CI, 30.0\%-48.9\%) in CXR among investigational subjects compared with no reduction (95\% CI, 0.0\%-3.6\%) in the control group. Novice and experienced physician-sonologists achieved 30.0\% and 60.6\% reduction in CXR use, respectively. There were no cases of missed pneumonia among all study participants (investigational arm, 0.0\%: 95\% CI, 0.0\%-2.9\%; control arm, 0.0\%: 95\% CI, 0.0\%-3.0\%), or differences in adverse events, or subsequent unscheduled health-care visits between arms. CONCLUSIONS: It may be feasible and safe to substitute LUS for CXR when evaluating children suspected of having pneumonia with no missed cases of pneumonia or increase in rates of adverse events.},

Methods:               This was a prospective, observational, educational study of the impact of a focused training course on the change in physician performance on pre- and postcourse examinations testing competency in goal-directed TTE defined by five criteria: 1) image orientation, 2) anatomy identification, 3) chamber size grading, 4) ventricular function estimation, and 5) pericardial effusion identification. Subjects included were emergency medicine residents with between ten and 20 hours of noncardiac ultrasound didactics and between 20 and {$>$}150 proctored noncardiac ultrasound examinations. All underwent five hours of focused echocardiography didactics and one hour of proctored practical echocardiography training designed and implemented by an emergency physician ultrasound director and a cardiologist. Before the start of the training course, participants completed two examinations: 1) written 23-question test on the above concepts and 2) performance of a TTE on a healthy subject testing 16 elements that define a properly performed examination.

The percentage correct on the precourse practical examination was 56\% (95\% CI = 51\% to 60\%), and the postcourse examination score was 94\% (95\% CI = 91\% to 96\%) (p {$<$} 0.005).               Conclusions:               A focused six-hour echocardiography training course significantly improved emergency medicine residents' percentage scores on both written and practical examinations testing essential components required for correct goal-directed TTE performance and interpretation.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Intentional ingestion of foreign objects (IIFO) is prevalent among U.S. prisoners. IIFOs often require surgical or endoscopic interventions, extended hospital stays, and may result in significant morbidity or even mortality. Although psychiatric illness is prevalent among prisoners engaging in IIFO, this association remains poorly defined. The aim of this study is to describe the psychiatric illness profile among prisoners diagnosed with IIFO. We hypothesized that repeated episodes of IIFO are associated with an escalating pattern of documented psychiatric illness. Methods: After approvals were obtained from our Institutional Review Board and the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, a retrospective study was conducted of prisoners presenting to our facility with IIFO between 2004 and 2011. All historical and concurrent psychiatric diagnoses were abstracted from the medical record and classified into Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition based categories. In addition, medical history, alcohol/drug use, and prior episodes of IIFO were recorded. Statistical analyses included Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests for categorical and continuous data, respectively. Results: We analyzed 136 IIFO episodes involving 27 patients. Repeat IIFO episodes were associated with an increasing number of psychiatric diagnoses. Patients with their fifth or later IIFO had a larger number of psychiatric diagnoses and the number of objects ingested as compared to patients presenting with a first episode (P {$<$} 0.01). Similarly, patients who went on to present with additional episodes of IIFO during the study had more psychiatric diagnoses identified throughout their visits (P {$<$} 0.01). The proportion of patients with mood and anxiety disorders (including post-traumatic stress) was progressively greater among prisoners with recurrent episodes of IIFO (P {$<$} 0.05). Other psychiatric disorders were not significantly associated with IIFO escalation. Conclusions: We observed a significant association between IIFO recurrences and increases in both the quantity of ingested items and the number of documented psychiatric diagnoses. Of note, psychiatric diagnoses of malingering or secondary gain were not identified in the current patient sample. Consideration of early psychiatric evaluation and intervention in the setting of IIFO, especially recurrent IIFO, is strongly encouraged. The following core competencies are addressed in this article: Medical knowledge, Patient care, Systems-based practice.},

  abstract = {Methods: We analyzed data from the Pragmatic, Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios trial. Subjects in the parent trial included critically injured adult patients admitted to 1 of 12 North American Level I trauma centers who received at least 1 unit of packed RBCs and were predicted to require massive blood transfusion. The primary exposure was volume of packed RBC units transfused during the first 24 hours of hospitalization, stratified by packed RBC age category: 0 to 7 days, 8 to 14 days, 15 to 21 days, and greater than or equal to 22 days. The primary outcome was 24-hour mortality. We evaluated the association between transfused volume of each packed RBC age category and 24-hour survival, using random-effects logistic regression, adjusting for total packed RBC volume, patient age, sex, race, mechanism of injury, Injury Severity Score, Revised Trauma Score, clinical site, and trial treatment group. Results: The 678 patients included in the analysis received a total of 8,830 packed RBC units. One hundred patients (14.8\%) died within the first 24 hours. On multivariable analysis, the number of packed RBCs greater than or equal to 22 days old was independently associated with increased 24-hour mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.05 per packed RBC unit; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.08): OR 0.97 for 0 to 7 days old (95\% CI 0.88 to 1.08), OR 1.04 for 8 to 14 days old (95\% CI 0.99 to 1.09), and OR 1.02 for 15 to 21 days old (95\% CI 0.98 to 1.06). Results of sensitivity analyses were similar only among patients who received greater than or equal to 10 packed RBC units. Conclusion: Increasing quantities of older packed RBCs are associated with increased likelihood of 24-hour mortality in trauma patients receiving massive packed RBC transfusion ( 10 units), but not in those who receive fewer than 10 units.

  abstract = {Introduction: Deliberate foreign body ingestion (DFBI) can occur in patients with psychiatric disorders, intellectual disabilities, and prisoners. Repeated ingestions impose a high burden on staff and resources. Despite the increasing incidence of such behaviours, there is limited literature to provide effective preventative and therapeutic strategies. Aims \& Methods: We aimed to assess the characteristics of patients admitted with DFBI, report the types of foreign bodies ingested and evaluate the medical care and outcomes of those presentations. Adult patients with endoscopic records of attempted foreign body retrieval between April 2013 and September 2020 were identified retrospectively from endoscopic databases at three metropolitan hospitals within South Australia and an outer metropolitan hospital in Queensland. Only patients with intentional ingestion and underlying mental health illness were included in the study. Standard medical records were reviewed and data collected included: demographics, comorbidities and endoscopy-related, mental health-related and admission-related information. Descriptive statistics were applied. Results: Patient demographics, comorbidities and admission details are summarised in Table 1. Between 1 and 25 foreign bodies were ingested per episode with a mean number of 3.6 (SD 3.7). Most ingested objects were: razor blades and miscellaneous sharp objects (60\%), followed by button batteries (18\%) and dry cell lithium batteries (16\%). The proportion of admissions involving button batteries was observed to have increased over the 8-year study period-14 and 13 admissions reported in 2018 and 2019 respectively, compared to just 4 admissions between 2014 and 2015. Endoscopic retrieval was attempted in 160 cases with success in 111 cases, partial success in 18 cases where not all the FB were retrieved. The mean time from presentation to endoscopy procedure was 13.9 hours (SD 27.2). Only three cases of perforations leading to laparotomies were reported, 2 due to a sharp object and one to a magnet. Conclusion: We describe an increasing prevalence of DFBI in our cohort over the duration of the study, largely from patients with borderline personality disorder. A small proportion of patients have serious complications, such as gastrointestinal perforations. The increase in button battery consumption does not equate to an increase in serious complications. DFBI leads to a high number of unnecessary hospital admission stays likely associated with a huge healthcare cost burden.},

We aimed to profile the characteristics and  evaluate the care of such patients in this study. METHODS: Adult patients with an  endoscopic record of attempted foreign body retrieval between January 2013 and  September 2020 were identified at three Australian hospitals. Those with a  documented mental health diagnosis were included and their standard medical  records reviewed. Presentation history, demographics, comorbidities and  endoscopic findings were recorded and described. RESULTS: A total of 166  admissions were accounted for by 35 patients, 2/3 of which had borderline  personality disorder (BPD). Repetitive presentations occurred in more than half  of the cohort. There was an increased trend of hospital admissions throughout the  years. At least half of the cohort had a documented mental health review during  their admission. An average of 3.3 (2.9) foreign bodies were ingested per single  episode. Endoscopic intervention was performed in 76.5\% of incidents. The  combined Length of stay for all patients was 680~days. CONCLUSION: Deliberate  foreign body ingestion in mental health patients is a common, recurring and  challenging problem that is increasing in frequency and requires collaborative  research to further guide holistic management.},

TDI measurements are also helpful to identify patients who will benefit from cardiac resynchronisation therapy. Even though it is reproducible and relatively easy to obtain, it is underutilised in routine clinical practice. TDI is readily available on most commercially available echocardiographic systems, and we recommend that TDI be used for routine clinical echocardiographic evaluation of patients.},

Children undergoing outpatient surgery were randomized to 3 groups: interactive music therapy (n = 51), oral midazolam (n = 34), or control (n = 38). The primary outcome of the study was children's perioperative anxiety. We found that children who received midazolam were significantly less anxious during the induction of anesthesia than children in the music therapy and control groups (P = 0.015 and P = 0.005, respectively). We found no difference in anxiety during the induction of anesthesia between children in the music therapy group and children in the control group. An analysis controlling for therapist revealed a significant therapist effect; i.e., children treated by one of the therapists were significantly less anxious than children in the other therapist group and the control group on separation to the operating room (OR) (P {$<$} 0.05) and on entrance to the OR (P {$<$} 0.05), but not on the introduction of the anesthesia mask (P = not significant). Children in the midazolam group were the least anxious even after controlling for therapist effect (P {$<$} 0.05). We conclude that music therapy may be helpful on separation and entrance to the OR, depending on the therapist. However, music therapy does not appear to relieve anxiety during the induction of anesthesia. IMPLICATIONS: Depending on the music therapist, interactive music therapy may relieve anxiety on separation and entrance to the operating room but appears less effective during the induction of anesthesia.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: In our country, safety pin ingestion by infants is commonplace. When swallowed, open safety pins are mostly found within the esophagus or stomach, and  they cannot be easily removed by rigid esophagogastroscopy. Our aim was to  evaluate the removal of safety pins using flexible endoscopy in infants.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the cases of 7 infants who had ingested open  safety pins between 2001 and 2004. In all the patients, the primary diagnostic  tool was a direct x-ray of the neck, chest, and abdomen. In all cases, the safety  pins were removed by flexible esophagogastroduo-denoscopy. Clinical records for  the cases were reviewed. RESULTS: Four of the open safety pins were lodged in the  esophagus, two in the stomach, and one in the duodenum. One infant had a safety  pin lodged in the esophagus with the pin's open end pointed caudally; the pin was  held with the endoscopic forceps by its tail end and removed. Three safety pins  in the esophagus had their open ends pointing cephalad; these were held by their  tail ends using the endoscopic forceps and pushed into the stomach. Then they  were rotated in the stomach and removed tail end first. The safety pins located  in the stomach or duodenum were also removed similarly. All safety pins were  successfully removed, and there were no operative complications. CONCLUSION: Open  surgery or other invasive removal methods are not necessary in infants with open  safety pin ingestions. In our opinion, the best way to extract an open safety pin  from the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum is by using a flexible endoscopic  device.},

Mortality reduction was seen with observational studies: relative risk = 0.73 (0.67--0.80);                 p                 value of less than 0.0001 but not with randomized studies: relative risk = 0.92 (0.78--1.07);                 p                 = 0.268. Meta-regression analysis showed lower risk of death in observational compared with randomized studies: relative risk = 0.81 (0.68--0.95);                 p                 = 0.01. Differences in age, country, hospital location, era, systolic pressure, mean arterial pressure, lactate, bundle compliance, amount of fluid administered, and hemodynamic goal achievements were not associated with survival differences between studies. Factors associated with mortality differences between early goal-directed therapy and control included Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (relative risk = 1.05 [1.02--1.09];                 p                 = 0.003), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (relative risk = 1.09 [1.00--1.18];                 p                 = 0.04), presence of shock (relative risk = 1.007 [1.002--1.013];                 p                 = 0.006), time-to-first antibiotic (relative risk = 1.22 [1.09--1.36];                 p                 = 0.0006), antibiotic administration within 6 hours (relative risk = 0.20 [0.09--0.45];                 p                 = 0.0001), 4 hours (relative risk = 0.16 [0.06--0.39];                 p                 = 0.0001), and 3 hours (relative risk = 0.09 [0.03--0.27];                 p                 {$<$} 0.0001). The only factors that explained mortality differences between randomized and observational studies were time-to-first antibiotic (                 R                 2                 = 87\%), antibiotic administration within 6 hours (                 R                 2                 = 94\%), 4 hours (                 R                 2                 = 99\%), 3 hours (                 R                 2                 = 99\%), and appropriate antibiotic use (                 R                 2                 = 96\%).                                                        Conclusions:               Survival discordance was not associated with differences in early goal-directed therapy bundle compliance or hemodynamic goal achievement. Our results suggest that it was associated with faster and more appropriate antibiotic co-intervention in the early goal-directed therapy arm compared with controls in the observational studies but not in the randomized trials. Early goal-directed therapy was associated with increased mortality in patients with high-disease severity.},

Methods: Data from 01.01.2001 until 31.12.2010 was collected from the Oslo University Hospital Trauma Registry and from the patients' records. Results: Thirty-one patients were admitted with a penetrating cardiac injury. Fourteen patients survived (45 \%). Four out of 8 patients (50 \%) with gunshot wounds survived compared to 10 out of 23 (44 \%) with stab wounds. Median (quartiles) for the following values were: Injury Severity Score 25 (21--35), Revised Trauma Score 0 (0--6,9), Probability of Survival 0,015 (0,004--0,956), Glasgow Coma Scale 3 (3--13). Thirteen patients had signs of life on admission and survived. Eighteen patients were admitted without signs of life and received emergency department thoracotomy. Eight of these had no signs of life at the scene of injury and did not survive. Out of the remaining 10 patients, one survived. Conclusions: The outcome of patients with penetrating cardiac injury reaching the emergency department with signs of life was excellent. Hemodynamic instability indicates immediate surgery. Stable patients with penetrating thoracic trauma and possible cardiac injury detected by imaging should be considered for conservative treatment.},

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type of complication, treatment and operative outcome. FINDINGS: The patients ranged in age from 26 to 46 years. One patient died while awaiting surgical consultation of massive gastrointestinal bleeding from a large gastric ulcer caused by a vinyl glove bezoar (VGB). Four VGBs were removed surgically. Endoscopic removal was difficult or impossible because the gloves had become hardened and matted. CONCLUSIONS: VGB should be considered in institutionalized mentally retarded people with a history of pica when they present with gastrointestinal symptoms. VGBs should be removed directly by laparotomy, gastrotomy or enterotomy. Endoscopic removal is not recommended.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the cases of foreign body in the aerodigestive tract and to elucidate the characteristic problems in India. DESIGN AND SETTING: Three  hundred patients presenting with a history of either aspirating or swallowing a  foreign body were analyzed in a tertiary care center. Data were collected by  retrospective chart review and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 300  patients studied, 90\% (270 cases) did have a retained foreign body, with 233  (86.2\%) cases found in the pharyngoesophagus and 37 (13.7\%) cases in the  tracheobronchial tree. With foreign bodies in the tracheobronchial passages, the  most common sign and symptom were rhonchi (50\%) and dyspnea (67\%), respectively;  in pharyngoesophagus, the most common symptom and sign were dysphagia (64\%) and  odynophagia (45\%), respectively. The most common foreign body found was fish bone  in 39\% (106 cases) and the most common site of lodgment was the cervical  esophagus 50.5\% (136 cases). Rigid endoscopy with forceps removal under general  anesthesia was the main treatment modality. Thirty-three (12.2\%) cases had  complications secondary to retained foreign body. CONCLUSION: Foreign bodies in  the aerodigestive tract continue to be a common problem affecting adults and  children alike. Rigid endoscopies with forceps removal under general anesthesia  are the preferred management modality. From their experience, the authors  recommend that no foreign body in the upper aerodigestive tract should be left  alone with the hope that it will come out spontaneously. Delay in diagnosis and  management can lead to life-threatening complications.},

We also discuss drug choice for induction and peri-intubation instability, difficult airway considerations as well as postintubation care. Focus is also given on the value of preintubation checklists, both in terms of equipment selection and in the context of staff role designation and intubation plan clarity. Finally, in cases of failed intubation, we recommend the application of the Vortex approach, highlighting, thus, the importance of avoiding task fixation and maintaining our focus on what matters most: adequate oxygenation.},

Sodium-glucose  cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor has become one of the most common causes of  EDKA. We present one of the lowest presenting blood glucose levels for the EDKA  in the setting of SGLT2 inhibitor use. A 34-year-old female with a two-year  history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) presented after accidental ingestion  of a metal clip and lack of oral intake for 28 hours. She reported a recent  intentional weight loss of 60 lbs. She takes metformin 1000 mg twice daily and  empagliflozin 25 mg daily. An urgent endoscopy was planned in the intensive care  unit given the proximal location of the foreign body. The basic metabolic profile  after the procedure demonstrated a glucose level of 75 mg/dL, bicarbonate level  of 11 mmol/L, and AG of 17 mmol/L. The venous pH was 7.27 with a partial pressure  of carbon dioxide of 30 mmHg. The urinalysis showed a glucose level greater than  500 {$\mu$}mol/L with a ketone level of 80 {$\mu$}mol/L. The blood and urine toxicology  screening results were unremarkable. The patient was treated for EDKA with the  administration of intravenous (IV) dextrose 5\% in water with subsequent  initiation of IV insulin. The assessment of her insulin reserve revealed a low  C-peptide of 0.36 ng/mL, a high glutamic acid decarboxylase level greater than  250 IU/mL, and~high zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) antibodies of 42 U/mL, consistent  with an undiagnosed transition to latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).  The blood glucose levels for previously reported cases remain between 90 and 250  mg/dL. In this case, the combination of a low carbohydrate diet and prolonged  starvation may have led to the impressively low glucose. Additionally, the SGLT2  inhibitor use in patients with LADA serves as one of the known risk factors for  EDKA. EDKA poses a diagnostic challenge, especially in the ICU setting where  there exists a myriad of causes for high AG metabolic acidosis. Additionally,  many of the ICU patients are in a ketotic state brought on by prolonged  starvation. Therefore, prompt diagnosis and treatment for EDKA require careful  history taking and complete investigation for other causes of high AG metabolic  acidosis.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of the study was to compare the effect of limited echocardiography (LE)--guided therapy to standard management on 28-day mortality, intravenous fluid prescription, and inotropic dosing following early resuscitation for shock. Materials and methods: Two hundred twenty critically ill patients with undifferentiated shock from a quaternary intensive care unit were included in the study. The LE group consisted of 110 consecutive patients prospectively studied over a 12-month period receiving LE-guided management. The standard management group consisted of 110 consecutive patients retrospectively studied with shock immediately prior to the LE intervention. Results: In the LE group, fluid restriction was recommended in 71 (65\%) patients and initiation of dobutamine in 27 (25\%). Fluid prescription during the first 24 hours was significantly lower in LE patients (49 [33-74] vs 66 [42-100] mL/kg, P = .01), whereas 55\% more LE patients received dobutamine (22\% vs 12\%, P = .01). The LE patients had improved 28-day survival (66\% vs 56\%, P = .04), a reduction in stage 3 acute kidney injury (20\% vs 39\%), and more days alive and free of renal support (28 [9.7-28] vs 25 [5-28], P = .04). Conclusions: Limited echocardiography--guided management following early resuscitation is associated with improved survival, less fluid, and increased inotropic prescription. A prospective randomized control trial is required to verify these results.},

Thus, it could be argued that reversal of this change ({$\Delta$}SOFA) may reflect sepsis response and could be used as measure of efficacy in interventional trials. We aimed to assess the predictive performance of {$\Delta$}SOFA for 28-day mortality. Methods: Data from two previously published randomized controlled trials were studied: the first reporting on patients with severe Gram-negative infections as a derivation cohort and the second reporting on patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia as a validation cohort. Only patients with sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 definition were included in this analysis. SOFA scores were calculated on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 28. Results: We included 448 patients within the derivation cohort and 199 within the validation cohort. Mean SOFA scores on day 1 were 6.06 {\textpm} 4.07 and 7.84 {\textpm} 3.39, and 28 day mortality 22.8\% and 29.6\%, respectively. In the derivation cohort, the earliest time point where {$\Delta$}SOFA score predicted mortality was day 7 (AUROC (95\% CI) 0.84 (0.80--0.89); p {$<$} 0.001). The best tradeoff for prediction was found with 25\% changes (78\% sensitivity, 80\% specificity); less than 25\% decrease of admission SOFA was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio for death 14.87). This finding was confirmed in the validation cohort. Conclusions: {$\Delta$}SOFA on day 7 is a useful early prognostic marker of 28-day mortality and could serve as an endpoint in future sepsis trials alongside mortality.

The purpose of this study is to  consider the efficacy of Magill forceps for removal of safety pins from upper  esophagus. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted for all children  admitted to our hospital with safety pin ingestion from 1995 to 2003. In 58  children who had been found to ingest safety pin, the attachment site was  gastrointestinal tract. In 12 of the cases, safety pins were located in the upper  end of the esophagus. In seven of the children safety pin extraction was achieved  by using a Magill forceps with the assistance of a laryngoscope maintaining  general anesthesia with mask inhalation. RESULTS: Safety pins were successfully  removed with Magill forceps without any complications in seven patients whom they  were located in the upper esophagus. Upper esophageal safety pins in the other  five patients were extracted with rigid esophagoscopy for they were not seen  under direct laryngoscopy. There were no complications. CONCLUSIONS: This is a  preliminary report, but we believe that the Magill forceps technique for the  removal of safety pin in the upper end of the esophagus is safe and minimally  invasive method compared to rigid esophagoscopy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic procedures for foreign body ingestion (FBI) and esophageal food impactions (EFI) performed during on-call hours are associated  with increased stress, risk, and cost. We implemented a Foreign Body Algorithm  (FBA) designed to delay all but the most urgent endoscopy for EFI and FBI until  regular working hours. METHODS: Using endoscopy records from multiple academic  and community hospitals within a large integrated health system in the United  states, we identified esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) performed for food  impactions and foreign body ingestions occurring between May 2011 and February  2021. RESULTS: We identified 479 EGDs performed for FBI and EFI. The introduction  of the FBA was associated with a shorter length of stay (LOS) for overall cases  (0.35 vs. 0.8~d P {$<$}0.001), day cases (0.16 vs. 1.0~d P {$<$}0.001), and night cases  (0.40 vs. 0.6~d P =0.03). The introduction of the FBA did not change the rate of  overall adverse events (AE) or night AE. AE from the entire cohort was rare (3\%;  16 total). Of the AE, most were sedation related. The introduction of the FBA did  not affect the overall rate of night cases or AE, but the rate of after-hours  endoscopy for intentional ingestions decreased from 17.2\% to 3.1\% ( P =0.01).  CONCLUSION: This is one of the largest studies of esophageal impactions and  foreign bodies in adults in the United States, and the first to examine the  effects of a protocol designed to avoid after-hours endoscopy. These results  suggest that postponing after-hours EGD until the daytime is not associated with  adverse safety outcomes or increased LOS.},

  abstract = {Background: Rib fractures are identified in 10\% of all injury victims and are associated with significant morbidity (33\%) and mortality (12\%). Significant progress has been made in the management of rib fractures over the past few decades, including operative reduction and internal fixation (rib ORIF); however, the subset of patients that would benefit most from this procedure remains ill-defined. The aim of this project was to develop evidence-based recommendations. Methods: Population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions were formulated for patients with and without flail chest. Outcomes of interest included mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation (DMV), hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), incidence of pneumonia, need for tracheostomy, and pain control. A systematic review and meta-analysis of currently available evidence was performed per the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. Results: Twenty-two studies were identified and analyzed. These included 986 patients with flail chest, of whom 334 underwent rib ORIF. Rib ORIF afforded lower mortality; shorter DMV, hospital LOS, and ICU LOS; and lower incidence of pneumonia and need for tracheostomy. The data quality was deemed very low, with only three prospective randomized trials available. Analyses for pain in patients with flail chest and all outcomes in patients with nonflail chest were not feasible due to inadequate data. Conclusion: In adult patients with flail chest, we conditionally recommend rib ORIF to decrease mortality; shorten DMV, hospital LOS, and ICU LOS; and decrease incidence of pneumonia and need for tracheostomy. We cannot offer a recommendation for pain control, or any of the outcomes in patients with nonflail chest with currently available data.

The current study investigated whether a hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOC-201) could maintain organ viability during an exsanguinating liver injury and allow for prolonged survival. This hypothesis was tested in a large animal model that simulated blunt abdominal trauma with major organ injury. Methods: Swine underwent a liver crush, laceration and 50 ml/kg initial blood loss. The liver bled at 3 ml/kg per min during the resuscitation phase. No fluid (NF 0/6), hetastarch (HES 0/8), or HBOC-201 (HBOC 0/8) was given during the resuscitation phase. Swine alive 60 min after the initial injury underwent liver repair and 96 h observation. Results: All HBOC swine survived 60 min versus none of the NF or HES swine (P B/0.05). All HBOC swine survived 24 h and 7/8 survived 96 h with good functional recovery. Conclusions: HBOC resuscitation during liver bleeding in a swine model of hemorrhagic shock and liver injury allowed for 96 h survival.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The consensus definition of severe sepsis requires suspected or proven infection, organ failure, and signs that meet two or more criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). We aimed to test the sensitivity, face validity, and construct validity of this approach. METHODS We studied data from patients from 172 intensive care units in Australia and New Zealand from 2000 through 2013. We identified patients with infection and organ failure and categorized them according to whether they had signs meeting two or more SIRS criteria (SIRS-positive severe sepsis) or less than two SIRS criteria (SIRSnegative severe sepsis). We compared their characteristics and outcomes and assessed them for the presence of a step increase in the risk of death at a threshold of two SIRS criteria. RESULTS Of 1,171,797 patients, a total of 109,663 had infection and organ failure. Among these, 96,385 patients (87.9\%) had SIRS-positive severe sepsis and 13,278 (12.1\%) had SIRS-negative severe sepsis. Over a period of 14 years, these groups had similar characteristics and changes in mortality (SIRS-positive group: from 36.1\% [829 of 2296 patients] to 18.3\% [2037 of 11,119], P{$<$}0.001; SIRS-negative group: from 27.7\% [100 of 361] to 9.3\% [122 of 1315], P{$<$}0.001). Moreover, this pattern remained similar after adjustment for baseline characteristics (odds ratio in the SIRS-positive group, 0.96; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.96 to 0.97; odds ratio in the SIRSnegative group, 0.96; 95\% CI, 0.94 to 0.98; P\,=\,0.12 for between-group difference). In the adjusted analysis, mortality increased linearly with each additional SIRS criterion (odds ratio for each additional criterion, 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.11 to 1.15; P{$<$}0.001) without any transitional increase in risk at a threshold of two SIRS criteria.

  abstract = {Introduction: In adults with foreign body ingestion (i.e non-food objects), are usually secondary to psychiatric disorders, alcohol intoxications, and individuals seeking secondary gains. Studies suggest 80\% of these foreign bodies will pass without interventions and the mortality rate is under 0.1\%. Patients with recurrent foreign body ingestion and previous gastrointestinal tract surgeries are at higher risk of impactions, perforation, and obstruction. Sharp objects raise concern for perforation rates to 35\%, commonly at the ileocecal valve and less commonly at appendiceal lumen, cecal-ascending colon junction, colonic flexures, and rectosigmoid junction. Objects larger than 6 cm impose a risk for small bowel obstruction. There is limited evidence on the role of colonoscopy after the distal migration of foreign bodies into the ileum and colon. Case description/methods: A 53-year-old male presented with an intentional ingestion of 2 screws, 2 thumbtacks, and 1 razor head. He has a history of opioid abuse, borderline personality disorder, depression, and seven previous foreign body ingestion requiring three exploratory where he had resection of part of his stomach, small bowel, and colon. Three hours after ingestion of foreign bodies, he experienced abdominal pain and nausea and presented to the emergency department. The razer and thumbtacks were successfully removed via upper endoscopy. The screws had passed further in the small bowel. The patient was given bowel prep to increase the chance of passage of the retained screws. Serial KUB did show one screw excreted, however, the second screw did not move from the distal ileum. Repeat CT abdomen/pelvis did not show any perforation. The patient continued to have abdominal discomfort. Colonoscopy was performed with a cap. The screw was found at the ileocolic anastomosis, stuck in a fold with penetration of mucosa. It was removed with a snare. The patient's symptoms resolved. Discussion: In our case, the sharp foreign body was impacted at the ileocolonic anastomosis. Although most sharp-pointed objects in the stomach will pass without incident, the risk of a complication caused by a sharppointed object is as high as 35\%. Once Sharp-pointed things have migrated distally to the ligament of Treitz, daily radiographs should be done to document their passage. Serial abdominal exam, and surgical consultation are needed. Although the failure of a sharp object to pass through the ileocecal valve is an indication for surgery, endoscopic management can be tried first.},

  abstract = {Ingestion of foreign bodies is a common pediatric problem, with more than 100,000 cases occurring each year. The vast majority of pediatric ingestions are  accidental; increasing incidence of intentional ingestions starts in the  adolescent age group. In the United States, the most common pediatric foreign  bodies ingested are coins, followed by a variety of other objects, including  toys, toy parts, sharp objects, batteries, bones, and food. In adolescents and  adults, meat or food impactions are the most common accidental foreign body  ingestion. Esophageal pathology underlies most cases of food impaction.  Management of foreign body ingestions varies based on the object ingested, its  location, and the patient's age and size. Esophageal foreign bodies as a group  require early intervention because of their potential to cause respiratory  symptoms and complications, esophageal erosions, or even an aortoesophageal  fistula. Ingested batteries that lodge in the esophagus require urgent endoscopic  removal even in the asymptomatic patient due to the high risk of complications.  Sharp foreign bodies increase the foreign body complication rate from less than  1\% to 15\% to 35\%, except for straight pins, which usually follow a relatively  benign course unless multiple pins are ingested. Magnets are increasingly  ingested, due to their ubiquitous nature and the perception that they do not pose  a risk. Ingestion of multiple magnets creates a significant risk of obstruction,  perforation, and fistula development. Methods to deal with foreign bodies include  the suture technique, the double snare technique, and the combined forceps/snare  technique for long, large, and sharp foreign bodies, along with newer equipment,  such as retrieval nets and a variety of specialized forceps.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Eczema and food allergy are common health conditions that usually begin in early childhood and often occur in the same people. They can be associated with an impaired skin barrier in early infancy. It is unclear whether trying to prevent or reverse an impaired skin barrier soon after birth is effective for preventing eczema or food allergy. Objectives Primary objective To assess the effects of skin care interventions such as emollients for primary prevention of eczema and food allergy in infants. Secondary objective To identify features of study populations such as age, hereditary risk, and adherence to interventions that are associated with the greatest treatment benefit or harm for both eczema and food allergy. Search methods We performed an updated search of the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in September 2021. We searched two trials registers in July 2021. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and scanned conference proceedings to identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).  Selection criteria We included RCTs of skin care interventions that could potentially enhance skin barrier function, reduce dryness, or reduce subclinical inflammation in healthy term ({$>$} 37 weeks) infants ({$\leq$} 12 months) without pre-existing eczema, food allergy, or other skin condition. Eligible comparisons were standard care in the locality or no treatment. Types of skin care interventions could include moisturisers/emollients; bathing products; advice regarding reducing soap exposure and bathing frequency; and use of water softeners. No minimum follow-up was required. Data collection and analysis This is a prospective individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, and primary analyses used the IPD dataset. Primary outcomes were cumulative incidence of eczema and cumulative incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated food allergy by one to three years, both measured at the closest available time point to two years. Secondary outcomes included adverse events during the intervention period; eczema severity (clinician-assessed); parent report of eczema severity; time to onset of eczema; parent report of immediate food allergy; and allergic sensitisation to food or inhalant allergen. Main results We identified 33 RCTs comprising 25,827 participants. Of these, 17 studies randomising 5823 participants reported information on one or more outcomes specified in this review.  We included 11 studies, randomising 5217 participants, in one or more meta-analyses (range 2 to 9 studies per individual meta-analysis), with 10 of these studies providing IPD; the remaining 6 studies were included in the narrative results only.   Most studies were conducted at children's hospitals. Twenty-five studies, including all those contributing data to meta-analyses, randomised newborns up to age three weeks to receive a skin care intervention or standard infant skin care. Eight of the 11 studies contributing to meta-analyses recruited infants at high risk of developing eczema or food allergy, although the definition of high risk varied between studies. Durations of intervention and follow-up ranged from 24 hours to three years. All interventions were compared against no skin care intervention or local standard care. Of the 17 studies that reported information on our prespecified outcomes, 13 assessed emollients. We assessed most of the evidence in the review as low certainty and had some concerns about risk of bias. A rating of some concerns was most often due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors or significant missing data, which could have impacted outcome measurement but was judged unlikely to have done so. We assessed the evidence for the primary food allergy outcome as high risk of bias due to the inclusion of only one trial, where findings varied based on different assumptions about missing data. Skin care interventions during infancy probably do not change the risk of eczema by one to three years of age (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.31; risk difference 5 more cases per 1000 infants, 95\% CI 28 less to 47 more; moderate-certainty evidence; 3075 participants, 7 trials) or time to onset of eczema (hazard ratio 0.86, 95\% CI 0.65 to 1.14; moderate-certainty evidence; 3349 participants, 9 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may increase the risk of IgE-mediated food allergy by one to three years of age (RR 2.53, 95\% CI 0.99 to 6.49; low-certainty evidence; 976 participants, 1 trial) but may not change risk of allergic sensitisation to a food allergen by age one to three years (RR 1.05, 95\% CI 0.64 to 1.71; low-certainty evidence; 1794 participants, 3 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may slightly increase risk of parent report of immediate reaction to a common food allergen at two years (RR 1.27, 95\% CI 1.00 to 1.61; low-certainty evidence; 1171 participants, 1 trial); however, this was only seen for cow's milk, and may be unreliable due to over-reporting of milk allergy in infants. Skin care interventions during infancy probably increase risk of skin infection over the intervention period (RR 1.33, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.75; risk difference 17 more cases per 1000 infants, 95\% CI one more to 38 more; moderate-certainty evidence; 2728 participants, 6 trials) and may increase the risk of infant slippage over the intervention period (RR 1.42, 95\% CI 0.67 to 2.99; low-certainty evidence; 2538 participants, 4 trials) and stinging/allergic reactions to moisturisers (RR 2.24, 95\% 0.67 to 7.43; low-certainty evidence; 343 participants, 4 trials), although CIs for slippages and stinging/allergic reactions were wide and include the possibility of no effect or reduced risk. Preplanned subgroup analyses showed that the effects of interventions were not influenced by age, duration of intervention, hereditary risk, filaggrin ( FLG ) mutation, chromosome 11 intergenic variant rs2212434,   or classification of intervention type for risk of developing eczema. We could not evaluate these effects on risk of food allergy. Evidence was insufficient to show whether adherence to interventions influenced the relationship between skin care interventions and eczema or food allergy development. Authors' conclusions Based on low- to moderate-certainty evidence, skin care interventions such as emollients during the first year of life in healthy infants are probably not effective for preventing eczema; may increase risk of food allergy; and probably increase risk of skin infection. Further study is needed to understand whether different approaches to infant skin care might prevent eczema or food allergy. Plain language summary Skin care interventions for preventing eczema and food allergy Does moisturising baby skin prevent eczema or food allergies? Key messages Skin care treatments in babies, such as using moisturisers on the skin during the first year of life, probably do not prevent babies from developing eczema; may increase the chance of food allergy; and probably increase the chance of skin infection. This review looked at the prevention of eczema and food allergy only. Skin care treatments are still important to treat eczema.  What are allergies? An immune response is how the body recognises and defends itself against substances that appear harmful. An allergy is a reaction of the body's immune system to a particular food or substance (an allergen) that is usually harmless. Different allergies affect different parts of the body, and their effects can be mild or serious. Food allergies and eczema Eczema is a common skin condition  that causes dry, itchy, cracked skin. Eczema is common in children, often developing before their first birthday, and may be long-lasting. Allergies to food can cause itching in the mouth, a raised itchy red rash, swelling of the face, stomach symptoms, or difficulty breathing. They usually happen within two hours after a food is eaten. People with food allergies often have other allergic conditions, such as asthma, hay fever, and eczema. Why we did this Cochrane Review We wanted to learn how skin care affects the risk of a baby developing eczema or food allergies. Skin care treatments included: {$\bullet$} putting moisturisers on a baby's skin; {$\bullet$} bathing babies with water containing moisturisers or moisturising oils; {$\bullet$} advising parents to use less soap, or to bathe their child less often; {$\bullet$} using water softeners.  We also wanted to know if these skin care treatments cause any unwanted effects.  What did we do? We searched for studies of different types of skin care for healthy babies (aged up to one year) with no previous food allergy, eczema, or other skin condition. Search date:  we incorporated evidence published up to July 2021. We were interested in studies that reported: {$\bullet$} how many children developed eczema, or food allergy, by age one to three years; {$\bullet$} how severe the eczema was (according to a researcher and to parents); {$\bullet$} how long it took for eczema to develop; {$\bullet$} parents' reports of immediate (under two hours) reactions to a food allergen; {$\bullet$} how many children developed sensitivity to a particular food allergen; {$\bullet$} any unwanted effects. We assessed the strengths and weaknesses of each study to determine how reliable the results might be, and then combined the results of the relevant studies and looked at overall effects.   What we found We found 33 studies, involving 25,827 babies, that assessed any type of skin intervention. The included studies took place in Europe, Australia, Japan, and the USA, most often at children's hospitals. Skin care was compared against no skin care or usual skin care for babies in that country. Treatment and follow-up times ranged from 24 hours to three years. Many studies (13) tested the use of moisturisers; the other studies mainly tested the use of bathing and cleansing products and how often they were used. Of the 33 included studies, only 11 studies had comparable outcomes of eczema, food allergy, or adverse effects and were combined for analysis. All of these studies enrolled babies before they were one month old, and  eight of these studies included babies thought to be at high risk for developing eczema.  What are the main results of our review? Compared to no skin care or standard care, moisturisers: {$\bullet$} probably do not change the chance of developing eczema by age one to three years (7 studies; 3075 babies), or the time needed for eczema to develop (9 studies; 3349 babies); {$\bullet$} may increase the chance of developing a food allergy as judged by a researcher (1 study; 976 babies) by age one to three years; {$\bullet$} may slightly increase the number of immediate reactions to a common food allergen at two years, as reported by parents (1 study; 1171 babies); {$\bullet$} probably cause more skin infections (6 studies; 2728 babies); {$\bullet$} may increase unwanted effects, such as a stinging feeling or an allergic reaction to moisturisers (4 studies; 343 babies); {$\bullet$} may increase the chance of babies slipping (4 studies; 2538 babies); {$\bullet$} may not affect the chance of developing sensitivity to food allergens (3 studies; 1797 babies) by age one to three years. Confidence in our results We are moderately confident in our results for developing eczema and the time needed to develop eczema. We are less confident about our results for food allergy or sensitivity, which are based on small numbers of studies with widely varying results. These results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. Our confidence in the review findings for skin infections is moderate, but low for stinging or allergic reactions and slipping.},

  abstract = {Early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) consists of early, aggressive fluid resuscitation and is known to improve survival in sepsis. It is unknown how often EGDT leads to subsequent fluid overload and whether post-EGDT fluid overload affects patients' outcomes. Our hypothesis was that patients with sepsis treated with EGDT were at risk for fluid overload and that fluid overload would be associated with adverse outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort of 405 consecutive patients admitted with severe sepsis and septic shock to the medical intensive care unit of a tertiary care academic hospital from January 2008 to December 2009. Baseline demographics, daily weights, fluid status, clinical or radiographic evidence of fluid overload, and medical interventions (thoracentesis, paracentesis, diuretic use, and ultrafiltration) were abstracted, and associations explored using univariate and multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses. At day 1, 67\% of patients developed evidence of fluid overload, and in 48\%, fluid overload persisted to day 3. Interrater agreement for presence of fluid overload was substantial (. = 0.7). An increased trend in weight was noted in those with persistent clinical and radiologic evidence of fluid overload, but not with recorded positive fluid balance. When adjusted for baseline severity of illness, fluid overload was associated with increased use of fluid-related medical interventions (thoracentesis and diuretics) and hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.92; confidence interval, 1.16Y3.22). In patients with severe sepsis and septic shock treated with EGDT, clinical evidence of persistent fluid overload is common and is associated with increased use of medical interventions and hospital mortality.},

METHODS: Patients admitted with ingested  foreign bodies were identified in the Kids' Inpatient Database (1997-2009).  RESULTS: Overall, 7480 cases were identified. Patients were most commonly {$<$}5years  of age (44\%), male (54\%), and Caucasian (57\%). A total of 2506 procedures were  performed, GI surgical procedures (57\%) most frequently, followed by GI endoscopy  (24\%), esophagoscopy (11\%), and bronchoscopy - in cases of inhaled objects (9\%).  On multivariate analysis, length of stay increased when cases were associated  with intestinal obstruction (OR=1.7), esophageal perforation (OR=40.0),  intestinal perforation (OR=4.4), exploratory laparotomy (OR=1.9), and gastric  (OR=2.9), small bowel (OR=1.5), or colon surgery (OR=2.5), all p{$<$}0.02.

CONCLUSIONS: Surgical or endoscopic  procedures are performed in approximately one third of GIFB cases. Associated  psychiatric disorder or self-inflicted injury is seen in more than 20\% of GIFB  patients. Resource utilization is determined heavily by associated diagnoses and  treatment procedures.},

Study selection Randomised controlled trials comparing tranexamic acid with no tranexamic acid or placebo in surgical patients. Outcome measures of interest were the number of patients receiving a blood transfusion; the number of patients with a thromboembolic event (myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism); and the number of deaths. Trials were included irrespective of language or publication status. Results 129 trials, totalling 10 488 patients, carried out between 1972 and 2011 were included. Tranexamic acid reduced the probability of receiving a blood transfusion by a third (risk ratio 0.62, 95\% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.65; P{$<$}0.001).

Ambulances need aids to recognise these patients and aim for target saturations using controlled oxygen. The British Thoracic Society recommends identifying patients with T2RF using tools like an electronic oxygen alert. The ambulance service for Royal Blackburn Hospital (RBH) does not have an electronic alert system. The aim of this audit is to compare paramedics' recognition of patients with known T2RF before and after creating an electronic oxygen alert. Method: This prospective audit from January-April 2014 at RBH included inpatients with known T2RF who received high flow oxygen in the ambulance, as documented on the ambulance sheet and first arterial blood gas. On discharge, an electronic oxygen alert was set up for each patient. We assessed if ambulance records noted the patient as having previous T2RF on readmission. Results: 27 patients met inclusion criteria. The data before the creation of an electronic alert showed ambulances identified 41\% as having COPD or T2RF. Of these 27 patients, 70\% received uncontrolled high flow oxygen in the ambulance and only 4\% had documented target saturations on the ambulance sheet. NIV was required for 67\% with a mortality of 22\% in this group. Of the 27 patients, 22\% were readmitted and noted to have known T2RF by paramedics via the electronic alert. Half of those readmitted received uncontrolled oxygen. Target saturations for 83\% were not recorded. Conclusion: Identifying T2RF patients by ambulances improved with using electronic oxygen alerts, however additional training for paramedics on oxygen administration in such patients is required.},

This study was designed to assess the association between 30 mL/kg crystalloids and intubation in patients with sepsis or septic shock and heart failure, end-stage renal disease, or cirrhosis. METHODS: This propensity score-matched retrospective cohort study included patients with sepsis or septic shock admitted to a large medical ICU. Primary exposure was IV fluid volume in the first 6 h following sepsis diagnosis, divided into two cohorts: \$ 30 mL/kg (standard group) and {$<$} 30 mL/kg (restricted group). The primary outcome was need for mechanical ventilation within 72 h following initiation of fluid resuscitation. Secondary outcomes were length of stay, ventilator days, and time to intubation. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients were included, with 104 (50\%) in the restricted group ({$<$} 30 mL/kg) and 104 in the standard group (\$ 30 mL/kg). No difference in intubation incidence was detected between the two groups, with 36 patients (35\%) in the restricted group and 33 (32\%) in the standard group (adjusted OR, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.41-1.36; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .34) intubated.

  abstract = {Background Pulmonary-vein isolation is increasingly being used to treat atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure. Methods In this prospective, multicenter clinical trial, we randomly assigned patients with symptomatic, drug-resistant atrial fibrillation, an ejection fraction of 40\% or less, and New York Heart Association class II or III heart failure to undergo either pulmonary-vein isolation or atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing. All patients completed the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (scores range from 0 to 105, with a higher score indicating a worse quality of life) and underwent echocardiography and a 6-minute walk test (the composite primary end point). Over a 6-month period, patients were monitored for both symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation. Results In all, 41 patients underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, and 40 underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing; none were lost to follow-up at 6 months. The composite primary end point favored the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, with an improved questionnaire score at 6 months (60, vs. 82 in the group that underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing; P{$<$}0.001), a longer 6-minute-walk distance (340 m vs. 297 m, P{$<$}0.001), and a higher ejection fraction (35\% vs. 28\%, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). In the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, 88\% of patients receiving antiarrhythmic drugs and 71\% of those not receiving such drugs were free of atrial fibrillation at 6 months. In the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, pulmonary-vein stenosis developed in two patients, pericardial effusion in one, and pulmonary edema in another; in the group that underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing, lead dislodgment was found in one patient and pneumothorax in another. Conclusions Pulmonary-vein isolation was superior to atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing in patients with heart failure who had drug-refractory atrial fibrillation.

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this report is to describe our experience in management of aortoesophageal fistulas (AEF) with special emphasis on the value of in situ aortic allograft replacement. Patients: Nine patients presenting with AEF were observed between May 1988 and April 2002. There were 4 men and 5 women with a mean age of 54.3 years (range, 32-77 years). Six patients presented secondary AEF after aortic repair. Two patients presented primary AEF after rupture of an atherosclerotic aneurysm into the esophagus. In the remaining patient, AEF was caused by swallowing a fishbone. In 6 cases involving true AEF with a direct communication between the aorta and esophagus, massive exsanguinating hematemesis occurred. It was usually preceded by minor sentinel bleeding, Two patients presented esophagoparaprosthetic fistula (EPPF). One patient presented primary AEF that was contained by a large thrombus in the communication. The clinical picture in these 3 patients involved severe sepsis without hemorrhage. Results: Two patients died as a result of massive hemorrhage before assessment and surgical treatment could be undertaken. One 77-year-old woman presenting EPPF refused to undergo surgery and died because of infection. The remaining 6 patients underwent surgical treatment with various outcomes. One man died during thoracotomy caused by exsanguinating hemorrhage. One woman presenting EPPF was treated by exclusion followed by ascending aorta to abdominal aorta bypass grafting, removal of the prosthesis, esophageal exclusion, and directed esophageal fistula. She died of infection. The other 4 patients were treated by in situ aortic allograft replacement. The damaged esophagus was repaired by using the Tha1 technique in 1 patient. In the remaining 3 cases subtotal esophagectomy was performed in association with cervical esophagostomy, ligation of the abdominal esophagus, gastrostomy, and jejunostomy. One patient died of sepsis during the first 24 hours after the operation. The other 3 patients underwent secondary esophagoplasty and survived with no further sign of infection. Mean duration of follow-up in the survivor group was 53 months (range, 15-95 months). Overall 6 patients, including 3 that did not undergo surgical treatment, died and 3 patients survived. Conclusion: Our experience confirms that AEF is a rare but catastrophic disorder. In situ allograft replacement usually in association with subtotal esophagectomy appears to be an excellent salvage modality whenever emergency surgery is feasible.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article was to evaluate the usefulness of ultralow-dose chest CT as an initial imaging study for evaluation of sharp fish bone esophageal foreign body (FB). MATERIALS AND METHODS. A total of 57 subjects who underwent ultralow-dose chest CT were included in this retrospective study. All subjects had a history of ingestion and symptoms of esophageal FB. All ultralow-dose chest CT data were reconstructed twice, once with filtered back projection (FBP) and once with iterative reconstruction, and three observers reviewed the images independently. ROC analysis was used to evaluate diagnostic performance of ultralow-dose chest CT. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for analysis of interobserver agreement. RESULTS. Among 57 patients, 42 were confirmed as having esophageal FB. Significant objective noise reduction of mediastinum was achieved using an iterative reconstruction technique. Subjective image noise of iterative reconstruction was significantly better than that of FBP. Overall diagnostic performance of ultralow-dose chest CT for esophageal FB of iterative reconstruction (AUC = 0.999) was significantly better than that of FBP (AUC = 0.95) (p = 0.02). Interobserver agreement was greater for iterative reconstruction (ICC = 0.944) than for FBP (ICC = 0.778). CONCLUSION. Ultralow-dose chest CT using iterative reconstruction provided satisfactory diagnostic image quality for identifying fish bone esophageal FB with reduced radiation dose and high observer accuracy. Therefore, ultralow-dose chest CT would be adequate as a first-line imaging modality for fish bone esophageal FB.},

With written informed consent, children scheduled for cardiac catheterisation under intravenous ketamine anaesthesia and their mothers (n = 46) were randomly assigned to either the mother-voice (MV) or control group. While the MV group (n = 23) listened via headphones to a recording of their mothers' voices during the perioperative period, the control group (n = 23) wore headphones with no auditory stimulation. Ketamine requirements and haemodynamics were recorded. Anxiety of the patients and the parents were measured before and after the procedure with the modified Yale preoperative anxiety scale and Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, respectively. Emergence agitation was graded. The demographic and haemodynamic data were comparable, except for a longer procedure time in the MV group. Mothers' State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was not different preoperatively between the groups. Mothers' state and trait anxiety was lower after the procedure in the MV group compared with the preoperative values. In the control group only maternal state anxiety was diminished after the procedure. There was no significant group difference with respect to ketamine requirement (5.1 +/- 1.9 mg vs 4.9 +/- 1.6 mg, P = 0.645). The anxiety score of children was lower in the MV group before the procedure (modified Yale preoperative anxiety scale score 35 +/- 12 vs 28 +/- 9, P = 0.038), but there was no significant difference postoperatively. Emergence agitation was attenuated in the MV group (P = 0.005).},

In this study, aspiration of screwdriver  and healing abutment is reported with literature review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A  26-year-old male patient was referred from a local dental clinic with the  suspicion of ingestion of a screwdriver and healing abutment during the  second-stage surgery. The patient reported symptoms including dyspnea, cough, and  foreign body sensation. On the chest radiograph, a radiopaque foreign body  resembling the screwdriver and healing abutment was observed at the right mid  lung. RESULTS: Bronchoscopic examination using flexible cable was performed under  conscious sedation, and microforceps were used to remove the instruments.  Aspirated screwdriver and healing abutment were removed safely under intravenous  sedation. The patient did not have any symptoms associated with lung aspiration  after removal of the foreign body during follow-up periods. CONCLUSION:  Bronchoscopic removal is the most recommended procedure for removal of the  aspirated foreign body. This can be performed under conscious sedation.  Precautions, such as tethering the screwdriver, are recommended during implant  procedures.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Emergency tracheal intubation has achieved high success and low complication rates in the emergency department (ED). The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of post-intubation CA and determine the clinical factors associated with this complication. Methods: A matched case-control study with a case to control ratio of 1:3 was conducted at an urban tertiary care center between January 2007 and December 2011. Critically ill adult patients requiring emergency airway management in the ED were included. The primary endpoint was post-intubation CA, defined as CA within 10 minutes after tracheal intubation. Clinical variables were compared between patients with post-intubation CA and patients without CA who were individually matched based on age, sex, and pre-existing comorbidities. Results: Of 2,403 patients who underwent emergency tracheal intubation, 41 patients (1.7\%) had a post-intubation CA within 10 minutes of the procedure. The most common initial rhythm was pulseless electrical activity (78.1\%). Patients experiencing CA had higher in-hospital mortality than patients without CA (61.0\% vs. 30.1\%; p,0.001). Systolic hypotension prior to intubation, defined as a systolic blood pressure \#90 mmHg, was independently associated with post-intubation CA (OR, 3.67 [95\% CI, 1.58--8.55], p = 0.01). Conclusion: Early post-intubation CA occurred with an approximate 2\% frequency in the ED. Systolic hypotension before intubation is associated with this complication, which has potentially significant implications for clinicians at the time of intubation.},

Results: Of 84,554 children, 873 (1.03\%) had PCSI. Patients {$<$} 4 years were less likely to have PCSI (0.68\% vs. 1.1\%, RR 0.59, p {$<$} 0.001). 165 children (0.20\%) required an intervention for PCSI. 12.8\% of all children were screened for PCSI with imaging, 9.3\% with CT, and 3.2\% with plain X-rays. In spite of similar injury and intervention rates, stand-alone pediatric trauma centers were less likely than others to image patients without PCSI (11\% vs. 13\% p {$<$} 0.001), less likely to utilize CT scan (5.8\% vs. 10.6\% p {$<$} 0.001) and more likely to utilize plain films (5.2\% vs. 2.4\% p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion: Despite exceedingly low rates of PSCI requiring intervention (0.2\%), imaging rates for screening are significant. Stand-alone pediatric trauma centers outperform others in limiting unnecessary imaging. Level of evidence: IV.},

The purpose of this study is to utilize a comprehensive database to  describe the epidemiology of pediatric injuries at a tertiary hospital in Malawi.  METHODS: Data were prospectively collected on patients presenting to the  emergency department for treatment of injuries from 2008 to 2010 (n = 23,625).  The subset of pediatric patients (n = 7233) underwent cross-sectional analysis to  examine demographics, injury environment, timing and mechanisms. RESULTS:  Pediatric patients, (0-16 years) comprised 30.6\% of all trauma patients. Mean age  was 7.2 years. Falls were the most common injury (43\%), followed by burns  (11.1\%), pedestrian road traffic injuries (9.7\%), foreign bodies (7.5\%), and  assaults (7.2\%). Statistically significant differences in injury pattern were  observed between gender, age groups and season. After logistic regression,  predictors of fall included male gender, home setting, and rainy season, whereas  predictors of burn included female gender, age 0-5 yrs, home setting, and cold  season. Predictors of pedestrian injury included age 6-10 yrs, female, and  roadside setting. Predictors of foreign body ingestion included age 0-5 yrs,  female gender, home setting, and daytime, and predictors of assault include male  gender, age 11-16 yrs, nighttime hours. All predictors were statistically  significant (p {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed patterns of injury based  upon age, gender, location, and season. Our results may prove useful to  stakeholders in injury prevention for designing, evaluating, and implementing  programs to improve public safety in children in Malawi and similar resource poor  nations.},

  abstract = {Background---Little is known about the nationwide trend in the survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in Japan and the differences in incidence and survival by age group and origin of arrest. Methods and Results---A nationwide, prospective, population-based observation covering the whole population of Japan and involving consecutive OHCA patients with resuscitation attempts was conducted from January 2005 to December 2009. The main outcome measure was 1-month survival with favorable neurological outcome. The nationwide trends in OHCA incidence and outcome by age and origin of arrest were assessed. Multiple logistic regression analysis for bystander-witnessed OHCA was used to adjust for factors that were potentially associated with favorable neurological outcome. During 5 years, 547 153 overall OHCAs and 169 360 bystander-witnessed OHCAs were enrolled. The annual incidence significantly increased among overall OHCAs and bystander-witnessed OHCAs. Neurologically favorable survival significantly increased from 1.6\% (1676/102 737) in 2005 to 2.8\% (3280/115 250) in 2009 (PϽ0.001), from 2.1\% (638/30 556) to 4.3\% (1558/36 361) (PϽ0.001), and from 9.8\% (437/4461) to 20.6\% (1215/5906) (PϽ0.001) among overall OHCA, bystander-witnessed OHCA, and bystander-witnessed ventricular fibrillation OHCA, respectively. Public-access automated external defibrillator use, either bystander-initiated chest compression-- only cardiopulmonary resuscitation or conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and earlier emergency medical services response time were associated with a better neurological outcome. Favorable neurological outcome among adult OHCA subjects significantly improved, but the outcome among younger children and very elderly subjects did not improve and was poor irrespective of origin of OHCA. Conclusions---Nationwide improvements of favorable neurological outcome from OHCA were observed in Japan and differed by age group and origin of OHCA. (Circulation. 2012;126:2834-2843.)},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Early defibrillation plays a key role in improving survival in patients with out-ofhospital cardiac arrests due to ventricular fibrillation (ventricular-fibrillation cardiac arrests), and the use of publicly accessible automated external defibrillators (AEDs) can help to reduce the time to defibrillation for such patients. However, the effect of dissemination of public-access AEDs for ventricular-fibrillation cardiac arrest at the population level has not been extensively investigated. METHODS From a nationwide, prospective, population-based registry of patients with out-ofhospital cardiac arrest in Japan, we identified patients from 2005 through 2013 with bystander-witnessed ventricular-fibrillation arrests of presumed cardiac origin in whom resuscitation was attempted. The primary outcome measure was survival at 1 month with a favorable neurologic outcome (Cerebral Performance Category of 1 or 2, on a scale from 1 [good cerebral performance] to 5 [death or brain death]). The number of patients in whom survival with a favorable neurologic outcome was attributable to public-access defibrillation was estimated. RESULTS Of 43,762 patients with bystander-witnessed ventricular-fibrillation arrests of cardiac origin, 4499 (10.3\%) received public-access defibrillation. The percentage of patients receiving public-access defibrillation increased from 1.1\% in 2005 to 16.5\% in 2013 (P{$<$}0.001 for trend). The percentage of patients who were alive at 1 month with a favorable neurologic outcome was significantly higher with public-access defibrillation than without public-access defibrillation (38.5\% vs. 18.2\%; adjusted odds ratio after propensity-score matching, 1.99; 95\% confidence interval, 1.80 to 2.19). The estimated number of survivors in whom survival with a favorable neurologic outcome was attributed to public-access defibrillation increased from 6 in 2005 to 201 in 2013 (P{$<$}0.001 for trend).

  abstract = {Background/Aim: Appendicitis and its complications remain a common problem affecting patients of all age groups. Foreign bodies are a rare cause of appendicitis. We tried to define potentially dangerous foreign bodies that may cause appendicitis and summarize general guidelines for their clinical management. Methods: A 100-year literature review including 256 cases of ingested foreign bodies within the appendix with emphasis on: (1) objects that are more prone to cause appendicitis or appendiceal perforation; (2) foreign bodies that are radiopaque and may be detected during follow-up with plain abdominal films, and (3) guidelines for clinical management. Results: Complications usually occur with sharp, thin, stiff, pointed and long objects. The majority of these objects are radiopaque. An immediate attempt should be made to remove a risky object by gastroscopy. If this fails, clinical follow-up with serial abdominal radiographs should be obtained. If the anatomical position of the object appears not to change and, most commonly, remains in the right lower abdominal quadrant, an attempt at colonoscopic removal is indicated. If this is unsuccessful, laparoscopic exploration with fluoroscopic guidance should be carried out to localize and remove the objects either by ileotomy, colotomy, or by appendectomy. Conclusion: Foreign bodies causing appendicitis are rare. However, if stiff or pointed objects get into the appendiceal lumen they have a high risk for appendicitis or perforation. These foreign bodies are almost always radiopaque.},

  abstract = {Objective: Recent studies suggest that hypotension thresholds in current guidelines might be too low for older patients due to arterial stiffening, possibly leading to insufficient fluid resuscitation. We compared intravenous (IV) fluid volumes that older ({$\geq$} 70 years) and younger ({$<$} 70 years) patients with suspected infection with similar initial systolic blood pressure (SBP) received in the emergency department (ED) and investigated whether this was associated with in-hospital mortality in older patients. Methods: This was an observational multicenter study using an existing database in which consecutive ED patients hospitalized with suspected infection were prospectively included. We first compared the fluid volumes older and younger ED patients received per initial SBP category. Patients were then stratified into two SBP categories ({$\leq$} or {$>$} 120 mmHg; 120 has been suggested to be a better threshold) and thereafter into three fluid volume categories: 0--1 L, 1--2 L, or {$>$} 2 L. In each SBP and fluid category, case-mix-adjusted in-hospital mortality was compared between older and younger patients, using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: The included 981 (37\%) older and 1678 (63\%) younger ED patients received similar IV fluid volumes per initial SBP category. Older patients with an initial SBP {$>$} 120 mmHg had a higher adjusted OR of 2.06 (95\% CI 1.02--4. 16), in the 0--1 L category, while this association was not found in the higher fluid categories of 1--2 L or {$>$} 2 L. In the SBP {$\leq$} 120 mmHg category, this association was also absent. Conclusion: This hypothesis-generating study suggests that older patients with suspected infection may need higher fluid volumes than younger patients, when having a seemingly normal initial SBP.},

Most recent Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines now recommend using capnography to ascertain the effectiveness of chest compressions and duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Based on an extensive review of available published literature, we selected all available peer-reviewed research investigations and case reports. Available evidence suggests that there is significant correlation between partial pressure of end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) and cardiac output that can indicate the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Additional evidence favoring the use of capnography during CPR includes definitive proof of correct placement of the endotracheal tube and possible prediction of patient survival following cardiac arrest, although the latter will require further investigations. There is emerging evidence that PETCO2 values can guide the initiation of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in refractory cardiac arrest (RCA). There is also increasing recognition of the value of capnography in intensive care settings in intubated patients. Future directions include determining the outcomes based on capnography waveforms PETCO2 values and determining a reasonable duration of CPR. In the future, given increasing use of capnography during CPR large databases can be analyzed to predict outcomes.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To study the effect of penile constriction devices used on a large series of patients who presented at our emergency facility. We explored treatment  options to prevent a wide range of vascular and mechanical injuries occurring due  to penile entrapment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2001 and March 2016,  26 patients with penile entrapment were admitted to our facility and  prospectively evaluated. RESULTS: The time that elapsed from penile constrictor  application to hospital admission varied from 10 hours to 6 weeks (mean: 22.8  hours). Non-metallic devices were used by 18 patients (66.6\%) while the other  nine (33.4\%) had used metallic objects. Acute urinary retention was present in  six (23\%) patients, of whom four (66.6\%) underwent percutaneous surgical  cystotomy and two (33.4\%) underwent simple bladder catheterization. The main  reason for penile constrictor placement was erectile dysfunction, accounting for  15 (55.5\%) cases. Autoerotic intention, psychiatric disorders, and sexual  violence were responsible in five (18.5\%), five (18.5\%), and two (7.4\%) cases,  respectively. The mean hospital stay was 18 hours (range, 6 hours to 3 weeks).  CONCLUSION: Penile strangulation treatment must be immediate through the  extraction of the foreign body, avoiding vascular impairments that can lead to  serious complications. Most patients present with low-grade injuries and use  penile constrictors due to erectile dysfunction. Removal of constrictor device  can be challenging. The use of specific tools for achieving penile release from  constrictors is a fast, safe and effective method. Patients with urinary  retention may require urinary diversion.},

Results and data were double-screened and extracted independently. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate effect sizes as standardized mean differences (MDs). Heterogeneity was investigated in subgroup analyses and metaregression analyses. The review was registered in the PROSPERO database as CRD42016024921.Ninety-two RCTs (7385 patients) were included in the systematic review, of which 81 were included in the meta-analysis. Music interventions significantly decreased anxiety (MD --0{$\cdot$}69, 95 per cent c.i. --0{$\cdot$}88 to --0{$\cdot$}50; P \&lt; 0{$\cdot$}001) and pain (MD --0{$\cdot$}50, --0{$\cdot$}66 to --0{$\cdot$}34; P \&lt; 0{$\cdot$}001) compared with controls, equivalent to a decrease of 21 mm for anxiety and 10 mm for pain on a 100-mm visual analogue scale. Changes in outcome corrected for baseline were even larger: MD --1{$\cdot$}41 (--1{$\cdot$}89 to --0{$\cdot$}94; P \&lt; 0{$\cdot$}001) for anxiety and --0{$\cdot$}54 (--0{$\cdot$}93 to --0{$\cdot$}15; P = 0{$\cdot$}006) for pain. Music interventions provided during general anaesthesia significantly decreased pain compared with that in controls (MD --0{$\cdot$}41, --0{$\cdot$}64 to --0{$\cdot$}18; P \&lt; 0{$\cdot$}001). Metaregression analysis found no significant association between the effect of music interventions and age, sex, choice and timing of music, and type of anaesthesia.

Work-up revealed copper deficiency (copper level of {$<$}0.05 microg/ml) and elevated zinc levels (280 microg/ml). The zinc toxicity was produced by the zinc content in the coins ingested by the patient over a period of many years. He was initially treated with -acetylcysteine and sodium bicarbonate followed by intravenous copper sulfate. He was also placed on Adolph's meat tenderizer and pancreatin thrice a day orally to loosen the massive amount of metallic objects including coins in his bowel and allow them to pass out in his feces. He was also continued on oral copper sulfate. His copper levels began to rise and reached a maximum of 0.72 microg/ml, and his zinc level fell to 153 microg/ml. However, as he refused surgery to remove the metal objects from his bowel and continued to ingest more coins, there was continued absorption of zinc, which later overcame the efforts to reduce the zinc level and increase copper levels in his blood. He finally succumbed to sepsis and multiorgan failure. Autopsy revealed a coin mass in the stomach weighing 1,870 grams in addition to a sigmoid volvulus caused by another coin bezoar in the colon.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Bezoars are collections of indigestible foreign material that are found within the gastrointestinal tract. Nonoperative  approaches such as dietary therapy, enzymatic dissolution, and endoscopic removal  have been regarded as the mainstays of therapy. The purpose of this paper is to  determine the efficacy of electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) as an alternative  form of treatment of gastric bezoars. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 1988 and  May 1996, 11 patients with large gastric bezoars, defined as those greater than 5  cm in diameter, received endoscopic-guided fragmentation using electrohydraulic  lithotripsy. Nine of our patients had a history of ingestion of "Pho Pu Zi",  (Cordia dichotoma Frost. f.), one of orange pitch, and one of ingestion of  persimmon. RESULTS: The 11 patients in the study underwent EHL for the treatment  of their gastric bezoars, with a 100\% success rate, which was defined as the lack  of residual bezoar seen on post-procedure barium study or endoscopy done 2 days  after the procedure. Patients were followed-up clinically for 30-68 months, with  seven of the 11 patients undergoing a barium study with no residual bezoar noted.  No procedure-related complications were seen, except for pharyngeal pain which  was most probably secondary to the placement of the silicon overtube.  CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopically guided electrohydraulic lithotripsy is a safe, highly  effective, alternative nonsurgical technique for the treatment of gastric  bezoars.},

Methods: We searched 6 electronic databases, reviewed reference lists of included studies, and contacted content experts to identify articles for review. Studies that derived or validated clinical decision rules in ED syncope patients were included. Two reviewers independently screened records for relevance, selected studies for inclusion, assessed study quality, and abstracted data. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool diagnostic performance estimates across studies that derived or validated the same clinical decision rule. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic, and subgroup hypotheses were tested with a test of interaction. Results: We identified 18 eligible studies. Deficiencies in outcome (blinding) and interrater reliability assessment were the most common methodological weaknesses. Meta-analysis of the San Francisco Syncope Rule (sensitivity 86\% [95\% confidence interval \{CI\} 83\% to 89\%]; specificity 49\% [95\% CI 48\% to 51\%]) and the Osservatorio Epidemiologico sulla Sincope nel Lazio risk score (sensitivity 95\% [95\% CI 88\% to 98\%]; specificity 31\% [95\% CI 29\% to 34\%]). Subgroup analysis identified study design (prospective, diagnostic odds ratio 8.82 [95\% CI 3.5 to 22] versus retrospective, diagnostic odds ratio 2.45 [95\% CI 0.96 to 6.21]) and ECG determination (by evaluating physician, diagnostic odds ratio 25.5 [95\% CI 4.41 to 148] versus researcher or cardiologist, diagnostic odds ratio 4 [95\% CI 2.15 to 7.55]) as potential explanations for the variability in San Francisco Syncope Rule performance. Conclusion: The methodological quality and prognostic accuracy of clinical decision rules for syncope are limited. Differences in study design and ECG interpretation may account for the variable prognostic performance of the San Francisco Syncope Rule when validated in different practice settings. {\copyright} 2010 American College of Emergency Physicians.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Diphenhydramine is a widely used first-generation histamine (H(1)) antagonist that can be obtained without prescription in many countries. Massive  ingestions can result in severe toxicity and even death. We describe a case of  diphenhydramine overdose leading to cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation  (CPR), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) cannulation for refractory  ventricular fibrillation, a process we refer to as extracorporeal cardiopulmonary  resuscitation (ECPR). CASE REPORT: Responding to a call for altered mental  status, emergency medical service (EMS) personnel found an unconscious and  seizing 17-year-old male. He had reportedly developed generalized tonic-clonic  seizures and dysrhythmias after ingesting approximately 800 25-mg diphenhydramine  tablets. He was transferred to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) after  stabilization at a local emergency center. After approximately 7~hours of  clinical stability and normalization of cardiac rhythm, electrolytes, and  acidosis, he developed renewed seizure activity and accelerated ventricular  rhythm leading to hemodynamic collapse and cardiac arrest. He was cannulated for  veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VAECMO) with CPR in progress.  A pharmacobezoar located in his stomach was presumed to be the cause of his  biphasic clinical deterioration. After 5~days, the patient was successfully  weaned from ECMO support. Ten days later, his convalescence continued in the  step-down unit and was discharged with good functional outcome. DISCUSSION:  Significant ingestion of anticholinergic substances is often fatal. This case  describes a favorable outcome after ECPR and aggressive supportive management  following a large intentional overdose of diphenhydramine.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) usually present with dysphonia, but can also be breathless and have problems with their swallowing. Speech and language therapy forms the initial mainstay of management in cases of UVFP, since up to 60\% of cases will resolve spontaneously. If vocal fold paralysis persists surgery, in the form of injection medialisation, has been shown to be an effective intervention. What is currently unclear is which is the most effective material available for injection. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of alternative injection materials in the treatment of UVFP. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 23 March 2012. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of injectable materials in patients with UVFP. The outcomes of interest were patient and clinician-reported improvement, and adverse events. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies from the search results and extracted data. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess study quality. Main results We identified no RCTs which met the inclusion criteria for this review. We excluded 18 studies on methodological grounds: 16 non-randomised studies; one RCT due to inadequate randomisation and inclusion of non-UVFP patients; and one RCT which compared two different particle sizes of the same injectable material. Authors' conclusions There is currently insufficient high-quality evidence for, or against, specific injectable materials for patients with UVFP. Future RCTs should aim to provide a direct comparison of the alternative materials currently available for injection medialisation. Plain language summary Alternative materials injected into the vocal fold (cord) for unilateral vocal fold paralysis Paralysis of one of the vocal folds (vocal cords) can have a significant impact upon a patient's quality of life. The affected patient may suffer with poor voice, breathlessness and problems with their swallowing. The treatment options include voice therapy, injection to the vocal cord or open surgery. The injection of a material into the affected vocal fold aims to improve voice, breathlessness and prevent episodes of aspiration (choking). There are a wide variety of injectable materials available and this review aimed to assess their effectiveness. Our systematic review of the relevant literature could not identify any randomised controlled trials of sufficient quality to include in this review. There is currently insufficient high-quality evidence to support the effectiveness of any particular injectable material. Further, well-designed, robust research is required in this area.},

  abstract = {Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide and takes many forms, which include hanging, jumping from a height, sharp force trauma, ingestion/poisoning, drowning, and firearm injuries. Self-harm and suicide are associated with particular injuries and patterns of injury. Many of these patterns are apparent on imaging. Self-harm or suicidal intent may be overlooked initially in such cases, particularly when the patient is unconscious or uncooperative. Correct identification of these findings by the radiologist will allow a patient's management to be tailored accordingly and may prevent future suicide attempts. The initial role of the radiologists in these cases is to identify life-threatening injuries that require urgent medical attention. The radiologist can add value by drawing attention to associated injuries, which may have been missed on initial clinical assessment. In many cases of self-harm and suicide, imaging is more reliable than clinical assessment. The radiologist may be able to provide important prognostic information that allows clinicians to manage expectations and plan appropriately. Furthermore, some imaging studies will provide essential forensic information. Unfortunately, many cases of attempted suicide will end in brain death. The radiologist may have a role in these cases in identifying evidence of hypoxic--ischaemic brain injury, confirming a diagnosis of brain death through judicious use of ancillary tests and, finally, in donor screening for organ transplantation. A review is presented to illustrate the imaging features of self-harm, suicide, and brain death, and to highlight the important role of the radiologist in these cases. {\copyright} 2024 The Royal College of Radiologists},

A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane library for articles published in Eng-lish between January 1, 2000 and October 25, 2019. The search terms used were related to cannabis and CBD in adults. We identified 25 studies (927 patients; 538 men and 389 women), of which 22 studies were controlled clinical trials (833 patients) and three were observational designs (94 patients) from five countries. Formulations, dose and dosage schemes varied significantly between studies. Varying effects were identified from the randomized controlled trials (RCTs), more apparent effects from non-RCTs and minor safety issues in general. From the controlled trials, we identified anxiolytic effects with acute CBD administration, and therapeutic effects for social anxiety disorder, psychotic disorder and substance use disorders. In general, studies were heterogeneous and showed substantial risks of bias. Although promising results have been identified, considerable variation in dosage schemes and route of administration were employed across studies. There was evidence to support single dose positive effect on social anxiety disorder, short medium-term effects on symptomatic improvement in schizophrenia and lack of effect in the short medium-term on cognitive functioning in psychotic disorders. Overall, the administration was well tolerated with mild side effects.},

Methods: We searched Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL) for human trials and observational studies published before September 24, 2018 for clinical trials and observational studies with a comparison group. Two investigators reviewed studies for relevance, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the GRADE and CLARITY frameworks. Study authors were contacted when necessary to obtain additional data. Critically important outcomes included survival to hospital discharge and survival with good neurological outcome. Results: We identified 14 studies, including 1 pseudorandomised clinical trial, 3 observational cohort studies using propensity matching, and 8 simple cohort studies suitable for meta-analysis. The overall certainty of evidence was low to very low. For the critically important outcomes of survival to hospital discharge with good neurologic outcome and survival to hospital discharge results suggested better outcomes achieved with BMV than either TI or SGA; limited data favored SGA over TI. The majority of studies involved out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, with few studies of in-hospital cardiac arrest. Conclusions: TI or SGA are not superior to BMV for resuscitation of children in cardiac arrest, but the overall certainty of evidence is low to very low. Well designed randomised efficacy trials are needed to address this important question.},

They can be dangerous because of their location or nature, making endoscopic extraction urgent. The aim of our study was to evaluate, using a retrospective study, the success rate of extraction of foreign bodies in our context as well as the means used. Over a ten-year period (January 2001 to January 2011), all patients admitted to the emergency services of UHC Hassan-II, Fez, for the ingestion of foreign bodies were recorded. We reviewed the methods used for extraction and the treatment success rate. During this period, 82 oesogastroduodenal endoscopies (OGDE) were performed for the extraction of foreign bodies. There was a male predominance (sex ratio: 1.5), with an average age of 33.5 years (6 to 83 years); all endoscopies were performed in an emergency. Voluntary ingestion was found in 24 cases while 58 cases were accidental. Among foreign bodies frequently encountered, there were needles in 17 cases, impaction of a piece of meat in 14 cases, ingestion of dentures in 11 cases, while other objects (coins, razor blades, nails, nail cutters) were less frequent. The foreign body was found in 32 cases at a gastric level, an oesophageal level for 31 patients, the duodenum for two patients and no foreign body was found for 14 patients. The extraction was done mainly by a hot wire loop and tripod forceps procedure; extraction was a success in 43 cases (52.4\%), a foreign body was not found in 17 cases (20.7\%), and the extraction failed in 13 cases (16\%). No complication after extraction was noted in our context.},

Although no data have been reported to support  a relationship between the gag reflex and dysphagia, the gag reflex is  nevertheless routinely assessed during the bedside dysphagia evaluation. The  purpose of the present study was to investigate whether absence of a gag reflex  is a predictor of dysphagia. METHOD: Fourteen consecutive adult subjects referred  for a bedside dysphagia evaluation because they were considered to be at  increased risk for aspiration, specifically due to absence of a gag reflex, were  investigated. In addition, the gag reflex was assessed in 69 normal adult  volunteers. RESULTS: Although all subjects were referred for bedside dysphagia  evaluations specifically because they had no gag reflex, 86\% (12/14) were  nevertheless able to eat at least a puree diet. In addition, 86\% (12/14) of  subjects with no gag reflex had normal velar movement, reinforcing the  physiologic differences between velar functioning during phonation and the gag  reflex. The gag reflex, traditionally considered part of the bedside dysphagia  evaluation, was absent in 13\% (9/69) of nondysphagic subjects, raising further  doubts regarding its clinical relevancy. CONCLUSION: The absence of a gag reflex  does not appear to be a predictor of dysphagia.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Foreign body (FB) ingestion is common in children, and button battery (BB) ingestion has been increasing in recent years. This study was to identify  factors related to outcomes of FB ingestion, particularly BBs in the stomach. We  evaluated whether the current recommendations are appropriate and aimed to  suggest indications for endoscopic removal of BB in the stomach in young  children. METHODS: We investigated patient age, shape, size, location of FBs,  spontaneous passage time and resulting complications among 76 children. We  observed types, size, location of BB and outcomes, and analyzed their  associations with complications. RESULTS: Coins and BB were the two most common  FBs. Their shapes and sizes were not associated with the spontaneous passage  time. Size, spontaneous passage time, and age were also not associated with any  specific complications. For BB ingestion, all 5 cases with lithium batteries  ({$\geq$}1.5 cm, 3 V) presented moderate to major complications in the esophagus and  stomach without any symptoms, even when the batteries were in the stomach and  beyond the duodenum, while no complications were noted in 7 cases with alkaline  batteries ({$<$}1.5 cm, 1.5 V) (p=0.001). All endoscopies were conducted within 24  hours after ingestion. CONCLUSION: The type and voltage of the battery should be  considered when determining whether endoscopy is required to remove a BB in the  stomach. For lithium battery ingestion in young children, urgent endoscopic  removal might be important in order to prevent complications, even if the child  is asymptomatic and the battery is smaller than 2 cm.},

RESULTS: Foreign bodies were spontaneously  passed in 145 patients (58.2\%), endoscopic removal was performed in 100 patients  (40.2\%), and operative removal was performed in 4 patients (1.6\%). Most SP FBs  were passed within 5 days. The SP rates (SPRs) according to the initial location  were the following: 12.2\% for the esophagus (P{$<$}0.0001), 71.4\% for the stomach,  85.7\% for the small bowel, and 96.4\% for the colon. There was no significant  difference in the SPR according to age. When coins and disk batteries that  required early endoscopic removal were excluded, the SPR was 63.4\% for FBs less  than 10 mm, 80.4\% for FBs 10 to 20 mm, 72.8\% for FBs 20 to 30 mm, and 50.0\% for  FBs more than 30 mm (P=0.091). The initial location of the FB (odds ratio, 33.7;  95\% confidence interval, 14.4-79.0) and the size of the FB (odds ratio, 3.5; 95\%  confidence interval, 1.0-11.6) were independent predictors of SP by multivariate  analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Most FBs in the gastrointestinal tract are spontaneously  passed without complication, and the initial location of FBs was found to be the  main determining factor for SPR. Ingested FBs, in children, even sharp or  relatively large FBs, can be spontaneously passed when they are located below the  esophagus.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: {\enspace}Compared with the blind technique, ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion block (SGB) reduces the amount of local anesthetic needed for a  successful block. The purpose of this study is to determine the minimal, optimal  volume of local anesthetic required for successful ultrasound-guided SGB and to  reduce its adverse effects. METHODS: {\enspace}Thirty-five patients with postherpetic  neuralgia and complex regional pain syndrome of the upper extremity and the  facial area were selected. For ultrasound-guided SGB by subfacial method, each  patient was injected with 0.5\% mepivacaine mixed with contrast media in 2{$\quad$}mL,  3{$\quad$}mL, and 4{$\quad$}mL doses at 2-week intervals. After the procedure, the spread of  contrast media in the spine was checked by fluoroscopy. Ptosis and conjunctival  flushing were rated and recorded. Adverse effects, such as hoarseness, foreign  body sensation, swallowing difficulty, and upper arm weakness, were also  recorded. RESULTS: {\enspace}Out of the 35 initial patients, the results for 33 patients  who received all three SGBs were included in this study. The contrast media  spread to 4.80{$\quad\pm\quad$}0.82, 4.94{$\quad\pm\quad$}0.86, and 5.09{$\quad\pm\quad$}0.97 total spinal segments in the  2{$\quad$}mL, 3{$\quad$}mL, and 4{$\quad$}mL groups, respectively. The cephalad spread of contrast media  was 2.16{$\quad\pm\quad$}0.74, 2.23{$\quad\pm\quad$}0.85, and 2.30{$\quad\pm\quad$}0.78 spinal segments for the 2{$\quad$}mL, 3{$\quad$}mL,  and 4{$\quad$}mL groups, respectively, and the caudad spread of contrast media was  2.64{$\quad\pm\quad$}0.51, 2.70{$\quad\pm\quad$}0.61, and 2.89{$\quad\pm\quad$}0.64 segments in the 2{$\quad$}mL, 3{$\quad$}mL, and 4{$\quad$}mL  groups, respectively. There were no significant statistical differences in any  segments for the three groups (P{$\quad>\quad$}0.05). Review of the fluoroscopic images  showed spread of the contrast media below the C7-T1 junction in all three groups.  Ptosis developed in all three groups after the procedure. CONCLUSION: {\enspace}In  conclusion, when performing an ultrasound-guided SGB, 2{$\quad$}mL dosage was sufficient  for a successful block as the previous, conventional volume. Therefore, when  performing an ultrasound-guided SGB, we recommend the 2{$\quad$}mL dosage of local  anesthetics for a successful block.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of static and dynamic variables of central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) and lactate in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock who underwent early quantitative resuscitation. We also investigated whether ScvO2 measured after initial resuscitation could provide additive prognostic value to that of lactate. We analyzed the sepsis registry for patients presenting to the emergency department and included patients with simultaneous measurements of lactate and ScvO2 at the time of presentation (H0) and 6 hours (H6) after resuscitation. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality and multivariable logistic analysis was used to adjust for confounders. A total of 363 patients were included, and the overall 28-day mortality was 18\%. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for predicting 28-day mortality was as follows: lactate (H6), 0.81; lactate (H0), 0.73; relative lactate change, 0.67; ScvO2 (H6), 0.65; relative ScvO2 change 0.59; ScvO2 (H0), 0.58. Patients with lactate normalization showed significantly lower 28-day mortality compared to patients without lactate normalization (3\% vs. 28\%, P{$<$}0.01). However, in those who achieved ScvO2 (H6)  70\%, there was a significant difference in 28mortality only in patients without lactate normalization (21\% vs. 39\%, P{$<$}0.01) but no difference in those with lactate normalization (4\% vs. 3\%, P = 0.71). In multivariable analysis, lactate normalization was significantly associated with 28-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for 28-day mortality, 0.20; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.07--0.54; P {$<$}0.01), but ScvO2 (H6)  70\% showed only a marginal association (the adjusted OR for 28-day mortality, 0.51; 95\% CI, 0.26--1.01; P = 0.05). ScvO2 (H6)  70\% was associated with 28-day mortality only in cases without lactate normalization in subgroup analysis (adjusted OR 0.37, 95\% CI, 0.18--0.79; P = 0.01). Six-hour lactate was the strongest predictor of 28-day mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Six-hour ScvO2 provided additional prognostic value only in cases where lactate values were not normalized after resuscitation.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The management of foreign body ingestion proves to be a challenge. Magnets pose a unique set of risks when ingested due to their attractive forces  and subsequent risk of adherence, pressure necrosis, and perforation  complications. Radiographs only provide a limited snapshot in the setting of  multiple magnet ingestion when the risk of complication is highest. We  hypothesize that abdominal ultrasound (US) has the potential to supplement  radiographs in assessing ingested magnets by determining the presence of bowel  loop entrapment and of any extraluminal fluid. METHODS: We recreated various  scenarios of magnet configurations using animal cadaveric bowel models. X-ray and  US images were obtained in various bowel-magnet orientations. RESULTS: We  identified several key US features to suggest bowel wall tethering. These include  direct visualization of bowel wall entrapment between magnets (what we term the  "dangerous V sign"), anti-dependent positions of the magnets, and inability to  separate loops of bowel with compression. CONCLUSION: These findings could  potentially provide valuable information when directing the urgency of  intervention~in foreign body ingestion. Ultrasound may supplement and improve the  current guidelines in management of magnet ingestion.},

  abstract = {Since the first case report by Winter-bottom [106], the problem of intraoperative awareness or recall has received increasing attention from patients, anaesthesiologists and, more recently, even law courts [4, 20, 21, 78]. Our own interest in awareness derives from a study with the opiate agonist tramadol as a supplement to balanced anaesthesia, which revealed an unexpectedly high incidence of about 65\% of patients who could recall intraoperative music [55]. It was the aim of the present randomized double-blind study to evaluate, under identical experimental conditions, what the incidence would be with other analgesic supplements to balanced anaesthesia (fentanyl, pentazocine and ketamine). Because few reports on this subject are available in the German literature, it was felt that the result should be discussed within a comprehensive review. PATIENTS AND METHODS. A total of 60 patients (ASA I-II, age 27-66 years, weight 48-93 kg) undergoing elective gynaecological surgery of at least 90 min duration were each randomly assigned to one of three study groups (F, fentanyl; P, pentazocine; K, ketamine). Premedication was performed with diazepam 10 mg p.o. the evening before surgery and pethidine 1 mg/kg i.m.+promethazine 1.5 mg/kg i.m.+atropine 0.5 mg i.m. 60 min before anaesthesia. Induction was performed with alcuronium (2 + 8 mg), methohexital (1.5 mg/kg) and a bolus dose of the analgesic supplement (F, 5 micrograms/kg; P or K, 2 mg/kg), followed by continuous infusion (F, 2 micrograms kg-1 h-1, P or K 0.8 mg kg-1 h-1). Endotracheal intubation was performed with succinylcholine (1 mg/kg). Patients were ventilated to normocarbia using a Takaoka respirator (4 breaths/min, tidal volume 1600 ml, N2O/O2 75:25). If insufficient anaesthesia was suggested by increases in blood pressure or heart rate to more than 20\% of preinduction values, excessive sweating or lacrimation, enflurane (0.5-2 vol.\%) was added for short periods of time. At the end of surgery, patients were ventilated with 100\% O2, and the neuromuscular block antagonized using atropine 0.5 mg and neostigmine 1 mg. Without prior announcement, tape-recorded music (Mantovani, 3 min followed by 3 min silence) was played to all patients via earphones throughout the time period between intubation and the end of nitrous oxide administration. Vegetative parameters, cumulative and relative enflurane application times and retrospective judgement of quality of anaesthesia by the anaesthesiologist were documented. Post-operative recovery and pain were monitored using verbal rating scales. Patients were interviewed immediately after extubation and on the day after surgery to determine the incidence of dreams and recollection of music. Patients were classified as amnestic if they could not recall the music, even with prompting, and partially amnestic if they remembered the music but were unable to define the time when they had heard it. No amnesia was assumed if patients recalled the intraoperative music spontaneously. Groups were statistically compared by means of analysis of variance, Mann-Wilcoxon rank sum test and chi-square test. RESULTS. Mean duration of anaesthesia was 129-134 min in the subgroups. The total analgesic supplement dose was F 614 +/- 129 micrograms, P 238 +/- 38 mg, and K 230 +/- 50 mg (mean +/- SD). Enflurane substitution was necessary in 45 patients, regardless of the type of analgesic supplement. Mean cumulative enflurane application time was 26-28\% in the treatment groups, corresponding to about 20\% of anaesthesia duration. The most important reasons for enflurane substitution were increases in blood pressure (mostly in groups F and P) or heart rate (K). Recovery was fastest with F, followed by P, and slowest with K. Retrospective judgement of the quality of anaesthesia by the anaesthesiologist did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. Most (93\%) of the patients were satisfied with their anaesthesia; 2 patients each who received P and K were dis},

Because central venous catheterisation (CVC) is an established alternative for in-hospital resuscitation, we compared IO access versus landmark-based CVC in adults with difficult peripheral veins. Methods: In this prospective observational study we investigated success rates on first attempt and procedure times of IO access versus central venous catheterisation (CVC) in adults ({$\geq$}18 years of age) with inaccessible peripheral veins under trauma or medical resuscitation in a level I trauma centre emergency department. Results: Forty consecutive adults under resuscitation were analysed, each receiving IO access and CVC simultaneously. Success rates on first attempt were significantly higher for IO cannulation than CVC (85\% versus 60\%, p=0.024) and procedure times were significantly lower for IO access compared to CVC (2.0 versus 8.0. min, p{$<$}0.001). As for complications, failure of IO access was observed in 6 patients, while 2 or more attempts of CVC were necessary in 16 patients. No other relevant complications like infection, bleeding or pneumothorax were observed. Conclusions: IO vascular access is a reliable bridging method to gain vascular access for in-hospital adult patients under resuscitation with difficult peripheral veins. Moreover, IO access is more efficacious with a higher success rate on first attempt and a lower procedure time compared to landmark-based CVC. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Critically unwell and injured patients are routinely given high concentration oxygen in the prehospital phase of care. We aim to investigate the incidence of hyperoxia in major trauma patients receiving pre-hospital emergency anesthesia (PHEA) in the pre-hospital setting and determine factors that may help guide clinicians with pre-hospital oxygen administration in these patients. Methods:{\enspace} A retrospective cohort study was performed of all patients who received PHEA by a single helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) between 1 October 2014 and 1 May 2019 and who were subsequently transferred to one major trauma centre (MTC). Patient and treatment factors were collected from the electronic patient records of the HEMS service and the MTC. Hyperoxia was defined as a \-PaO2\,{$>$}\,16 kPA on the first arterial blood gas analysis upon arrival in the MTC. Results:{\enspace} On arrival in the MTC, the majority of the patients (90/147, 61.2\%) had severe hyperoxia, whereas 30 patients (20.4\%) had mild hyperoxia and 26 patients (19.7\%) had normoxia. Only 1 patient (0.7\%) had hypoxia. The median \-PaO2 on the first arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) after HEMS handover was 36.7 [IQR 18.5--52.2] kPa, with a range of 7.0--86.0 kPa. \-SpO2 pulse oximetry readings before handover were independently associated with the presence of hyperoxia. An S\- pO2\,{$\geq$}\,97\% was associated with a significantly increased odds of hyperoxia (OR 3.99 [1.58--10.08]), and had a sensitivity of 86.7\% [79.1--92.4], a specificity of 37.9\% [20.7--57.8], a positive predictive value of 84.5\% [70.2--87.9] and a negative predictive value of 42.3\% [27.4--58.7] for the presence of hyperoxemia. Conclusion:{\enspace} Trauma patients who have undergone PHEA often have profound hyperoxemia upon arrival at hospital. In the pre-hospital setting, where arterial blood gas analysis is not readily available a titrated approach to oxygen therapy should be considered to reduce the incidence of potentially harmful tissue hyperoxia.},

  abstract = {AIM: To report the initial experience and outcomes of Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) as an adjunct to pre-hospital resuscitation of patients with exsanguinating pelvic haemorrhage. METHODS: Descriptive case series of consecutive adult patients, treated with pre-hospital Zone III REBOA by a physician-led pre-hospital trauma service, between January 2014 and July 2018. RESULTS: REBOA was attempted in 19 trauma patients (13 successful, six failed attempts) and two non-trauma patients (both successful) with exsanguinating pelvic haemorrhage. Trauma patients were severely injured (median ISS 34, IQR: 27-43) and profoundly hypotensive (median systolic blood pressure [SBP] 57, IQR: 40-68\,mmHg). REBOA significantly improved blood pressure (Pre-REBOA median SBP 57, IQR: 35-67\,mmHg versus Post- REBOA SBP 114, IQR: 86-132\,mmHg; Median of differences 66, 95\% CI: 25-74\,mmHg; P\,{$<$}\,0.001). REBOA was associated with significantly lower risk of pre-hospital cardiac arrest (REBOA 0/13 [0\%] versus no REBOA 3/6 [50\%], P\,=\,0.021) and death from exsanguination (REBOA 0/13 [0\%] versus no REBOA 4/6 [67\%], P\,=\,0.004), when compared to patients with a failed attempt. Successful REBOA was associated with improved survival (REBOA 8/13 [62\%] versus no REBOA 2/6 [33\%]; P\,=\,0.350). Distal arterial thrombus requiring thrombectomy was common in the REBOA group (10/13, 77\%). CONCLUSION: REBOA is a feasible pre-hospital resuscitation strategy for patients with exsanguinating pelvic haemorrhage. REBOA significantly improves blood pressure and may reduce the risk of pre-hospital hypovolaemic cardiac arrest and early death due to exsanguination. Distal arterial thrombus formation is common, and should be actively managed.},

However, immobilization and imaging for potential cervical spine injury after trauma are common and are associated with adverse effects. Risk factors for cervical spine injury have been developed to safely limit immobilization and radiography in adults, but not in children. The purpose of our study is to identify risk factors associated with cervical spine injury in children after blunt trauma. Methods We conducted a case-control study of children younger than 16 years, presenting after blunt trauma, and who received cervical spine radiographs at 17 hospitals in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) between January 2000 and December 2004. Cases were children with cervical spine injury. We created 3 control groups of children free of cervical spine injury: (1) random controls, (2) age and mechanism of injury-matched controls, and (3) for cases receiving out-of-hospital emergency medical services (EMS), age-matched controls who also received EMS care. We abstracted data from 3 sources: PECARN hospital, referring hospital, and out-of-hospital patient records. We performed multiple logistic regression analyses to identify predictors of cervical spine injury and calculated the model's sensitivity and specificity. Results We reviewed 540 records of children with cervical spine injury and 1,060, 1,012, and 702 random, mechanism of injury, and EMS controls, respectively. In the analysis using random controls, we identified 8 factors associated with cervical spine injury: altered mental status, focal neurologic findings, neck pain, torticollis, substantial torso injury, conditions predisposing to cervical spine injury, diving, and high-risk motor vehicle crash. Having 1 or more factors was 98\% (95\% confidence interval 96\% to 99\%) sensitive and 26\% (95\% confidence interval 23\% to 29\%) specific for cervical spine injury. We identified similar risk factors in the other analyses. Conclusion We identified an 8-variable model for cervical spine injury in children after blunt trauma that warrants prospective refinement and validation. {\copyright} 2010 American College of Emergency Physicians.},

  abstract = {Background: Travelers' diarrhea is the most common travel-related malady. It affects millions of international travelers to developing countries annually and can significantly disrupt travel plans. Objective: To provide an update on the evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of traveler's diarrhea. Methods: A PubMed search was completed in Clinical Queries using the key term traveler's diarrhea. The search strategy included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews. The search was restricted to English literature. Patents were searched using the key term traveler's diarrhea from www.freepatentsonline.com. Results: Between 10\% and 40\% of travelers develop diarrhea. The attack rate is highest for travelers from a developed country who visit a developing country. Children are at particular risk. Travelers' diarrhea is usually acquired through ingestion of food and water contaminated by feces. Most cases are due to a bacterial pathogen, commonly, Escherichia coli, and occur within the first few days after arrival in a foreign country. Dehydration is the most common complication. Pretravel education on hygiene and on the safe selection of food items is important in minimizing episodes. For mild travelers' diarrhea, the use of antibiotic is not recommended. The use of bismuth subsalicylate or loperamide may be considered. For moderate travelers' diarrhea, antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, and rifaximin may be used. Loperamide may be considered as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. For severe travelers' diarrhea, antibiotics such as azithromycin, fluoroquinolones, and rifaximin should be used. Azithromycin can be used even for the treatment of dysentery whereas fluoroquinolones and rifaximin cannot be used for such purpose. Recent patents related to the management of travelers' diarrhea are discussed. Conclusion: Although travelers' diarrhea is usually self-limited, many travelers prefer expedient relief of diarrhea, especially when they are traveling for extended periods by air or ground. Judicious use of an antimotility agent and antimicrobial therapy reduces the duration and severity of diarrhea.},

  abstract = {Several clinical conditions, in particular those associated with a systemic inflammatory response, can cause some degree of activation of coagulation but when the procoagulant stimulus is sufficiently severe and overcomes the natural anticoagulant mechanisms of coagulation, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may occur. The clinical manifestations of DIC encompass multiorgan dysfunction caused by fibrin-platelet clots in the microcirculation, and bleeding caused by consumption of platelets and coagulation factors. Molecular mechanisms that play a role in inflammation-induced effects on coagulation have been recognized in much detail. Exposure of blood to tissue factor is the most common trigger, whereas the intravascular coagulation is propagated due to loss of function of physiological anticoagulants and impaired fibrinolysis. In patients with DIC, various abnormalities in routine coagulation parameters may be observed, including thrombocytopenia, prolonged global coagulation assays, or high levels of fibrin split products. In addition, more sophisticated tests for activation of individual factors or pathways of coagulation may point to specific involvement of these components in the pathogenesis of the disorder. A combination of readily available tests is usually sufficient in establishing the diagnosis of DIC, and for this purpose, several scoring algorithms have been developed. Some specific clinical situations may elicit coagulation responses that can be distinguished from DIC or may occur in combination with DIC, including dilutional coagulopathy, liver failure-related coagulation derangement, and thrombotic microangiopathies.},

The immediate psychological gain for these patients is  unclear, as the act is insidious with no evidence of intentional harm or  immediate danger. Thus, they are considered as being parasuicidal events designed  to diminish other psychological processes. Aspirated objects that are not  immediately dislodged by coughing, choking, or gagging require surgical  intervention. Most of these patients usually come to the attention of a  psychiatrist, but such intervention does not prevent recurrences.

METHODS: A prospective study including consecutive adult patients with foreign body ingestion or suspected food impaction between May 2014 and August 2016. RESULTS: In total, 521 patients were included, 320 with foreign body ingestion and 201 with suspected food impaction. Food impaction patients were significantly older and more frequently had a history of oesophageal disease. The foreign body was encountered in the upper digestive tract in 43\% of the patients with foreign body ingestion, and food impaction was confirmed in 87\%. Older age (odds ratio (OR)year 1.04, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.06) and early presentation (ORfirst six hours 4.41, 95\% CI 2.24-8.66) were independent predictors of foreign body presence, while a history of psychiatric disease was an independent predictor of food impaction (OR 6.69, 95\% CI 1.66-26.9). Successful endoscopic treatment was achieved in more than 90\% of the cases, with adverse events occurring in fewer than 5\%. Foreign body forceps was the preferred device in foreign body ingestion, while retrieval basket and mobilisation were preferred in food impaction. The need to use more than one instrument was significantly higher in food impaction. CONCLUSION: Foreign bodies are encountered at endoscopy in almost half of the cases. Older age and earlier presentation are independent predictors of its presence. Given the high proportion of patients with foreign body at endoscopy and the low risk of complications, endoscopic evaluation is probably justified in the majority of cases.},

Pediatric and psychiatric patients are the two most common  populations suffering from accidental or in some cases intentional ingestion of  foreign bodies. Commonly, majority of cases require no specific treatment and the  swallowed objects pass through the digestive tract spontaneously without causing  any significant complications. Less than 1\% of the cases complicates with  gastrointestinal tract perforation, which are often caused by sharp objects,  which warrants surgical intervention. The average time from foreign body  ingestion to development of perforation was noted at 10.4\,days in previous  reports. These cases often present in rapidly progressing peritonitis and are  subsequently managed by emergent laparotomy. In this case report, we describe an  accidental chopstick ingestion of a patient who initially was misdiagnosed and  remained asymptomatic for nine months, then presented with acute abdomen. CASE  PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old man accidentally ingested a wooden chopstick and  sought consult at a clinic. Negative abdominal plain film misled the physician to  believe ingested chopstick was digested into fragments and passed out unnoticed.  The patient presented acute abdomen caused by duodenal perforation nine months  later and was subsequently treated with emergency laparotomy with primary  duodenorrhaphy. CONCLUSIONS: Negative plain films are not sufficient to conclude  a conservative treatment in foreign body ingestion. Computed tomography scan or  endoscopic examinations should be done to rule out retained foreign body within  gastrointestinal tract.},

  abstract = {The aim of our article is to study the incidence, diagnosis, and treatment of bowel perforation by foreign body ingestion. Bowel perforation by foreign body ingestion has been believed to be relatively rare, and most commonly caused by fish bones, chicken bones, and toothpicks. Our clinical experience, however, suggests such perforations may be more common than previously thought, and caused by various other objects as well. Medical records of all patients diagnosed with foreign body-induced intestinal perforation, from the Department of General Surgery at Tonji Hospital, from January 2000 to June 2015, were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 17 men and 8 women suffered intestinal perforations by ingestion of dietary foreign bodies. Among the 25 total patients, 4 ingested foreign bodies intentionally, whereas the other 21 cases were accidental. The foreign bodies were identified by plain X-ray film in 2 patients (2 cases of needles) and by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in 11 patients (6 cases of date stones, 3 cases of metallic objects, and 2 cases of bone fragments), thus supporting the correct preoperative diagnosis (13 cases; 52\%). The most common location of the perforation was the terminal ileum (n = 17). The offending objects were date stones (n = 13), bones (n = 7), and metallic objects (n = 5). The most common treatment was removal of the foreign body and closure of the perforation with simple suture (n = 22). Ten patients were treated laparoscopically. The present study shows that the most common foreign bodies causing intestinal perforation are date stones and bones. Although about 50\% of the foreign bodies could be identified by MDCT, definite diagnosis remained preoperatively difficult. Consequently, because of high misdiagnosis rates, laparoscopy may be the optimal choice for diagnosis and treatment of bowel perforation by foreign bodies.},

METHODS:  Based on the medical records of patients younger than 15 years old who visited  emergency room because of foreign body ingestion from January 1999 to December  2012, the authors reviewed clinical characteristics including type of ingested  foreign bodies, time to visits, managements and complications. RESULTS: Fishbone  (50.1\%) was the most common ingested foreign body in children. Among 416 patients  with ingested fishbone, 245 (58.9\%) were identified and removed using  laryngoscope, rigid or flexible endoscope from pharynx or upper esophagus by  otolaryngologists and pediatric gastroenterologists. The kind of ingested fish  bone in children was diverse. The mean age of identified and removed fishbone  group was 7.39 years old, and higher than that of unidentified fishbone group  (5.81 years old, p{$<$}0.001). Identified and removed fishbone group had shorter time  until hospital visit than the unidentified fishbone group (2.03 vs. 6.47 hours,  p{$<$}0.001). No complication due to ingested fishbone or procedure occurred.  CONCLUSION: Older age and shorter time from accident to hospital visit were the  different factors between success and failure on removal of ingested fish bone in  children.},

Procedures performed with a flexible gastrointestinal endoscope were only taken into account. Patients who underwent a technique involving FB or FBI from the digestive tract were only included. Data on patient sex, patient age, outpatient, inpatient, FB type, FB location, procedure time, procedure type, removal device type, success, and technical complications were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Among the 215 procedures, 136 (63.3\%) were performed in old adults ({$\geq$} 60 years), 180 (83.7\%) procedures were performed in outpatients. The most common type of FBs were press-through-pack (PTP) medications [72 (33.5\%) cases], FBI [47 (21.9\%)], Anisakis parasite (AP) [41 (19.1\%) cases]. Most FBs were located in the esophagus [130 (60.5\%) cases] followed by the stomach [68 (31.6\%) cases]. AP was commonly found in the stomach [39 (57.4\%) cases], and it was removed using biopsy forceps in 97.5\% of the cases. The most common FBs according to anatomical location were PTP medications (40\%) and dental prostheses (DP) (40\%) in the laryngopharynx, PTP (48.5\%) in the esophagus, AP (57.4\%) in the stomach, DP (37.5\%) in the small intestine and video capsule endoscopy device (75\%) in the colon. A transparent cap with grasping forceps was the most commonly used device [82 (38.1\%) cases]. The success rate of the procedure was 100\%, and complication were observed in only one case (0.5\%). CONCLUSION: Endoscopic management of FBs and FBI in our Hospital is extremely safe and effective.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The Torg ratio is used as a universal indicator of cervical canal stenosis despite reports of differences between gender and race. Normal  values of this ratio have been established for subjects of different ethnicity,  but the differences between genders and race have not been critically compared.  PURPOSE: To establish normal cervical spinal dimensions and analyze the  differences observed between men and women, and between reports using subjects of  different ethnicity. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Observational. PATIENT SAMPLE: Forty  men and 40 women of Chinese descent with no history or symptoms of neck pathology  selected from patients presenting to the Emergency Department for foreign body  ingestion. OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements of the sagittal developmental diameter  (SDD) and vertebral body diameter (VB) on the lateral cervical radiograph with  calculation of SDD/VB (Torg ratio). METHODS: Lateral radiographs of the cervical  spine were taken in a standardized manner with a 180-cm film-to-tube distance.  Comparison was made between genders in the study population and with previous  reports on subjects of different ethnicity. RESULTS: The SDD was narrowest at the  C4 level in both men and women. Women had smaller SDDs at all levels of the  cervical spine. Female VBs were of sizes similar to their corresponding SDDs,  whereas men had larger VBs. This resulted in small Torg ratios in men averaging  0.87. Comparison with previous reports demonstrated consistent variation in the  SDD, which increased serially from Japanese, through Chinese and Indian, to white  subjects. The relationship of VB to the corresponding SDD displayed wide  variation between reports. This resulted in Torg ratios differing not only  between subjects of different ethnicity but also between genders within the same  population. CONCLUSIONS: The Torg ratio is not a consistent indicator of the SDD  and may not be used to reliably identify the presence of cervical canal stenosis.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The evidence for adrenaline in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) resuscitation is inconclusive. We systematically reviewed the efficacy of adrenaline for adult OHCA. Methods: We searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library from inception to July 2013 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating standard dose adrenaline (SDA) to placebo, high dose adrenaline (HDA), or vasopressin (alone or combination) in adult OHCA patients. Meta-analyses were performed using random effects modeling. Subgroup analyses were performed stratified by cardiac rhythm and by number of drug doses. The primary outcome was survival to discharge and the secondary outcomes were return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to admission, and neurological outcome. Results: Fourteen RCTs (n = 12,246) met inclusion criteria: one compared SDA to placebo (n = 534), six compared SDA to HDA (n = 6174), six compared SDA to an adrenaline/vasopressin combination (n = 5202), and one compared SDA to vasopressin alone (n = 336). There was no survival to discharge or neurological outcome differences in any comparison group, including subgroup analyses. SDA showed improved ROSC (RR 2.80, 95\%CI 1.78--4.41, p {$<$} 0.001) and survival to admission (RR 1.95, 95\%CI 1.34--2.84, p {$<$} 0.001) compared to placebo. SDA showed decreased ROSC (RR 0.85, 95\%CI 0.75--0.97, p = 0.02; I2 = 48\%) and survival to admission (RR 0.87, 95\%CI 0.76--1.00, p = 0.049; I2 = 34\%) compared to HDA. There were no differences in outcomes between SDA and vasopressin alone or in combination with adrenaline. Conclusions: There was no benefit of adrenaline in survival to discharge or neurological outcomes. There were improved rates of survival to admission and ROSC with SDA over placebo and HDA over SDA. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This systematic review aimed to examine the effects of music therapy on pain after orthopedic surgery.                                         Method                                The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Nursing Reference Center (NRC), Airiti Library, and National Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations in Taiwan were searched up to August 2019. The risk of bias from the                 Cochrane Handbook for Randomized Controlled Trials of Interventions                 was used. A standard mean difference (SMD) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) was applied as a summary effect on postoperative pain and anxiety using RevMan version 5.3. A meta-analysis was also carried out using subgroup analysis.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The 2016 European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guidelines recommend that ingested foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract are removed as an emergency within 6 hours, with an endoscopic approach that is individualized according to the type of foreign body identified. This retrospective study evaluated the 10-year experience of a single hospital in China performing emergency removal of ingested foreign bodies in 586 adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2011 and 2020, medical records of 642 adults with a diagnosis of foreign bodies ingestion were retrospectively screened. The timing of endoscopic intervention was classified according to ESGE recommendations. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS We included 586 patients. The median (range) diameter of foreign bodies was 2.5 (1-24) cm: for sharp ones it was 2.5 (1.5-4.0) cm and for long ones it was 16.9 (10-24) cm. The most common site of foreign body lodgment was the esophagus (n=481; 82.1\%); 45.6\% (n=252) received emergent removal within 6 hours, while 32.2\% (n=178) underwent urgent removal within 24 hours. There were 583 (99.5\%) foreign bodies removed successfully and the complication rate was 17.9\%. Major complications occurred in 45 patients (7.7\%). Female sex and non-emergent endoscopy after 6 hours were significantly associated with a higher overall complications rate. For major complications, older age, time interval {$>$}24 hours, and sharper objects were associated with major complications. CONCLUSIONS The findings from this retrospective study support the ESGE statement that endoscopic removal of ingested foreign bodies from the upper GI tract within 6 hours reduces complication rates for adults in the emergency setting.},

  abstract = {Background. Although the clinical importance of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) has received increasing recognition, relatively little is known about its epidemiology. The objective of this study was to estimate the lifetime prevalence of NSSI in adults and its association with sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric disorders, and lifetime treatment for NSSI. Methods. A nationally representative face-to-face survey was conducted with 7192 adults aged {$\geq$}18 years in England. Respondents were interviewed about engagement in NSSI, psychiatric illness, suicidal thoughts and behavior, and treatment history for this behavior. Results. The estimated lifetime prevalence rate of NSSI was 4.86\%. Younger age, growing up without biological parents in the household, being unmarried, and impoverished backgrounds were associated with NSSI. The majority of respondents with lifetime NSSI (63.82\%) had at least one current psychiatric disorder. Most psychiatric conditions were associated with greater odds of lifetime NSSI in multivariate models. NSSI was strongly associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, respectively, even after accounting for psychiatric disorders and sociodemographic covariates. A substantial proportion of respondents with NSSI history (30.92\%) have engaged in medically severe self-harm, as indexed by requiring medical attention for this behavior. The majority of respondents with NSSI (56.20\%) had not received psychiatric care for this behavior. Conclusions. NSSI is prevalent in the general population and associated with considerable psychiatric comorbidity. A high rate of unmet treatment needs is evident among those with this behavior. Those at the greatest lifetime risk for NSSI may also be particularly limited in their resources to cope with this behavior.},

Methods Patients who presented to the Emergency Department with suspected CAP were included in the study. Bedside ultrasonography was performed at each intercostal space in the midclavicular, anterior axillary, midaxillary and paravertebral lines. Any pulmonary consolidation, focal interstitial pattern, pleural-line abnormalities and subpleural lesions were recorded, and the numbers of subpleural lesions and intercostal spaces with pleural-line abnormalities were counted. All patients received bedside CXR and CT. Using CT scan as the gold standard, ultrasonography findings were compared between CAP group and non-CAP group, and between CAP patients with CT showing consolidation or diffuse ground-glass opacification. The sensitivity of ultrasonography was compared with CXR for the diagnosis of CAP. Results Of 179 patients included in the study, 112 were diagnosed with CAP by CT. Patients in CAP group were more likely to have consolidation ( p{$<$}0.001), focal interstitial pattern ( p{$<$}0.001) and had higher number of subpleural lesions ( p{$<$}0.001) and intercostal spaces with pleural-line abnormalities ( p{$<$}0.001) on ultrasound than those without CAP. CAP patients whose CT showed consolidation were more likely to have consolidation ( p{$<$}0.001) and had lower numbers of subpleural lesions ( p{$<$}0.001) and intercostal spaces with pleural-line abnormalities ( p{$<$}0.001) compared to CAP patients whose CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacification. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for ultrasonography and CXR were 94.6\% versus 77.7\% ( p{$<$}0.001), 98.5\% versus 94.0\% ( p=0.940) and 96.1\% versus 83.8\% ( p{$<$}0.001), respectively.

  abstract = {Background: Cardiac arrest (CA) is a serious threat to human health. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an effective treatment for CA. Early and high-quality CPR is closely related to the survival rate of patients with CA. But manual chest compression has a lot of defects. To solve the defects and improve the quality of CPR, mechanical CPR device was invented. However, it has still controversy whether manual chest compression or mechanical chest compression is better. This systematic review was aimed to investigate the difference in clinical outcomes between manual chest compression and Lund University Cardiac Assist System (LUCAS) assisted CPR in patients with out-hospital CA. Methods: Original research studies, conducted on adult out-of-hospital CA, were included. PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, CNKI, and Wanfang database were searched from the setting to February 21, 2019. Odds ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) was selected as effect scale index for evaluation of the difference in return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital admission, survival to hospital discharge, and survival to 30 days. Random effects model was used in this study to estimate overall mean effects. Results: A total of 6 articles, including 4 randomized controlled trials and 2 nonrandomized controlled trials, were selected. And 8501 subjects were involved to analyze the clinical outcomes of LUCAS and manual chest compression for patients with outhospital CA. Comparisons of ROSC (33.3\% vs 33.0\%, P = .98; OR = 1; 95\% CI: [0.89,1.13]), survival to hospital admission (22.7\% vs 24.3\%, P = .32; OR = 0.86; 95\% CI: [0.65,1.15]), survival to hospital discharge (8.6\% vs 10.7\%, P = .50; OR = 0.92; 95\% CI: [0.73,1.17]), and survival to 30 days (7.5\% vs 8.5\%, P = .50; OR = 0.92; 95\% CI: [0.73,1.17]) were made. No significant difference was found. Conclusion: The synthesis of available evidence does not support that mechanical chest compression with LUCAS device improves clinical outcome in out-of-hospital CA patients compared with manual chest compression. Large scale studies with improved designs are still needed in the future.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: About 90\% of perianal infection is caused by cryptoglandular infection. Only a few cases of peritonitis or intra-abdominal abscesses secondary  to perforation of the digestive tract by an ingested foreign body have been  reported. The most common sites of impaction and perforation include the  appendix, cecum and the terminal ileum. The rectum is an unusual site of foreign  body impaction. This report intends to highlight that ingested foreign body  impacted in the rectum is an extremely rare cause of perianal abscess and  subsequent fistula in infants. CASE SUMMARY: Two cases of perianal abscess and  fistula due to ingested jujube pit impacted in the rectum are reported. Both  cases are infants with free previous medical history suffered from recurrent  perianal infection. The caregivers of the two patients denied ingestion of a  foreign body or any history of trauma. Physical examination combined with  ultrasound or computed tomography scan established the diagnosis. Both of the  patients underwent operation under general anesthesia. In case 1, a jujube pit  with sharp ends was discovered embedded within a subcutaneous fistula. The jujube  pit was then removed intact along with fistula resection. The wound was  successfully laid open to allow healing by secondary intention. In case 2, a  jujube pit was found with its sharp end puncturing the rectum, surrounded by pus  and necrotic tissue. Subsequent incision and adequate drainage were performed.  The whole jujube pit was then removed from the abscess cavity at the same time.  Both patients received colonoscopy to rule out inflammatory bowel disease or  other potential damages by the ingested jujube pit. The postoperative period was  uneventful. At 1.5 year follow-up, no recurrent abscess or fistula were found in  either patient. CONCLUSION: An impacted foreign body must not be overlooked as an  unusual cause of perianal abscess and fistula, especially in young children.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist which effectively blocks heroin effects. Since opioid dependence treatment with naltrexone tablets suffers from high dropout rates, several depot injections and implants are under investigation. Sustained-release formulations are claimed to be effective, but a systematic review of the literature is lacking. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of sustained-release naltrexone for opioid dependence and its adverse effects in different study populations. Search methods The following databases were searched from their inception to November 2007: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, trial database at http://clinicaltrials.gov, available NIDA monographs, CPDD and AAAP conference proceedings. The reference lists of identified studies, published reviews and relevant web sides were searched manually. Study authors and drug companies were contacted to obtain any unpublished material or missing data. Selection criteria To evaluate effectiveness only RCTs were included. To evaluate safety, any clinical trial reporting adverse effects was assessed. Treatment condition was extended to include alcohol dependent subjects and healthy volunteers. Data collection and analysis Reviewers independently evaluated the reports, rated methodological quality and extracted data. Analyses were performed separately for opioid dependent, alcohol dependent and healthy participants. Main results Foe effectiveness, one report met inclusion criteria. Two dosages of naltrexone depot injections (192 and 384 mg) were compared to placebo. High-dose significantly increased days in treatment compared to placebo (WMD 21.00, 95\% CI 10.68 to 31.32, p{$<$}0.0001). High-dose compared to low-dose significantly increased days in treatment (WMD 12.00, 95\% CI 1.69 to 22.31, p=0.02). Number of patients retained in treatment did not show significant differences between groups. For adverse effects, seventeen reports met inclusion criteria analyses, six were RCTs. Side effects were significantly more frequent in naltrexone depot groups compared to placebo. In alcohol dependent samples only, adverse effects appeared to be significantly more frequent in the low-dose naltrexone depot groups compared to placebo (RR 1.18, 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.36, p=0.02). In the opioid dependent sample, group differences were not statistically significant. Reports on systematic assessment of side effects and adverse events were scarce. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of sustained-release naltrexone for treatment of opioid dependence.  For naltrexone injections, administration site-related adverse effects appear to be frequent, but of moderate intensity and time limited. For a harm-benefit evaluation of naltrexone implants, more data on side effects and adverse events are needed. Plain language summary People with opioid dependence require substantial therapeutic effort to keep them drug free. Their use of illicit opioids can be reduced and retention in treatment improved with supervised agonist replacement therapy with methadone, which is a highly addictive drug. Naltrexone is a long-acting, opioid-antagonist that blocks heroin effects. It is used to prevent relapse of both opioid and alcohol dependence. Highly motivated people do best with  naltrexone. Most opioid users are sceptical about treatment with naltrexone tablets and many drop out early on. Dropouts can be reduced with supervised tablet taking, offering incentives and using sustained-release naltrexone  such as subcutaneous implants or depot injections.  There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of sustained-release naltrexone. In the one controlled study that met inclusion criteria, 60 outpatients were randomised to one of three groups that received two sequential depot injections of naltrexone (192 or 384 mg) or placebo injections. The mean dropout time was 48 days with high dose naltrexone compared with 27 days on placebo; an increase in  treatment of 21 days (range 11 to 31 days). The lower depot dose gave a lesser benefit. The number retained in treatment at eight weeks did not show a clear difference and ranged from a mean of 68\% to 39\% of participants in  the different groups. 'Wanting heroin' did not differ on naltrexone but 'needing heroin' scored significantly lower with depot naltrexone compared to placebo. The most prominent adverse effects were general symptoms of  fatigue and pain at the injection site. Seventeen reports met inclusion criteria for assessing adverse effects. Seven looked specifically at naltrexone implants for treatment of opioid dependence and wound infection, allergic reaction to the implant and number of implants removed. The majority of the trials did not have a control group and systematic assessment of adverse effects was lacking.},

  abstract = {Methods: A 10-year retrospective database review was conducted to identify trauma patients receiving out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The primary outcome measure was survival to hospital discharge. Results: Nine hundred nine patients had out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Sixty-eight (7.5\% [95\% confidence interval 5.8\% to 9.2\%]) patients survived to hospital discharge. Six patients had isolated head injuries and 6 had cervical spine trauma. Eight underwent on-scene thoracotomy for penetrating chest trauma. Six patients recovered after decompression of tension pneumothorax. Thirty patients sustained asphyxial or hypoxic insults. Eleven patients appeared to have had ``medical'' cardiac arrests that occurred before and was usually the cause of their trauma. One patient survived hypovolemic cardiac arrest. Thirteen survivors breached recently published guidelines. Conclusion: The survival rates described are poor but comparable with (or better than) published survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of any cause. Patients who arrest after hypoxic insults and those who undergo out-of-hospital thoracotomy after penetrating trauma have a higher chance of survival. Patients with hypovolemia as the primary cause of arrest rarely survive. Adherence to recently published guidelines may result in withholding resuscitation in a small number of patients who have a chance of survival. [Ann Emerg Med. 2006;48:240-244.]},

  abstract = {Introduction: Cardiac arrest management primarily focuses on optimal chest compressions and early defibrillation for shockable cardiac rhythms. Non-shockable rhythms such as pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and asystole present challenges in management. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in cardiac arrest is promising. Objectives: This review provides a focused assessment of POCUS in cardiac arrest, with an overview of transthoracic (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), uses in arrest, and literature support. Discussion: Cardiac arrest can be distinguished between shockable and non-shockable rhythms, with management varying based on the rhythm. POCUS provides a diagnostic and prognostic tool in the emergency department (ED), which may improve accuracy in clinical decision-making. Several protocols incorporate POCUS based on different cardiac views. TTE includes parasternal long axis, parasternal short axis, apical 4-chamber, and subxiphoid views, which may be used in cardiac arrest for diagnosis of underlying cause and potential prognostication. TEE is conducted by inserting the probe into the esophagus of intubated patients, with several studies evaluating its use in cardiac arrest. It is associated with few adverse effects, while allowing continued compressions (and evaluation of those compressions) and not interrupting resuscitation efforts. Conclusions: POCUS is a valuable diagnostic and prognostic tool in cardiac arrest, with recent literature supporting its diagnostic ability. TTE can guide resuscitation efforts dependent on the rhythm, though TTE should not interrupt other resuscitation measures. TEE can be useful during arrest, but further studies based in the ED are needed. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Background: Pneumonia is a common and serious infectious disease that can cause high mortality. The role of lung ultrasound (LUS) in the diagnosis of pneumonia is becoming more and more important. Methods: In the present study, we collected existing evidence regarding the use of LUS to diagnose pneumonia in adults and conducted a systematic review to summarize the technique's diagnostic accuracy. We specifically searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, and Embase databases and retrieved outcome data to evaluate the efficacy of LUS for the diagnosis of pneumonia compared with chest radiography or chest computed tomography. The pooled sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE) were determined using the Mantel-Haenszel method, and the pooled diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was determined using the DerSimonian-Laird method. We also assessed heterogeneity of sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio using the Q and I2 statistics. Results: Twelve studies containing 1515 subjects were included in our meta-analysis. The SEN and SPE were 0.88 (95\% CI: 0.86-0.90) and 0.86 (95\% CI: 0.83-0.88), respectively. The pooled negative likelihood ratio (LR) was 0.13 (95\% CI: 0.08-0.23), the positive LR was 5.37 (95\% CI: 2.76-10.43), and the DOR was 65.46 (95\% CI: 29.24-146.56). The summary receiver operating characteristic curve indicated a relationship between sensitivity and specificity. The area under the curve for LUS was 0.95. Conclusion: LUS can help to diagnose adult pneumonia with high accuracy.

However, the danger is not over once bleeding has been arrested and blood pressure restored. Two-thirds of patients who die following major trauma now do so as a result of causes other than exsanguination. Trauma evokes a systemic reaction that includes an acute, non-specific, immune response associated, paradoxically, with reduced resistance to infection. The result is damage to multiple organs caused by the initial cascade of inflammation aggravated by subsequent sepsis to which the body has become susceptible. This Series examines the biological mechanisms and clinical implications of the cascade of events caused by large-scale trauma that leads to multiorgan failure and death, despite the stemming of blood loss. Furthermore, the stark and robust epidemiological finding--namely, that age has a profound influence on the chances of surviving trauma irrespective of the nature and severity of the injury--will be explored. Advances in our understanding of the inflammatory response to trauma, the impact of ageing on this response, and how this information has led to new and emerging treatments aimed at combating immune dysregulation and reduced immunity after injury will also be discussed.},

This review will focus on  the clinical presentation and complications of these two common inadvertent  ingestions in children, as well as recent regulatory efforts and advocacy  opportunities. RECENT FINDINGS: The rising incidence of cannabis toxicity in  children has corresponded with its legalization across several countries in the  last decade. Inadvertent pediatric cannabis intoxication is most commonly due to  the ingestion of edible forms discovered by children in their own home. The  clinical presentation can be nonspecific, therefore clinicians should have a low  threshold for including it on their differential diagnosis. Button battery  ingestions are also increasing in incidence. While many children are asymptomatic  at presentation, button battery ingestions can quickly cause esophageal injury  and lead to several serious and potentially life-threatening complications.  Prompt recognition and removal of esophageal button batteries is essential for  reducing harm. SUMMARY: Cannabis and button battery ingestions are important for  physicians who take care of children to recognize and manage appropriately. Given  their rising incidence, there are many opportunities for policy improvements and  advocacy efforts to make a difference in preventing these ingestions altogether.},

The  two halves of a standard paper clip are tied crosswise with a rubber band,  forming an elastic "cross." With its branches squeezed to lie parallel, the cross  is wrapped into a small strip of paper and ingested. After being released from  its wrapper, the branches of the cross spring back to their original position and  cause perforation of the bowel wall. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: University  hospital, Bulgaria. PATIENTS: Five male prisoners from the same jail undergoing  laparotomy for foreign body removal during 1 week in January 1994. INTERVENTIONS:  Laparotomy, removal of the foreign bodies through incisions of the bowel wall,  immediate restoration of the gastrointestinal tract continuity, and peritoneal  lavage and drainage. OUTCOME MEASURES: Morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Two of  the patients were initially observed but subsequently underwent surgery for  perforations of the gastrointestinal tract. Three of the patients underwent  immediate operative treatment. There were 20 total crosses ingested; all foreign  objects impacted and perforated the stomach (50\%), first duodenal portion (25\%),  and fourth duodenal portion (20\%). There was no morbidity or mortality among the  five patients treated. CONCLUSIONS: Because ingested crosses that have been  released from their wrappers never move distally, the only definitive solution is  to operate early.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to collect and describe all published reports of local tissue injury or extravasation from vasopressor administration via either peripheral intravenous (IV) or central venous catheter. Methods: A systematic search of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases was performed from inception through January 2014 for reports of adults who received vasopressor intravenously via peripheral IV or central venous catheter for a therapeutic purpose. We included primary studies or case reports of vasopressor administration that resulted in local tissue injury or extravasation of vasopressor solution. Results: Eighty-five articles with 270 patients met all inclusion criteria. A total of 325 separate local tissue injury and extravasation events were identified, with 318 events resulting from peripheral vasopressor administration and 7 events resulting from central administration. There were 204 local tissue injury events from peripheral administration of vasopressors, with an average duration of infusion of 55.9 hours ({\textpm}68.1), median time of 24 hours, and range of 0.08 to 528 hours. In most of these events (174/204, 85.3\%), the infusion site was located distal to the antecubital or popliteal fossae. Conclusions: Published data on tissue injury or extravasation from vasopressor administration via peripheral IVs are derived mainly from case reports. Further study is warranted to clarify the safety of vasopressor administration via peripheral IVs.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical presentation of children with either an unwitnessed or witnessed esophageal foreign body.  METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed. Patients were identified using  ICD-9 code for esophageal foreign body. Clinical data and management techniques,  along with complications were abstracted. RESULTS: For the 5-year period of  review, 255 patients were identified with an esophageal foreign body. 214  children had a witnessed ingestion. The mean age of the unwitnessed ingestion  group was 2.3 years, compared to 4.6 years for a witnessed ingestion. In both  groups, males and females were distributed equally and the most common ingested  object was a coin. Bivariate, unadjusted analysis revealed that history of wheeze  (OR, 4.35) and fever (OR, 11.15) had the largest association with patients who  had an unwitnessed ingestion. Multivariate analysis indicated that any physical  findings of wheeze, rhonchi, stridor, or retractions were associated  significantly with a diagnosis of an unwitnessed foreign body. Children less than  2 years of age and with a documented fever are also predictive of an unwitnessed  ingestion. Eleven children (4.3\%) with esophageal abnormalities were also noted  to have foreign bodies. CONCLUSIONS: Children who present to the emergency  department two years old and younger, who have a documented fever and with  respiratory findings should be considered at risk for having a retained  esophageal foreign body. Children with esophageal abnormalities may also be at  risk for retained esophageal foreign bodies.},

In contrast, recurrent and intentional FBI (RIFBI) is  infrequent and associated with greater endoscopic and surgical intervention in  adults. Although pediatric guidelines exist for FBI, the risk and therapeutic  implications of RIFBI are not addressed. An anonymous international survey on  pediatric gastroenterologist experience with RIFBI was distributed. METHODS: A  33-item REDCap{\copyright} survey was distributed via email to pediatric gastroenterologists  identified through mailing and email lists obtained from pediatric  gastroenterology professional organizations. RESULTS: During 9-12/2021 we accrued  202 completed surveys. Respondents were from 27 countries and across the career  span. Eighty percent reported experience with RIFBI; 74\% reported seeing\,{$\leq$}\,3  patients with RIFBI within the past 24 months and 4\% reported seeing\,{$\geq$}\,6. Of  those who treated RIFBI, 38\% reported an average number of annual ingestions per  patient was {$\geq$}5. Frequent morbidity but not mortality was reported. Half reported  adherence to FBI guidelines. Later-career endoscopists treated RIFBI more  aggressively than accidental ingestion. Ninety-six percent noted that patients  with RIFBI had psychiatric comorbidities. Providers at academic medical centers  reported referring to behavioral health more than those in other settings.  CONCLUSION: Most gastroenterologists surveyed reported encountering RFBI several  times a year and in patients with psychiatric comorbidities. Greater likelihood  of adverse outcomes associated with endoscopy was reported. Most reported  referral to behavioral health and few had RIFBI management protocols. A broader  spectrum of psychologic comorbidities in the pediatric population with RIFBI,  notably depression and autism spectrum disorder, were reported.},

We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of EGDT on mortality in adults with severe sepsis and septic shock. Methods: We searched electronic databases to identify randomized controlled trials that compared EGDT with usual care or lactate-guided therapy in adults with severe sepsis and septic shock. Predefined primary outcome was all-cause mortality at final follow-up. Results: We included 13 trials enrolling 5268 patients. Compared with usual care, EGDT was associated with decreased mortality (risk ratio [RR]: 0.87, 95\% CI: 0.77-0.98; 4664 patients, 8 trials; Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation [GRADE] quality of evidence was moderate). Compared with lactate clearance--guided therapy, EGDT was associated with increased mortality (RR: 1.60, 95\% CI: 1.24-2.06; 604 patients, 5 trials; GRADE quality of evidence was low). Patients assigned to EGDT received more intravenous fluid, red cell transfusion, vasopressor infusion, and dobutamine use within the first 6 hours than those assigned to usual care (all P values {$<$} .00001). Conclusion: Adults with severe sepsis and septic shock who received EGDT had a lower mortality than those given usual care, the benefit may mainly be attributed to treatments administered within the first 6 hours. However, the underlying mechanisms by which lactate clearance--guided therapy benefits these patients are yet to be investigated.},

The outcome is conventionally collected through a structured interview with the patient alone or together with a caretaker. Despite the fact that using the structured interview questionnaires helps reach agreement in GOSE assessment between raters, significant variation remains among different raters. We introduce an alternate GOSE rating system as an aid in determining GOSE scores, with the objective of reducing inter-rater variation in the primary outcome assessment in TBI trials. Forty-five trauma centers were randomly assigned to three groups to assess GOSE scores on sample cases, using the alternative GOSE rating system coupled with central quality control (Group 1), the alternative system alone (Group 2), or conventional structured interviews (Group 3). The inter-rater variation between an expert and untrained raters was assessed for each group and reported through raw agreement and with weighted kappa (k) statistics. Groups 2 and 3 without central review yielded inter-rater agreements of 83\% (weighted k {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.81; 95\% CI 0.69, 0.92) and 83\% (weighted k {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.76, 95\% CI 0.63, 0.89), respectively, in GOS scores. In GOSE, the groups had an agreement of 76\% (weighted k {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.79; 95\% CI 0.69, 0.89), and 63\% (weighted k {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.70; 95\% CI 0.60, 0.81), respectively. The group using the alternative rating system coupled with central monitoring yielded the highest inter-rater agreement among the three groups in rating GOS (97\%; weighted k {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.95; 95\% CI 0.89, 1.00), and GOSE (97\%; weighted k {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.97; 95\% CI 0.91, 1.00). The alternate system is an improved GOSE rating method that reduces inter-rater variations and provides for the first time, source documentation and structured narratives that allow a thorough central review of information. The data suggest that a collective effort can be made to minimize inter-rater variation.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Gastrointestinal bleeding refers to loss of blood from any site of the digestive tract. In paediatric clinical practice, it is usually a complaint of children attending the emergency department as a symptom of diseases such as ulcers, gastric or oesophageal varices, gastritis, Mallory-Weiss tears, anorectal fissures, allergic colitis, infectious colitis, intussusception, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and Meckel's diverticulum; it also occurs with high incidence in critically ill children hospitalised in intensive care units and is caused by stress-induced gastropathy. No matter what the cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, fasting is believed to be necessary due to the fear that eating may affect haemostasis or aggravate bleeding. Objectives To assess the effects and safety of fasting for haemostasis in gastrointestinal bleeding in children. Search methods We searched EBM Reviews - the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (May 2016), Ovid MEDLINE(R) (1946 to 3 May 2016), EMBASE (1980 to 2016 Week 18), Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1978 to 3 May 2016), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to 3 May 2016), VIP Database (1989 to 4 May 2016) and Wanfang Data (1990 to 4 May 2016). We used no restrictions on language or study setting and limited searches in CNKI and Wanfang Data to the medical field. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs in children with gastrointestinal bleeding that compared fasting with feeding. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the literature search results, and there were no disagreements. Main results We identified no RCTs or quasi-RCTs that compared the effects and safety of fasting with feeding for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding. No study fulfilled the criteria for considering studies for our review. Authors' conclusions There is currently no information available from RCTs or quasi-RCTs to support or refute the use of fasting for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding. Plain language summary Fasting for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding Review question To determine the effects and safety of fasting for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding. Background Gastrointestinal bleeding refers to loss of blood from any site of the digestive tract. If the bleeding site is near the ligament of Treitz (the muscle extending from the junction of the duodenum and jejunum to the diaphragm), it is described as upper gastrointestinal bleeding. If the bleeding site is away from the ligament of Treitz, it is described as lower gastrointestinal bleeding. People with a small amount of blood loss may have no symptoms, and have bloody vomiting or see blood in the stool with increased bleeding. Chronic mild gastrointestinal bleeding can lead to anaemia, causing fatigue or pallor; acute massive gastrointestinal bleeding can be life-threatening. Gastrointestinal bleeding has two scenarios in children. The first is a complaint of attending the emergency department as a symptom of diseases such as ulcers, gastritis, Mallory-Weiss tears, anorectal fissures, allergic colitis, infectious colitis, intussusception, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and Meckel's diverticulum. The second occurs in critically ill children hospitalised in intensive care units and is caused by stress-induced gastropathy. The incidence of the first scenario has not been well established, but there are substantial cases in paediatric intensive care units in the second scenario. Whatever the cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, fasting is believed to be necessary due to the fear that eating may affect haemostasis or aggravate bleeding. Study characteristics We searched EBM Reviews- Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (May 2016), Ovid MEDLINE(R) (1946 to 3 May 2016), EMBASE (1980 to 2016 Week 18), Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1978 to 3 May 2016), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to 3 May 2016), VIP Database (1989 to 4 May 2016) and Wanfang Data (1990 to 4 May 2016). We used no restrictions on language or study setting and limited searches in CNKI and Wanfang Data to medical field. We did not find any randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials providing information about the effects and safety of fasting for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding. Key results A randomised study is required to compare the effects and safety of fasting with feeding for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding, especially for critically ill children, who are at high risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.},

  abstract = {Heparanase, a heparan sulfate-specific glucuronidase, mediates the onset of pulmonary neutrophil adhesion and inflammatory lung injury during early sepsis. We hypothesized that glomerular heparanase is similarly activated during sepsis and contributes to septic acute kidney injury (AKI). We induced polymicrobial sepsis in mice using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in the presence or absence of competitive heparanase inhibitors (heparin or nonanticoagulant N-desulfated re-N-acetylated heparin [NAH]). Four hours after surgery, we collected serum and urine for measurement of renal function and systemic inflammation, invasively determined systemic hemodynamics, harvested kidneys for histology/protein/mRNA, and/or measured glomerular filtration by inulin clearance. CLP-treated mice demonstrated early activation of glomerular heparanase with coincident loss of glomerular filtration, as indicated by a {$>$}twofold increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and a {$>$}50\% decrease in inulin clearance (P {$<$} 0.05) in comparison to sham mice. Administration of heparanase inhibitors 2 h prior to CLP attenuated sepsis-induced loss of glomerular filtration rate, demonstrating that heparanase activation contributes to early septic renal dysfunction. Glomerular heparanase activation was not associated with renal neutrophil influx or altered vascular permeability, in marked contrast to previously described effects of pulmonary heparanase on neutrophilic lung injury during sepsis. CLP induction of renal inflammatory gene (IL-6, TNF-a, IL-1b) expression was attenuated by NAH pretreatment. While serum inflammatory indices (KC, IL-6, TNF-a, IL-1b) were not impacted by NAH pretreatment, heparanase inhibition attenuated the CLP-induced increase in serum IL-10. These findings demonstrate that glomerular heparanase is active during sepsis and contributes to septic renal dysfunction via mechanisms disparate from heparanase-mediated lung injury.},

  abstract = {Background: Cervical spine fractures (CSFs) are potentially devastating injuries in pediatric population. Fortunately, these injuries are uncommon in pediatric patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the epidemiology, the risk factors, mechanisms of injury and to identify possible strategies for prevention. In addition, the aim of the current study was to compare CSF sustained in 2003 to CSF sustained in 2008 and 2013 so as to recognize the trend of pediatric CSFs in the United States. Methods: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System was queried for CSF sustained in pediatric population up to 16 years of age for years 2003, 2008, and 2013. Outcomes of interest were patient characteristics (age and sex), causes of CSF, and mechanism of injury. Results: Eighty pediatric patients with CSF were identified. The average age was 10.5 years. Boys sustained significantly more CSF than girls. Statistically significant more CSF were occurred in children of 10--16 years than in children up to 9 years. Sports or recreational activities and home-related accidents were the predominant causes of CSF. Mechanisms of injury were age-related, with younger children sustaining CSF as a result of home-related accidents while adolescents commonly injured during sporting or recreational activities. In contrast to current data in literature, motor vehicle accidents were not a major cause of CSF. Comparing the years 2003, 2008, and 2013, statistically significant differences in the incidence of CSF were not found. Conclusions: Our study confirms previous findings that adolescents who sustain CSF have higher incidence of sport or recreation-related accidents than younger patients who sustain commonly home-related accidents as a consequence of insufficient parental supervision. The perception that motor vehicle accidents comprise major cause of CSF appears not to be true.},

In one instance the perforation occurred in a loop of intestine lying incarcerated in a hernial sac. The other case was a perforation of the cecum by a toothpick. Ninety-three cases have been collected from the literature and studied. The following points were brought out: 1.1. The types of foreign bodies ingested included metal objects such as pins and wires; bony objects such as chicken or fish bones; wooden splinters; and other bizarre pointed bodies.2.2. Seventy-three per cent of the perforations occurred in and around the ileocecal region, the remainder being distributed generally from the stomach to the rectum.3.3. Six cases of perforation of the intestine with a hernial sac were reported.4.4. Duration of symptoms ranged from a few hours to two weeks in 50 per cent of the cases. The remainder of the cases had longer histories.5.5. Types of pathology observed were classified into five groups: early localized peritonitis, inflammatory masses, abscesses, general peritonitis and hemorrhage.6.6. The mortality in respect to the surgical period before and after the year 1900 shows a 53.5 per cent mortality in the former period and 10 per cent in the latter.},

METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted on all patients (527) who were admitted with esophageal FB during a period of 9 years from January 1992 to January 2000. Two major referral hospitals were involved: the Princess Basma and Al-Bashir hospitals. A data sheet was constructed in which we included: name, age, gender, presenting symptoms, type and site of FB, technique of removal, and complications if present. RESULTS: Of the 527 patients 53\% were male and 47\% were female.77\% were children under the age of 10 years. In children coins were by far the most common FB to be found in the esophagus (68\%), while bones were the principal FB to be found in adults (8\%). In 89\%, the FB was found at the level of cricopharyngeal muscle. Drooling of saliva (72\%), dysphagia (71\%), and vomiting (24\%) were the most commonly presenting symptoms. Both rigid esophagoscopy and Magill forceps techniques were used to remove the FB from the esophagus. The complication rate was 2\% which included: esophageal perforation and mediastinitis, esophageal stenosis and esophageal erosions. CONCLUSION: The pattern of esophageal FB in Jordan is not different from other countries.},

The presence or absence of a pericardial effusion was determined, and all images were captured on video or as thermal images. All emergency echocardiograms were subsequently reviewed by the Department of Cardiology for the presence of a pericardial effusion. Results: During the study period, a total of 515 patients at high risk were enrolled. Of these, 103 patients were ultimately deemed to have a pericardial effusion according to the comparative standard. Emergency physicians detected pericardial effusion with a sensitivity of 96\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 90.4\% to 98.9\%), specificity of 98\% (95\% CI 95.8\% to 99.1\%), and overall accuracy of 97.5\% (95\% CI 95.7\% to 98.7\%). Conclusion: Echocardiography performed by emergency physicians is reliable in evaluating for pericardial effusions; this bedside diagnostic tool may be used to examine specific patients at high risk. Emergency departments incorporating bedside ultrasonography should teach focused echocardiography to evaluate the pericardium.},

This study tested the hypothesis that bovine hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier, HBOC-201, would improve resuscitation and extend early survival from exsanguinating hemorrhage. This study simulated the prehospital scenario of rapidly exsanguinating hemorrhage with prolonged prehospital time and lack of blood availability. Severe hemorrhagic shock was induced in swine by using multiple liver lacerations. At 9 min after the onset of bleeding, swine were randomized to receive approximately 10 mL/kg/min of i.v. lactated Ringer's solution (n = 10) or HBOC-201 (n = 7) to achieve a mean aortic pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg. Thereafter, infusion rate was adjusted to maintain MAP at 60 mmHg for up to 2 h. All animals were initially successfully resuscitated. The results showed 2-h survival was 1 of 10 with lactated Ringer's and 7 of 7 with HBOC-201 (P = 0.0004). Nine lactated Ringer's swine had cardiovascular collapse at 36 +/- 10 min. Lactate at 30 min was 18 +/- 3 mmol/L with lactated Ringer's and 12 +/- 2 mmol/L with HBOC-201 (P {$<$} 0.05). Hematocrit was {$<$}1\% in 9 of 10 lactated Ringer's and 6 of 7 HBOC-201 animals. These data indicate that HBOC-201 improved early survival and stabilized hemodynamic and metabolic parameters vs. lactated Ringer's in this swine model of liver injury with uncontrolled, lethal hemorrhage that simulates the prehospital care environment where allogenic blood is unavailable.},

We sought to determine the value of a portable ultrasound device for triage of patients with suspected PE referred to the emergency department, using simplified echo criteria. We prospectively studied 103 consecutive patients with suspected PE, referred to our emergency department. After D-dimer screening, 76 patients were prospectively enrolled in this ultrasound study and underwent helical chest tomography, transthoracic echocardiography, and venous ultrasonography. Among patients with PE (n = 31), a right ventricular dilation was detected in 17 patients (55\%), a direct visualization of clot in the lower limbs was present in 18 patients (58\%), and 8 patients (26\%) had both right ventricular dilation and deep venous thrombosis. The sensitivity and specificity of a combined ultrasound strategy using echocardiography and venous ultrasonography were respectively 87\% (95\% confidence interval 74\% to 96\%), and 69\% (95\% confidence interval 53\% to 82\%). The sensitivity of this combined strategy was significantly improved as compared to venous ultrasonography alone (P = 0.01) or echocardiography alone (P = 0.005). In patients with dyspnea or with high clinical probability of PE, this combined strategy was particularly relevant with high sensitivities (respectively 94\% and 100\%). Echocardiography combined with venous ultrasonography using a portable ultrasound device is a reliable method for screening patients with suspected PE referred to an emergency department, especially in patients with dyspnea or with high clinical probability.},

Endogenous molecules, called alarmins, are reputed to be released by injured tissues but the precise identity of these mediators is unclear. This review summarizes current preclinical and clinical evidence for trauma alarmins and their role in innate immune activation. Methods: A comprehensive literature review of putative alarmins in tissue damage after traumatic injury was conducted. Results: The presence of SIRS at admission is an independent predictor of mortality after trauma. The primary initiators of the human immune response are unclear. Several endogenous substances display alarmin characteristics in vitro. Preclinical studies demonstrate that blockade of certain endogenous substances can reduce adverse clinical sequelae after traumatic injury. Human evidence for trauma alarmins is extremely limited. Conclusion: The magnitude of acute inflammation is predictive of outcome after trauma, suggesting that an early opportunity for immune modulation may exist. An understanding of the mechanisms of innate immune activation following trauma may lead to new therapeutic agents and improved patient survival.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Intentional multiple drugs overdose is an often-encountered method of self-harm in adolescence. Treatments include supportive therapy, antidotes (when available) and decontamination techniques with the aim of reducing drugs absorption by the gastrointestinal system to minimize toxicity. Nevertheless, the decontamination techniques currently used, such as gastric lavage (GL), activated charcoal or whole-bowel irrigation, have a questionable effectiveness. Endoscopic gastric decontamination (EGD) treatment for massive ingestion of drugs or formation of pharmacobezoars is currently described only in anecdotal cases. Here we describe the management of an intentional drug overdose in an adolescent patient treated with EGD and the effects of this therapy on drugs pharmacokinetics. Case report: A 15-year-old boy was admitted in an unconscious state (Glasgow Coma Scale: 7--8) to the pediatric intensive care unit after assuming an unspecified amount of quetiapine, aspirin, bisoprolol, fluoxetine, furosemide, alprazolam, and pregabalin pills. Rapid sequence intubation was immediately performed and then the patient was treated with symptomatic therapy and GL with minimal removal of gastric material. Accounting for the type of drugs, the time elapsed from oral assumption and the unknown quantity assumed, EGD was attempted with aim of removing potential aggregate of the drugs. Serial blood samples were taken before and after EGD to measure the plasma level of the drugs. A pharmacobezoar was found and was immediately removed with EGD. The results of the drug monitoring showed that quetiapine exceeded the toxic level reported in literature indicating that it may have been the drug assumed in higher quantity by our patient. PICU stay was uneventful, and the patient was transferred to the psychiatric ward after extubation. Discussion: Our case shows how GL is not effective in mitigating multidrug absorption especially drugs potentially inducing pharmacobezoars. Furthermore, based on our plasma drug monitoring, we believe that early EGD should be considered in all cases of massive pill intake, prolonged release drugs that can form pharmacobezoars or in cases where a life-threatening dose cannot be excluded.},

The most frequent techniques used were abdominal plain radiography and ultrasonography (US), performed in 38.4\% and 37.9\% of patients, respectively, followed by computed tomography (CT) in 28\% of patients. Plain radiography yielded a sensitivity of 28\% and specificity of 91.1\%; the sensitivity increased to 79.4\% in patients with small bowel obstruction. Ultrasonography's sensitivity and specificity were 61.8\% and 98.4\%, respectively; the sensitivity of US reached 85.2\% and 90\% in patients with acute cholecystitis/biliary colic and urolithiasis, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of CT were 87.8\% and 92.9\%, respectively. Plain radiography is still overused in the diagnostic work-up of AAP in ED in Italy, despite its unsatisfactory sensitivity. Ultrasonography and CT has a higher sensitivity and should be used as first-level imaging in most patients.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Rib fractures are a common injury presenting to major trauma centres and community hospitals. Aside from the acute impact of rib fracture injury, longer-term morbidity of pain, disability and deformity have been described. Despite this, the mainstay of management for the vast majority of rib fracture injuries remains supportive only with analgesia and where required respiratory support. This study aimed to document the long-term quality of life in a cohort of major trauma patients with rib fracture injury over 24 months. Methods: Retrospective review (July 2006--July 2011) of 397 major trauma patients admitted to The Alfred Hospital with rib fractures and not treated with operative rib fixation. The main outcome measures were quality of life over 24 months post injury assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended and SF12 health assessment forms and a pain questionnaire. Results: Assessment over 24 months of major trauma patients with multiple rib fractures demonstrated significantly lower quality of life compared with published Australian norms at all time points measured. Return to work rates were poor with only 71\% of those who were working prior to their accident, returning to any work. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a significant reduction in quality of life for rib fracture patients requiring admission to hospital, which does not return to the level of Australian norms for at least two years.},

The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of Cu toxicity on two grapevine rootstocks, Fercal and 196.17, and to elucidate if intercropping with oat can alleviate grapevine Cu toxicity. Plants were hydroponically-cultivated and treated with different Cu concentrations. At harvest the biomass accumulation, the SPAD index and the symplastic and apoplastic root and leaves ionome were measured to evaluate possible synergistic and/or antagonistic effects on other micro- and macronutrients. The root exudation analysis was correlated with genes expression (VvPEZ-like), whereas PCA analysis performed on the grapevine and oat ionome revealed that both mono- and intercropped 196.17 rootstock display a positive effect on Zn and Mn in the root tissues at high Cu concentrations. An increase of Zn and Mn in roots was also reported for the intercropped Fercal rootstock at high Cu concentrations while an antagonistic relation was reported for root Zn concentration in the monocropped Fercal rootstock. Our results showed that grapevine and oat compete for nutrient uptake and that this phenomenon can possibly alleviate grapevine Cu toxicity. However, Fercal rootstock is able to take advantage from oat, while 196.17 is disadvantaged by the intercropping system. Even though intercropping system seems to be a valuable tool to counteract grapevine Cu toxicity, the application of this agricultural practice has shown to be species dependent and should be evaluated for each rootstock.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A  prospective study was performed on 36 patients (26 F, 10 M, mean age 70 years)  with a history of foreign body impaction. All had negative findings at indirect  laryngoscopy. Radiologic assessment included unenhanced helical CT and a barium  contrast study. Patients with positive findings were taken to esophagoscopy. All  patients had a posterior clinical surveillance. RESULTS: Twenty patients had both  normal CT and barium study and satisfactory clinical outcome. In 12 patients a  foreign body was noted in the cervical esophagus by CT, barium study, and  endoscopy. In one patient a fish bone was detected by CT (and not by barium)  confirmed with esophagoscopy. Another patient had a fish bone esophageal  perforation which was observed only by CT and confirmed at surgery. Two patients  with normal barium and endoscopy presented a false-positive CT result.  CONCLUSION: Barium swallow is currently the first radiologic study, but may  involve a risk of aspiration and can impede a subsequent esophagoscopy.  Esophagoscopy is an invasive technique with a certain risk of serious  complications that can be avoided with a satisfactory radiologic assessment. CT  is easy, fast, has 100\% sensitivity and is therefore the first choice technique  for diagnosing suspected upper esophageal foreign bodies not expected to be  visible on plain radiographs.},

The technical aspects of Foley extraction are reviewed along with the controversy surrounding the procedure. Series totaling 294 cases document a cumulative success rate of 85\% without significant complications. The technique, when performed by airway experts, is concluded to be a viable alternative to endoscopic removal. Lateral films, fluoroscopic extraction, and barium studies in select cases are recommended as safeguards against missing nonobvious foreign bodies of the esophagus.},

  abstract = {Ingested or penetrating foreign bodies are common in veterinary medicine. When they are radiolucent, these objects become a diagnostic challenge, but they can  be investigated sonographically. However, successful object identification  depends on the skill of the sonographer. Considering that these cases appear  randomly during hospital routines, it is not always possible to train all  students to identify them correctly. Therefore, the aim of this study was to  produce homemade simulations of radiolucent foreign bodies for veterinary student  demonstrations that could be identified sonographically and to evaluate the  acceptability, applicability, and usefulness of these simulations according to a  visual analog scale questionnaire and subjective questions. For this purpose,  object models (a pacifier nipple, a toy ball, a sock, nylon thread, and a mango  seed) were designed, produced, and immersed in gelatin. To simulate wood  splinters in the integumentary and musculoskeletal system, a piece of meat  punctured with a toothpick and ice cream stick splinters were used. The type of  phantom had a determinant effect on the visualization (chi-square = 36.528, P {$<$}  0.0001) and recognition (chi-square = 18.756, P = 0.0021) capability of the  students. All of the students answered that their experience with the models  could help in real situations. The student responses to the questionnaire  indicated that the project was well accepted, and the participants believed that  this experience could be applicable to and useful in veterinary routines.},

  abstract = {Background: Central venous pressure (CVP) is used almost universally to guide fluid therapy in hospitalized patients. Both historical and recent data suggest that this approach may be flawed. Objective: A systematic review of the literature to determine the following: (1) the relationship between CVP and blood volume, (2) the ability of CVP to predict fluid responsiveness, and (3) the ability of the change in CVP (⌬CVP) to predict fluid responsiveness. Data sources: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and citation review of relevant primary and review articles. Study selection: Reported clinical trials that evaluated either the relationship between CVP and blood volume or reported the associated between CVP/⌬CVP and the change in stroke volume/cardiac index following a fluid challenge. From 213 articles screened, 24 studies met our inclusion criteria and were included for data extraction. The studies included human adult subjects, healthy control subjects, and ICU and operating room patients. Data extraction: Data were abstracted on study design, study size, study setting, patient population, correlation coefficient between CVP and blood volume, correlation coefficient (or receive operator characteristic [ROC]) between CVP/⌬CVP and change in stroke index/cardiac index, percentage of patients who responded to a fluid challenge, and baseline CVP of the fluid responders and nonresponders. Metaanalytic techniques were used to pool data. Data synthesis: The 24 studies included 803 patients; 5 studies compared CVP with measured circulating blood volume, while 19 studies determined the relationship between CVP/⌬CVP and change in cardiac performance following a fluid challenge. The pooled correlation coefficient between CVP and measured blood volume was 0.16 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.03 to 0.28). Overall, 56 ؎ 16\% of the patients included in this review responded to a fluid challenge. The pooled correlation coefficient between baseline CVP and change in stroke index/cardiac index was 0.18 (95\% CI, 0.08 to 0.28). The pooled area under the ROC curve was 0.56 (95\% CI, 0.51 to 0.61). The pooled correlation between ⌬CVP and change in stroke index/cardiac index was 0.11 (95\% CI, 0.015 to 0.21). Baseline CVP was 8.7 ؎ 2.32 mm Hg [mean ؎ SD] in the responders as compared to 9.7 ؎ 2.2 mm Hg in nonresponders (not significant). Conclusions: This systematic review demonstrated a very poor relationship between CVP and blood volume as well as the inability of CVP/⌬CVP to predict the hemodynamic response to a fluid challenge. CVP should not be used to make clinical decisions regarding fluid management.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Mortality and morbidity are higher among patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure than among those with heart failure alone. Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation has been proposed as a means of improving outcomes among patients with heart failure who are otherwise receiving appropriate treatment. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation who did not have a response to antiarrhythmic drugs, had unacceptable side effects, or were unwilling to take these drugs to undergo either catheter ablation (179 patients) or medical therapy (rate or rhythm control) (184 patients) for atrial fibrillation in addition to guidelines-based therapy for heart failure. All the patients had New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35\% or less, and an implanted defibrillator. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or hospitalization for worsening heart failure. RESULTS After a median follow-up of 37.8 months, the primary composite end point occurred in significantly fewer patients in the ablation group than in the medicaltherapy group (51 patients [28.5\%] vs. 82 patients [44.6\%]; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.87; P\,=\,0.007). Significantly fewer patients in the ablation group died from any cause (24 [13.4\%] vs. 46 [25.0\%]; hazard ratio, 0.53; 95\% CI, 0.32 to 0.86; P\,=\,0.01), were hospitalized for worsening heart failure (37 [20.7\%] vs. 66 [35.9\%]; hazard ratio, 0.56; 95\% CI, 0.37 to 0.83; P\,=\,0.004), or died from cardiovascular causes (20 [11.2\%] vs. 41 [22.3\%]; hazard ratio, 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.29 to 0.84; P\,=\,0.009). CONCLUSIONS Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure was associated with a significantly lower rate of a composite end point of death from any cause or hospitalization for worsening heart failure than was medical therapy.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND               The management of trauma patients has changed radically in the last decade, and studies have shown overall improvements in survival. However, reduction in mortality for the many may obscure a lack of progress in some high-risk patients. We sought to examine the outcomes for hypotensive patients requiring laparotomy in UK military and civilian cohorts.                                         METHODS               We undertook a review of two prospectively maintained trauma databases: the UK Joint Theatre Trauma Registry for the military cohort (February 4, 2003, to September 21, 2014) and the trauma registry of the Royal London Hospital major trauma center (January 1, 2012, to January 1, 2017) for civilian patients. Adults undergoing trauma laparotomy within 90 minutes of arrival at the emergency department (ED) were included.                                         RESULTS                                Hypotension was present on arrival at the ED in 155 (20.4\%) of 761 military patients. Mortality was higher in hypotensive casualties (25.8\% vs. 9.7\% in normotensive casualties;                 p                 {$<$} 0.001). Hypotension was present on arrival at the ED in 63 (35.7\%) of 176 civilian patients. Mortality was higher in hypotensive patients (47.6\% vs. 12.4\% in normotensive patients;                 p                 {$<$} 0.001). In both cohorts of hypotensive patients, neither the average injury severity, the prehospital time, the ED arrival systolic blood pressure, nor mortality rate changed significantly during the study period.                                                        CONCLUSIONS               Despite improvements in survival after trauma for patients overall, the mortality for patients undergoing laparotomy who arrive at the ED with hypotension has not changed and appears stubbornly resistant to all efforts. Specific enquiry and research should continue to be directed at this high-risk group of patients.

Secondary objectives were to develop a test--treatment threshold model and to calculate interval likelihood ratios (LRs) for natriuretic peptides (NPs) by pooling patient-level results. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and selected bibliographies were searched from January 1965 to March 2015 using MeSH terms to address the ability of the following index tests to predict AHF as a cause of dyspnea in adult patients in the ED: history and physical examination, electrocardiogram, chest radiograph (CXR), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), lung ultrasound (US), bedside echocardiography, and bioimpedance. A diagnosis of AHF based on clinical data combined with objective test results served as the criterion standard diagnosis. Data were analyzed using Meta-DiSc software. Authors of all NP studies were contacted to obtain patient-level data. The Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) for systematic reviews was utilized to evaluate the quality and applicability of the studies included. Results: Based on the included studies, the prevalence of AHF ranged from 29\% to 79\%. Index tests with pooled positive LRs {$\geq$} 4 were the auscultation of S3 on physical examination (4.0, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 2.7 to 5.9), pulmonary edema on both CXR (4.8, 95\% CI = 3.6 to 6.4) and lung US (7.4, 95\% CI = 4.2 to 12.8), and reduced ejection fraction observed on bedside echocardiogram (4.1, 95\% CI = 2.4 to 7.2). Tests with low negative LRs were BNP {$<$} 100 pg/mL (0.11, 95\% CI = 0.07 to 0.16), NT-proBNP {$<$} 300 pg/ mL (0.09, 95\% CI = 0.03 to 0.34), and B-line pattern on lung US LR (0.16, 95\% CI = 0.05 to 0.51). Interval LRs of BNP concentrations at the low end of ``positive'' results as defined by a cutoff of 100 pg/mL were substantially lower (100 to 200 pg/mL; 0.29, 95\% CI = 0.23 to 0.38) than those associated with higher BNP concentrations (1000 to 1500 pg/mL; 7.12, 95\% CI = 4.53 to 11.18). The interval LR of NT-proBNP concentrations even at very high values (30,000 to 200,000 pg/mL) was 3.30 (95\% CI = 2.05 to 5.31). Conclusions: Bedside lung US and echocardiography appear to the most useful tests for affirming the presence of AHF while NPs are valuable in excluding the diagnosis.

  abstract = {Background: Cervical spine clearance in the very young child is challenging. Radiographic imaging to diagnose cervical spine injuries (CSI) even in the absence of clinical findings is common, raising concerns about radiation exposure and imaging-related complications. We examined whether simple clinical criteria can be used to safely rule out CSI in patients younger than 3 years. Methods: The trauma registries from 22 level I or II trauma centers were reviewed for the 10-year period (January 1995 to January 2005). Blunt trauma patients younger than 3 years were identified. The measured outcome was CSI. Independent predictors of CSI were identified by univariate and multivariate analysis. A weighted score was calculated by assigning 1, 2, or 3 points to each independent predictor according to its magnitude of effect. The score was established on two thirds of the population and validated using the remaining one third. Results: Of 12,537 patients younger than 3 years, CSI was identified in 83 patients (0.66\%), eight had spinal cord injury. Four independent predictors of CSI were identified: Glasgow Coma Score {$<$}14, GCSEYE = 1, motor vehicle crash, and age 2 years or older. A score of {$<$}2 had a negative predictive value of 99.93\% in ruling out CSI. A total of 8,707 patients (69.5\% of all patients) had a score of {$<$}2 and were eligible for cervical spine clearance without imaging. There were no missed CSI in this study. Conclusions: CSI in patients younger than 3 years is uncommon. Four simple clinical predictors can be used in conjunction to the physical examination to substantially reduce the use of radiographic imaging in this patient population. {\copyright} 2009 by Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Management of anticoagulated patients after head injury is unclear due to lack of robust evidence. This study aimed to determine the adverse outcome rate in these patients and identify risk factors associated with poor outcome. Design: Multicentre, observational study using routine patient records. Setting: 33 emergency departments in England and Scotland. Participants: 3566 adults (aged {$\geq$}16 years) who had suffered blunt head injury and were currently taking warfarin. Main outcome measures: Primary outcome measure was rate of adverse outcome defined as death or neurosurgery following initial injury, clinically significant CT scan finding or reattendance with related complication within 10 weeks of initial hospital attendance. Secondary objectives included identifying risk factors for adverse outcome using univariable and multivariable analyses. Results: Clinical data available for 3534/3566 patients (99.1\%), median age 79 years; mean initial international normalised ratio (INR) 2.67 (SD 1.34); 81.2\% Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 15: 59.8\% received a CT scan with significant head injury-related finding in 5.4\% (n=208); 0.5\% underwent neurosurgery; 1.2\% patients suffered a head injury-related death. Overall adverse outcome rate was 5.9\% (95\% CI 5.2\% to 6.7\%). Patients with GCS=15 and no associated symptoms had lowest risk of adverse outcome (risk 2.7\%; 95\% CI 2.1 to 3.6). Patients with GCS=15 multivariable analysis (using imputation) found risk of adverse outcome to increase when reporting at least one associated symptom: vomiting (relative risk (RR) 1.8; 95\% CI 1.0 to 3.4), amnesia (RR 3.5; 95\% CI 2.1 to 5.7), headache (RR 1.3; 95\% CI 0.8 to 2.2), loss of consciousness (RR 1.75; 95\% CI 1.0 to 3.0). INR measurement did not predict adverse outcome in patients with GCS=15 (RR 1.1; 95\% CI 1.0 to 1.2). Conclusions: In alert warfarinised patients following head injury, the presence of symptoms is associated with greater risk of adverse outcome. Those with GCS=15 and no symptoms are a substantial group and have a low risk of adverse outcome. Trial registration number: NCT02461498.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Recurrent intentional foreign body (RIFB) ingestion is a complex and costly issue among patients in prison and those with psychiatric disorders. Risk  factors for RIFB ingestion include male sex, incarceration, and the presence of a  psychiatric disorder. Most patients can be managed with observation and  endoscopy. Surgery is indicated in cases involving perforation or obstruction.  The literature on preventative strategies for RIFB ingestion is scarce. CASE  REPORT A 23-year-old man required 6 admissions in 1 calendar year for intentional  foreign body ingestions. The patient was living in prison and had a history of  bipolar I disorder, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. He  underwent 9 endoscopic procedures that retrieved a total of 64 objects. The  primary imaging modalities were abdominal X-ray and abdominopelvic  contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan. The patient was managed with  endoscopy and, in 2 cases, with observation alone. Serial abdominal examinations  and abdominal films were used to monitor the progress of foreign bodies that were  difficult to retrieve. A bowel regimen with polyethylene glycol facilitated the  passage of the objects. The patient never required surgical intervention. The  mean length of stay was 4.17 days. The recurrent ingestions may have been related  to compulsions and family stress. CONCLUSIONS Interdisciplinary collaboration is  paramount in formulating effective treatment plans and limiting recurrence.  Proposed strategies to prevent RIFB ingestion include the removal of ingestible  objects from the environment, specialized prison units for close monitoring,  early psychiatric intervention with appropriate pharmacologic/behavioral therapy,  and limiting hospital admissions to prevent secondary gain. Further studies are  needed to determine the most effective approach to manage and prevent RIFB  ingestion.},

Most ingested sharp metallic bodies pass through the digestive tract spontaneously and patients can be managed conservatively. Sometimes, however, perforation develops and surgical treatment is necessary. It is hard to localize ingested sewing needles because they tend to scatter widely in the digestive tract and are impalpable manually. We report a psychiatric patient who ingested six sewing needles: one intact needle was found at the larynx, one had penetrated into the stomach, one was in the duodenum, one was in the cecum, one was broken into two pieces, and the final needle was broken into three pieces. All of the broken fragments were in the colon. The needle at the larynx was removed by a laryngoscope. Subsequently, we used mini C-arm fluoroscopy to localize the remaining needles and successfully removed all of them intraoperatively.},

Oesophageal  food impaction is the commonest cause of oesophageal foreign bodies in the  Western hemisphere. Intentionally ingested foreign bodies may be organic or  inorganic, and often require intervention; these patients have either underlying  psychological or mental disease or are involved in illegal activities such as  body packing, which involves trafficking narcotics.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to validate the usefulness of MDCT for diagnosis of a sharp or pointed esophageal foreign body according to esophageal  level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with a history of sharp or  pointed foreign body ingestion were reviewed retrospectively. Two observers  interpreted the CT and the conventional radiography datasets separately. If a  foreign body was directly identified, it was regarded as a positive finding. Even  if no high-density foreign body was found, detection of a secondary finding was  considered to be a positive finding. Diagnostic performance of MDCT and  conventional radiography were compared according to esophageal level. Final  diagnosis was made by esophagoscopy or surgery in addition to the  clinicoradiologic result. RESULTS: MDCT was statistically superior to  conventional radiography for diagnosis of a thoracic esophageal foreign body for  both observers (p {$<$} 0.001 for each). No significant difference in sensitivity  between CT and conventional radiography for diagnosis of cervical esophageal  foreign body was noted regardless of observer. Both observers could identify all  complicated conditions with MDCT regardless of esophageal level. However, in two  of three cases of complicated thoracic esophageal foreign bodies, neither  observer could detect foreign bodies on conventional radiography; furthermore,  the observers could not identify pneumomediastinum. CONCLUSION: In cases of sharp  or pointed foreign body ingestion, if the result of an initial inspection of oro-  and hypopharynx reveals negative findings, the first imaging modality should be  MDCT for better diagnosis and management.},

Likewise, radiology in the forward areas is generally confined to scout films of the thorax, the special investigations being left to the radiologist at the special chest centres.In modern warfare, the radiological investigation of a chest wound falls into two main classes:---(a) At Advanced Surgical Centres and C.C.S'sFilms at this stage will generally be in the nature of scout films, to give a general estimation of the intra-thoracic damage. There is little place for complicated radiological examinations at this stage. Many of the patients are severely ill, often with multiple wounds, and as the portability of the apparatus (W.D. 85/15 unit) used of necessity limits its output, recourse to short distance technique must be made.Using this technique, the anode film distance may be reduced to 30 in. or even less, to eliminate movement. The resulting distortion is no bar to correct interpretation as the lesion, unfortunately, is seldom minimal, whilst on the other hand the slightest movement may obscure even the most massive of lesions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early coronary angiography remains controversial in patients without ST-segment elevation following OHCA. Observational studies have demonstrated a potential survival benefit, but are potentially confounded by selection bias. Physician decision making is further complicated by the lower incidence of culprit lesions in patients without STelevation; and, the difficulty in determination of neurological prognosis at the time of presentation. The Cardiac Arrest Hospital Prognosticator (CAHP) score utilizes seven variables (age, non-shockable rhythm, time from collapse to basic life support, time from basic life support to return of spontaneous circulation, location of cardiac arrest, epinephrine dose, and arterial pH) and has been shown to be a reliable predictor of neurologic outcomes (Maupain et al. 2016). ST-segment deviation and prior history of CAD have been proposed to help identify OHCA survivors without ST-elevation who might benefit from angioplasty in deciding to pursue early angiography (Wong et al. CJC 2017). The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the CAHP score to help guide decision making regarding the need for urgent coronary angiography in survivors of OHCA; and, to determine the association between dynamic ST-segment changes, or a history of angina or CAD with the presence of a culprit coronary artery lesion in those patients without ST elevation. Based on these findings, we have developed a decision pathway for the use of angiography in survivors of OHCA. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 336 OHCA patients admitted to the Foothills Medical Center Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) between 2009 and 2016 was conducted. Chi-squared and t-tests were used to assess differences in categorical and continuous variables respectively. Associations were assessed using odds ratios. RESULTS: A CAHP score of {$>$}200 demonstrated a specificity for in-hospital death of 93.94\% (89.9-96.74\%), and was inversely associated with the decision to pursue angiography in patients with and without ST-elevation, but not with early angiography. ST deviation but not prior CAD/angina was predictive of a culprit lesion in patients without ST-elevation (Figure 1). These factors were not found to be associated with the decision to pursue early coronary angiography. CONCLUSION: Given the paucity of data supporting the benefit of early angiography in patients without ST-elevation, an elevated CAHP score (  200) conferring poor prognosis is a},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: As part of a larger study of  the effects of retained lead bullets on blood lead, a retrospective review of  study findings was completed on 5 of 8 patients who sustained injuries to the  maxillofacial region. These 5 patients were recruited into the larger study  within 11 days of injury and showed a penetration path for the projectile that  engaged the upper aerodigestive tract. All subjects were recruited from patients  presenting for care of their gunshot injuries to a large inner-city trauma center  with a retained bullet resulting from a gunshot injury. An initial blood lead  level was measured for all recruited patients and repeated 1 to 17 weeks later.  Medical history was taken along with a screening and risk factor questionnaire to  determine other potential or actual sources (occupational/recreational) of lead  exposure. (109)Cd K-shell x-ray fluorescence determinations of bone lead were  completed to determine past lead exposure not revealed by medical history and  risk factor questionnaire. Radiographs taken of the abdomen and chest, required  as a part of the patient's hospital care, were retrospectively reviewed for signs  of metallic fragments along the aerodigestive tract. RESULTS: All 5 patients  retained multiple lead pellets or fragments at the site of injury, sustained  fractures of the facial bones, and showed increases in blood lead. Three of the 5  study subjects who sustained maxillofacial gunshot injuries involving the mouth,  nose, or throat region showed metallic densities along the gastrointestinal tract  indicative of ingested bullet fragments. Each patient with ingested bullet  fragments showed rapid elevation of blood lead exceeding 25 microg/dL and  sustained increases well beyond the time when all ingested fragments were  eliminated. A 3-year follow-up on these 3 patients showed significantly sustained  elevation of blood lead but less than that observed during the initial 6 months  after injury. None of the 5 study subjects showed any evidence of metallic  foreign bodies within the tracheobronchial regions indicative of aspiration.  CONCLUSION: Ingestion of lead fragments can result from gunshot injuries to the  maxillofacial region and may substantially contribute to a rapid increase in  blood lead level. Prompt diagnosis and elimination of ingested lead fragments are  essential steps necessary to prevent lead being absorbed from the  gastrointestinal tract. Increased blood lead in victims after gunshot injuries  must be fully evaluated for all potential sources, including recent environmental  exposure, absorption of lead from any remaining bullets in body tissues, and the  possibility of mobilization of lead from long-term body stores such as bone.},

The diagnosis of intestinal perforation  following blister ingestion is often delayed because of an unreliable history and  nonspecific clinical presentation. The purpose of this case report is to raise  awareness about a rare but difficult diagnosis and its importance in avoiding  potentially fatal events. CASE REPORT Herein, we describe successful cases of  surgical and endoscopic removal after blister ingestion. The first case was that  of a polymorbid 75-year-old man who presented with acute onset of abdominal pain  in the right upper quadrant and epigastric regions. No indication of the cause  was observed on initial computed tomography (CT). The patient developed an acute  abdomen, and emergency laparotomy was performed, during which 2 small  perforations were observed in the terminal ileum, and an empty tablet blister was  retrieved. The second patient was a 55-year-old man who presented with a  considerable lack of awareness. On the initial CT, a subdural hematoma,  aspiration, and an unidentified foreign body in the stomach were observed.  Gastroscopy was performed after emergency craniotomy. In addition to the initial  foreign body, a second object, which had gone unnoticed on the initial CT, was  found and removed from the esophagus. CONCLUSIONS With an increased risk of  perforation and difficult clinical and radiological diagnoses, prophylactic  measures and special awareness of high-risk patients are particularly important.},

The intervention was PLUS conducted by verified clinician sonographers. The primary outcome measure was time from ED arrival to transfer to operative care; secondary outcomes included computed tomography (CT) use, length of stay, complications, and charges. Regression models controlled for confounders and analyzed physician-to-physician variability. All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Results are presented as mean, first-quartile, median, and third-quartile, with multiplicative change and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), or percentage with odds ratio and 95\% CIs. Results: Four hundred forty-four patients with suspected torso trauma were eligible; 136 patients lacked consent, and attending physicians refused enrollment of 46 patients. Two hundred sixty-two patients were enrolled: 135 PLUS patients and 127 controls. There were no important differences between groups. Time to operative care was 64\% (48, 76) less for PLUS compared to control patients. PLUS patients underwent fewer CTs (odds ratio 0.16) (0.07, 0.32), spent 27\% (1, 46) fewer days in hospital, and had fewer complications (odds ratio 0.16) (0.07, 0.32), and charges were 35\% (19, 48) less compared to control. Conclusion: A PLUS-inclusive protocol significantly decreased time to operative care in patients with suspected torso trauma, with improved resource use and lower charges.

This review discusses the anaesthetic potential risks and complications observed  with tattooing and piercing, their management and prevention. RECENT FINDINGS:  Airway management during anaesthesia is of particular interest with oral jewelry.  Patients often refuse to remove their piercing for fear of tract closure. There  are no serious complications reported after epidural puncture through a tattoo,  although any long-term consequence cannot be discarded yet. Even theoretical  concerns are more and more debated. SUMMARY: Oral and nasal piercing is of  particular concern because of the risks of swallowing and aspiration.  Consequently, patients should be advised to remove piercing before anaesthesia.  Emergency situations are especially risky and anaesthesiologists should be aware  of the piercing removal techniques. In case of piercing loss, radiographies and  fiberoptic endoscopy of the upper airways and digestive tracts should be  performed to eliminate aspiration or swallowing of the foreign body. Epidurals  should not be denied to parturients with lumbar tattooing. However, it seems  still prudent to avoid direct tattoo puncture or when unavoidable, to nick the  skin prior to inserting the needle through the tattoo.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Foreign body ingestion causes a serious health problems like bleeding, abscess formation, septicemia, perforation, and obstruction of the esophagus, stomach and the intestine. In adults, foreign body ingestion is more common in the elderly, individuals with mental illness or who have an intellectual disability, alcohol poisoning, prison inmates, and drug traffickers. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 22 year old male patient who presented with abdominal distension and vomiting of ingested matter of two to three episodes per day of one month duration. He is a known schizophrenic patient for the past three years and has been on follow up at a nearby hospital. He swallowed metallic nails in an attempt to kill himself. On abdominal examination there was distension, and epigastric tenderness. His plain abdominal x-ray showed multiple radiopaque foreign body in the stomach. Similarly, abdominal ultrasound showed thickened gastric wall and multiple linear foreign bodies in the stomach. Then, with the impression of gastric outlet obstruction secondary to foreign body in the stomach, laparotomy plus gastrotomy plus foreign body removal and repair were done under general anesthesia. Dilated stomach, palpable mass on distal stomach and first part of duodenum, and adhesion between stomach, abdominal wall and liver was found intra operatively. CONCLUSION: Passage of curved metal through the throat is a rare case. Mentally ill individuals need close follow up and physiological consultation.},

  abstract = {Biocentrism environmental ethicists and animal rights defenders have been articulating ethical principles to extend moral standing to nonhuman beings. The natural propensities of living beings to pain and pleasure, being a subject of life, and having specific good and interest (as proposed by Singer, Regan, Tayler, and Goodpaster, respectively), have been taken as a reason to determine the moral status of the beings in question. This article makes the case that none of them can offer all-inclusive ideal for biocentrism to embrace all life forms as moral patients since they are either exclusive, hierarchical, or imprecise. To this end, I argue that it is possible to drive a unifying ideal from Schopenhauer's metaphysics: the will to live. The will to live is a quality that all living beings share, regardless of their abilities and propensities. Both conscious and unconscious beings, sentient and non-sentient creatures, lower animals and plants are the embodi\-ments or physical forms of the ultimate reality that is the will to live. Thus, biocentrism becomes more valid and effective in environmental preservation by incorporating the will to live into its ethical principle.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Best Practices recommends initial massive transfusion (MT) cooler delivery within 15 minutes of protocol activation, with a goal of 10 minutes. The current study sought to examine the impact of timing of first cooler delivery on patient outcomes. METHODS: Patients predicted to receive MTat 12 Level I trauma centers were randomized to two separate transfusion ratios as described in the PROPPR trial. Assessment of Blood Consumption score or clinician gestalt prediction of MTwas used to randomize patients and call for initial study cooler. In this planned subanalysis, the time to MT protocol activation and time to delivery of the initial cooler were evaluated. The impact of these times on mortality and time to hemostasis were examined using both Wilcoxon rank sum and linear and logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 680 patients, the median time from patient arrival to MT protocol activation was 9 minutes with a median time from MT activation call to delivery of first cooler of 8 minutes. An increase in both time to MT activation and time to arrival of first cooler were associated with prolonged time to achieving hemostasis (coefficient, 1.09; p = 0.001 and coefficient, 1.16; p {$<$} 0.001, respectively). Increased time to MT activation and time to arrival of first cooler were associated with increased mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; p = 0.009 and OR, 1.02; p = 0.012, respectively). Controlling for injury severity, physiology, resuscitation intensity, and treatment arm (1:1:1 vs. 1:1:2), increased time to arrival of first cooler was associated with an increased mortality at 24 hours (OR, 1.05; p = 0.035) and 30 days (OR, 1.05, p = 0.016).

  abstract = {Background/Aims: Intentional ingestion of foreign bodies is a frequent occurrence in the prison environment. The aim of this study is to describe the profile of inmates who have ingested foreign bodies, to determine the nature of these foreign bodies and to specify their management. Materials and Methods: Our retrospective and descriptive study focused' on 13 inmates having ingested' 47 foreign bodies and who consulted the emergency of our department over a 5-year period from January 2018 to July 2023. Results: The study population consisted of 12 men and one woman with an average age of 32 years (24 years-47 years). Foreign bodies ingested by inmates were dominated by batteries (59.52\%) followed by lighters (19.04\%). The majorit{\'y} of foreign bodies were, at the time of discovery, located mainly in the stomach (6 cases) and colon (4 cases). Ingestion resulted in epigastric pain (3 cases), externalized gastrointestinal bleeding with epigastralgia (2 cases), and no symptoms (8 cases). Of the 13 cases of foreign body ingestion, 6 patients underwent endoscopic extraction in the gastroenterology department. Extraction was by diathermic loop, dormia loop and endoscopic basket. Successful extraction was achieved in 4 cases (66.66\%), and unsuccessful extraction in 2 cases (33.33\%). Only one inmate required surgical extraction, and in 6 patients the elimination of foreign bodies in the stool was spontaneous under medical supervision. Conclusion: Foreign body ingestion is frequent and voluntary in the prison environment. It is characterized by the multiplicity of foreign bodies. The rate of successful extraction of ingested foreign bodies in our practice is satisfactory, requiring an experienced endoscopist to perform the extraction without complications and avoid recourse to surgery. Education of the prison population is important, and psychological follow-up is essential.},

The number of choking accidents has not decreased because its mechanism remains unclear; the manner in which such accidents occur cannot be observed. The purpose of this study is to visualize choking on toys by using a computer simulation, Swallow Vision (R), after creating a new child model of swallowing. An organ model for the simulation was created from the CT of a 9-month-old boy and videofluorographic images during swallowing for a 9-month-old girl. The organ models were defined as hyperelastic and contained particles that moved by forced displacement. The toy models were spheres with diameters of 10 and 15 mm and different coefficients of friction and restitution. The applied calculation method was the Hamiltonian Moving Particle Simulation. The results demonstrated that the simulation could visualize how a toy model obstructed the upper airway in the pharynx and larynx. Moreover, the ball size and the coefficients of friction and restitution affected the site obstructed. As choking accidents were successfully visualized using the Swallow Vision (R), The computer simulation is expected to advance research on understanding the choking mechanism.},

  abstract = {Several pharmacological interventions reduce perioperative stress hormone release during surgery under general anesthesia. Listening to music and therapeutic suggestions were also studied, but mostly in awake patients, and these have a positive effect on postoperative recovery and the need for analgesia. In this study, we evaluated the effect of listening to music under general anesthesia on the neurohormonal response to surgical stress as measured by epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) blood levels. Thirty female patients scheduled for abdominal gynecological procedures were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups: group NM (no music) and group M (music). In group M, music was played from after the induction of anesthesia until the end of surgery. In the NM group, the patients wore the headphones but no music was played. We established three sample times for hormonal dosage during the procedure and one in the recovery room. Hemodynamic data were recorded at all times, and postoperative consumption of morphine in the first 24 h was noted. There was no group difference at any sample time or in the postoperative period in terms of mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, isoflurane end-tidal concentration, time of the day at which the surgery was performed, bispectral index (BIS) value, doses of fentanyl, or consumption of postoperative morphine. There was no difference between the two groups with regard to plasmatic levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, cortisol, or ACTH at any sample time, although the blood level of these hormones significantly increased in each group with surgical stimulation. In conclusion, we could not demonstrate a significant effect of intraoperative music on surgical stress when used under general anesthesia. IMPLICATIONS: Listening to music under general anesthesia did not reduce perioperative stress hormone release or opioid consumption in patients undergoing gynecological surgery.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Intracranial pressure control has long been recognized as an important requirement for patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Hypertonic saline has drawn attention as an alternative to mannitol in this setting. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of hypertonic saline versus mannitol on clinical outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury in prehospital, emergency department, and intensive care unit settings by systematically reviewing the literature and synthesizing the evidence from randomized controlled trials.                                         Methods               We searched the MEDLINE database, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Igaku Chuo Zasshi (ICHUSHI) Web database with no date restrictions. We selected randomized controlled trials in which the clinical outcomes of adult patients with traumatic brain injury were compared between hypertonic saline and mannitol strategies. Two investigators independently screened the search results and conducted the data extraction. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes were 90-day and 180-day mortality, good neurological outcomes, reduction in intracranial pressure, and serum sodium level. Random effects estimators with weights calculated by the inverse variance method were used to determine the pooled risk ratios.                                         Results               A total of 125 patients from four randomized trials were included, and all the studies were conducted in the intensive care unit. Among 105 patients from three trials that evaluated the primary outcome, 50 patients were assigned to the hypertonic saline group and 55 patients were assigned to the mannitol group. During the observation period, death was observed for 16 patients in the hypertonic saline group (32.0\%) and 21 patients in the mannitol group (38.2\%). The risks were not significant between the two infusion strategies (pooled risk ratio, 0.82; 95\% confidence interval, 0.49--1.37). There were also no significant differences between the two groups in the other secondary outcomes. However, the certainty of the evidence was rated very low for all outcomes.                                         Conclusions               Our findings revealed no significant difference in the all-cause mortality rates between patients receiving hypertonic saline or mannitol to control intracranial pressure. Further investigation is warranted because we only included a limited number of studies},

The family reported a history of ingestion of multiple metallic nails one week  before presentation. Abdominal examination showed generalized tenderness and  guarding. Plain abdominal X-ray showed multiple metallic nails in the upper  abdomen and the right lower abdomen. Laparotomy was performed, one of the nails  was causing perforation of the gastric wall, huge number of metallic nails were  extracted from the stomach and cecum, appendectomy was performed. CONCLUSION:  Ingestion of sharp and long foreign bodies usually requires surgical  intervention, after surgery close observation and psychological consultation is  required to prevent repeated ingestions.},

  abstract = {Background: The objective of this study was to characterize the incidence, risk factors, and patterns of cervical spine injury (CSI) in different pediatric developmental ages. Methods: A retrospective review of the National Trauma Data Bank was conducted for the period of January 2002 through December 2006 to identify pediatric patients admitted following blunt trauma. Patients were stratified into 4 developmental age groups: infants/toddlers (age 0-3 years), preschool/young children (age 4-9 years), preadolescents (age 10-13 years), and adolescents (age 14-17 years). Patients with a CSI were identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Demographics, clinical injury data, level of CSI, and outcomes were abstracted and analyzed. Results: A total of 240,647 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 1.3\% (n = 3,035) sustained a CSI. The incidence of CSI in the stratified age groups was 0.4\% in infants/toddlers, 0.4\% in preschool/young children, 0.8\% in preadolescents, and 2.6\% in adolescents. The level of CSI (upper [C1-C4] vs lower [C5-C7]) according to the age groups was as follows: infants and toddlers, 70\% vs 25\%; preschool/young children, 74\% vs 17\%; preadolescents, 52\% vs 37\%; and adolescents, 40\% vs 45\%, respectively. The adjusted risk for CSI increased 2-fold in preadolescents and 5-fold in adolescents. Conclusion: The incidence of pediatric CSI increases in a stepwise fashion after 9 years of age. We noted an increase in lower CSI and a decrease in upper CSI after the age of 9 years. The incidence of upper CSI compared with lower CSI was higher in preadolescents (52\% vs 37\%) and almost equal in adolescents (40\% vs 45\%). {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

This study aims to report the exceptional case of a patient with a foreign body lodged in the ileocecal region revealed by sub-occlusive syndromes. The study involved a patient aged 22 years with no particular past medical history, presenting with K{\"o}nig's syndrome evolving in a context of alteration of the general state. Anatomopathological examination of surgical ileocecal specimen performed after inconclusive endoscopy, histologic examination of the biopsies and scannography, showed ileocecal thickening due to infammatory response to a foreign body. In the absence of anamnestic data, ileocecal foreign body poses a real problem of differential diagnosis including inflammatory, infectious and tumoral diseases of the ileocecal junction. The presence of a foreign body may be revealed by occlusive complications or perforations, hence the essential role of imaging. Endoscopy always plays a central diagnostic and therapeutic role in the management of ingested foreign bodies, thus reducing surgical morbidity (although it is sometimes unavoidable). Anatomopathological study shows foreign body granuloma. Cases of foreign body lodged in the ileocecal region have been rarely reported. Now they should be suspected in patients with any symptom, including ileocecal junction disorders, in order to avoid side effects and complications due to heavy treatments.},

  abstract = {Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in critically ill patients, especially among septic patients. Sepsis and hypovolemia are the 2 most frequent etiologies of AKI in intensive care units and frequently coexist in critically ill patients. Effective fluid resuscitation is crucial for the stabilization of sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion or septic shock. However, the lack of a goal-directed therapy targeting kidney oxygenation prevents from optimization of the fluid therapy with regard to improvement of renal oxygen delivery and extraction. Similarly, fluid administration as all therapeutic actions carries adverse effects such as the activation of cytokines, disruption of the capillary glycocalyx, and adverse effects on kidney metabolism and oxygenation. Moreover, a positive fluid balance is associated with an increased risk of AKI and is a negative predictor for recovery of renal function. The role of fluid resuscitation on kidney injury stems from the high renal vulnerability to hypoxemic injury. Indeed, fluids have a poor oxygen solubility and hemodilution decreases blood viscosity both promoting intrarenal shunting and heterogeneity with a decreased capillary density and enhanced intrarenal cortex and medullary hypoxia. The development of physiological biomarkers that are able to detect the early development of AKI specifically aimed at the identification of renal microcirculatory dysfunctions should form a valuable contribution to monitoring therapeutic modalities.},

Methods:               Prospective, observational study at an urban teaching ED with {$>$}100,000 visits/year. Four EP investigators with prior ultrasound experience underwent focused echocardiography training. A convenience sample of 51 adult patients with symptomatic hypotension was enrolled. Exclusion criteria were a history of trauma, chest compressions, or electrocardiogram diagnostic of acute myocardial infarction. A five-view transthoracic echocardiogram was recorded by an EP investigator who estimated ejection fraction (EF) and categorized LVF as normal, depressed, or severely depressed. A blinded cardiologist reviewed all 51 studies for EF, categorization of function, and quality of the study. Twenty randomly selected studies were reviewed by a second cardiologist to determine interobserver variability.               Results:               Comparison of EP vs. primary cardiologist estimate of EF yielded a Pearson's correlation coefficient R = 0.86. This compared favorably with interobserver correlation between cardiologists (R = 0.84). In categorization of LVF, the weighted agreement between EPs and the primary cardiologist was 84\%, with a weighted kappa of 0.61 (p {$<$} 0.001). Echocardiographic quality was rated by the primary cardiologist as good in 33\%, moderate in 43\%, and poor in 22\%. The EF was significantly lower in patients with a cardiac cause of hypotension vs. other patients (25 {\textpm} 10\% vs. 48 {\textpm} 17\%, p {$<$} 0.001).

The purpose of this article is to present the demographic and motivational factors of adult males who engage in NSSI in a correctional setting. The sample consisted of 42 adult males incarcerated in three New Mexico Prisons who had a history of NSSI. Of the participants, 40\% were Hispanic and 60\% were non-Hispanic. Three measures were used in this study: the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI), the Self-Injury Motivational Scale-II (SIMS-II), and a researcher-created demographic questionnaire. The DSHI was used to examine the types of self-harm, as well as the frequency, severity, and duration of each behavior. The SIMS-II explored 36 potential types of motivations or reasons for self-injurious behavior. Fifteen of the 16 forms of NSSI were endorsed by at least one of the participants. The most predominant type of NSSI reported was cutting (93\%), followed by head banging (78\%), and sticking oneself with sharp objects (71.4\%). Ninety-three percent of the participants required medical attention or hospitalization due to NSSI behaviors. Motivational factors associated with cutting were predominantly mood dysregulation, communication, and addictive qualities.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The purpose of the present study was to investigate microcirculatory blood flow in patients with septic shock treated with levosimendan as compared to an active comparator drug (i.e. dobutamine). The primary end point was a difference of {$\geq$} 20\% in the microvascular flow index of small vessels (MFIs) among groups. Methods: The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial and performed in a multidisciplinary intensive care unit. After achieving normovolemia and a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mmHg, 40 septic shock patients were randomized to receive either levosimendan 0.2 {$\mu$}g{$\cdot$}kg-1{$\cdot$}min-1 (n = 20) or an active comparator (dobutamine 5 {$\mu$}g{$\cdot$}kg-1{$\cdot$}min-1; control; n = 20) for 24 hours. Sublingual microcirculatory blood flow of small and medium vessels was assessed by sidestream dark-field imaging. Microcirculatory variables and data from right heart catheterization were obtained at baseline and 24 hours after randomization. Baseline and demographic data were compared by means of Mann-Whitney rank sum test or chi-square test, as appropriate. Microvascular and hemodynamic variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Results: Microcirculatory flow indices of small and medium vessels increased over time and were significantly higher in the levosimendan group as compared to the control group (24 hrs: MFIm 3.0 (3.0; 3.0) vs. 2.9 (2.8; 3.0); P = .02; MFIs 2.9 (2.9; 3.0) vs. 2.7 (2.3; 2.8); P {$<$} .001). The relative increase of perfused vessel density vs. baseline was significantly higher in the levosimendan group than in the control group (dMFIm 10 (3; 23)\% vs. 0 (-1; 9)\%; P = .007; dMFIs 47 (26; 83)\% vs. 10 (-3; 27); P {$<$} .001). In addition, the heterogeneity index decreased only in the levosimendan group (dHI -93 (-100; -84)\% vs. 0 (-78; 57)\%; P {$<$} .001). There was no statistically significant correlation between systemic and microcirculatory flow variables within each group (each P {$>$} .05). Conclusions: Compared to a standard dose of 5 {$\mu$}g{$\cdot$}kg-1{$\cdot$}min-1 of dobutamine, levosimendan at 0.2 {$\mu$}g{$\cdot$}kg-1{$\cdot$}min-1 improved sublingual microcirculatory blood flow in patients with septic shock, as reflected by changes in microcirculatory flow indices of small and medium vessels.

The aim of this paper is to report the management and the outcomes in 414 patients admitted for suspected ingestion of foreign body between May 1995 and December 1999. METHODS: A plain radiographic film of the neck, chest or abdomen was obtained in the case of radiopaque objects, and in order to rule out suspected perforation: in such cases a computed tomography (CT) study was also performed. All patients were asked to give their informed consent, which was refused by three patients. Anesthesia was always used, either conscious sedation (86.8 \%), or general anesthesia in the case of poor patient tolerance (13.2 \%). All patients underwent an endoscopic procedure within six hours of admission. A flexible scope was used in all patients and a wide range of endoscopic devices was employed. RESULTS: Foreign bodies were found in 64.5 \% of our patients. Almost all were found in the esophagus. The types of foreign body were very different, but they were chiefly food boluses, bones or cartilages, dental prostheses or fish bones. In three patients (1.1 \%) it was impossible to endoscopically remove the foreign body, which was located in the cervical esophagus: all these three patients required surgery. No complications relating to the endoscopic procedure were observed, but 30.7 \% of patients had an underlying esophageal disease, such as a stricture. Only eight patients required a second endoscopic procedure, performed by a more experienced endoscopist. CONCLUSION: Foreign body ingestion represents a frequent reason for emergency endoscopy. The endoscopic procedure is a successful technique which allows the removal of the foreign bodies in almost all cases without significant complications. Surgery is rarely required.},

METHODS: A 30-month-old boy whose eye had been enucleated for  retinoblastoma swallowed his ocular prosthesis on 2 different occasions, and a  32-month-old boy whose eye had also been enucleated for retinoblastoma swallowed  his ocular prosthesis once. RESULTS: In the second child, an abdominal radiograph  was obtained, but the swallowed prosthesis was not apparent, and radiographic  imaging of the recovered prosthesis failed to demonstrate an identifiable object.  In each case, the prosthesis was recovered in the child's stool without incident  several weeks later. Neither child had physical complications as a result of the  swallowing events. CONCLUSIONS: We report 3 instances in which a child fitted for  an ocular prosthesis after enucleation swallowed his prosthesis and had no  untoward effects. The failure of imaging to detect the prostheses in the second  child is attributed to the radiolucent nature of materials used in the  manufacture of the prosthesis. Each of the children was having life stresses in  addition to his medical treatment that may have accounted for his behavior.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hemorrhage is a leading cause of traumatic death. We hypothesized that state-of-the-art feature extraction and machine learning techniques could be used to discover, detect, and continuously trend beat-to-beat changes in arterial pulse waveforms associated with the progression to hemodynamic decompensation. METHODS: We exposed 184 healthy humans to progressive central hypovolemia using lower-body negative pressure to the point of hemodynamic decompensation (systolic blood pressure 9 80 mm Hg with or without bradycardia). Initial models were developed using continuous noninvasive blood pressure waveform data. The resulting algorithm calculates a compensatory reserve index (CRI), where 1 represents supine normovolemia and 0 represents the circulatory volume at which hemodynamic decompensation occurs (i.e., ``running on empty''). Values between 1 and 0 indicate the proportion of reserve remaining before hemodynamic decompensationVmuch like the fuel gauge of a car indicates the amount of fuel remaining in the tank. A CRI estimate is produced after the first 30 heart beats, followed by a new CRI estimate after each subsequent beat. RESULTS: The CRI model with a 30-beat window has an absolute difference between actual and expected time to decompensation of 0.1, with a SD of 0.09. The model distinguishes individuals with low tolerance to reduced central blood volume (i.e., those most likely to develop early shock) from those with high tolerance and are able to estimate how near or far an individual may be from hemodynamic decompensation. CONCLUSION: Machine modeling can quickly and accurately detect and trend central blood volume reduction in real time during the compensatory phase of hemorrhage as well as estimate when an individual is ``running on empty'' and will decompensate (CRI, 0), well in advance of meaningful changes in traditional vital signs.

  abstract = {Background Early, goal-directed therapy (EGDT) is recommended in international guidelines for the resuscitation of patients presenting with early septic shock. However, adoption has been limited, and uncertainty about its effectiveness remains. Methods We conducted a pragmatic randomized trial with an integrated cost-effectiveness analysis in 56 hospitals in England. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either EGDT (a 6-hour resuscitation protocol) or usual care. The primary clinical outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days. Results We enrolled 1260 patients, with 630 assigned to EGDT and 630 to usual care. By 90 days, 184 of 623 patients (29.5\%) in the EGDT group and 181 of 620 patients (29.2\%) in the usual-care group had died (relative risk in the EGDT group, 1.01; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.20; P\,=\,0.90), for an absolute risk reduction in the EGDT group of -0.3 percentage points (95\% CI, -5.4 to 4.7). Increased treatment intensity in the EGDT group was indicated by increased use of intravenous fluids, vasoactive drugs, and red-cell transfusions and reflected by significantly worse organ-failure scores, more days receiving advanced cardiovascular support, and longer stays in the intensive care unit. There were no significant differences in any other secondary outcomes, including health-related quality of life, or in rates of serious adverse events. On average, EGDT increased costs, and the probability that it was cost-effective was below 20\%. Conclusions In patients with septic shock who were identified early and received intravenous antibiotics and adequate fluid resuscitation, hemodynamic management according to a strict EGDT protocol did not lead to an improvement in outcome.

  abstract = {Button batteries (BB) remain a health hazard to children as ingestion might lead to life-threatening complications, especially if the battery is impacted in the esophagus. Worldwide initiatives have been set up in order to prevent and also timely diagnose and manage BB ingestions. A European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) task force for BB ingestions has been founded, which aimed to contribute to reducing the health risks related to this event. It is important to focus on the European setting, next to other worldwide initiatives, to develop and implement effective management strategies. As one of the first initiatives of the ESPGHAN task force, this ESPGHAN position paper has been written. The literature is summarized, and prevention strategies are discussed focusing on some controversial topics. An algorithm for the diagnosis and management of BB ingestions is presented and compared to previous guidelines (NASPGHAN, National Poison Center). In agreement with earlier guidelines, immediate localization of the BB is important and in case of esophageal impaction, the BB should be removed instantly (preferably {$<$}2 hours). Honey and sucralfate can be considered in ingestions {$\leq$}12 hours while waiting for endoscopic removal but should not delay it. In case of delayed diagnosis (first confirmation of the BB on X-ray {$>$}12 hours after ingestion or time point of removal {$>$}12 hours after ingestion) and esophageal impaction the guideline suggests to perform a CT scan in order to evaluate for vascular injury before removing the battery. In delayed diagnosis, even if the battery has passed the esophagus, endoscopy to screen for esophageal damage and a CT scan to rule out vascular injury should be considered even in asymptomatic children. In asymptomatic patients with early diagnosis ({$\leq$}12 hours after ingestion) and position of the BB beyond the esophagus, one can monitor with repeat X-ray (if not already evacuated in stool) in 7 to 14 days, which is different from previous guidelines where repeat X-ray and removal is recommended after 2--4 days and is also based on age. Finally, prevention strategies are discussed in this paper.},

In the present retrospective study, we have tried to analyze the incidence of impacted foreign body in the upper digestive tract at our center.

They are chiefly produced by accidental swallowing of the foreign body in the extremes of age and deliberate attempts in case of psychiatric and criminal background subjects. Varied manifestations of dysphagia, drooling of saliva and retro-sternal pain is presented. Additional symptoms of vomiting and subjective sensation of breathlessness are present occasionally. Removal of foreign body at times is a challenge for the gastrointestinal endoscopist. If not intervened expeditiously, can lead to horrific outcome. In our review study, rigid endoscopy resolved the problem in majority of cases by removal of the foreign body or dislodgement of the impacted fleshy meat ball in to the stomach.

He reported a history of caloric restriction with intentional weight loss followed by a recent increase in caloric intake in the preceding week. His initial presentation was consistent with sepsis from contained sigmoid perforation due to foreign body ingestion, likely a chicken bone. Labs revealed phosphorus {$<$} 1, potassium 2.0, magnesium 1.4, lactate 8.5, WBC 6.1 with 34\% band neutrophils, mild alkalosis (venous pH 7.43), pCO(2) 42, HCO(3) 24. He was admitted to the ICU and received volume resuscitation, IV antibiotics, management of alcohol withdrawal, intravenous phosphate, potassium and magnesium. Repeat labs showed improved phosphorus to 1.9, however serum corrected calcium decreased from 9.5 to 7.5 mg/dL. He continued to receive further repletion of electrolytes with eventual normalization. Discussion: The etiology of this patient's severe hypophosphatemia was multifactorial from chronic alcoholism and refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome was likely present in this case given the patient's malnutrition and weight loss with recent significantly increased caloric intake resulting in severe hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. His generalized muscle weakness can be explained by alcoholism and severe electrolyte derangements. Fortunately, he did not develop respiratory failure which is a complication of severe hypophosphatemia as a result of decreased intracellular ATP. For patients with severe hypophosphatemia ({$<$} 1 mg/dL), IV phosphate repletion is recommended with level monitoring every six hours. This patient developed hypocalcemia in the setting of phosphate repletion, which is a known complication and should be monitored closely.},

Methods---This was a blinded prospective randomized study. The anesthesiologist placed the tracheal tube randomly in the trachea (n = 75) or in the esophagus (n = 75) with direct laryngoscopy. A sonographer identified all tracheal and esophageal intubations. The transducer was placed transversely on the neck just superior to the suprasternal notch. The position of the tracheal tube was determined by the sonographer within 3 seconds of tracheal tube placement in the trachea or in the esophagus. Results---We successfully identified 150 correct tracheal tube placements in tracheas and esophagi, resulting in sensitivity of 100\% (95\% confidence interval, 84\%--100\%) and specificity of 100\% (95\% confidence interval, 84\%--100\%).

  abstract = {Purpose. The etiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of drug-induced hyperthermia (DIH) syndromes are reviewed. Summary. DIH syndromes are a rare and often overlooked cause of body temperature elevation and can be fatal if not recognized promptly and managed appropriately. There are five major DIH syndromes: (1) neuroleptic malignant syndrome, (2) serotonin syndrome, (3) anticholinergic poisoning, (4) sympathomimetic poisoning, and (5) malignant hyperthermia. The differential diagnosis of DIH syndromes can be challenging because symptoms are generally nonspecific, ranging from blood pressure changes and excessive sweating to altered mental status, muscle rigidity, convulsions, and metabolic acidosis. Evidence from the professional literature (per a MEDLINE search for articles published through November 2011) indicates that few currently available treatment options can reduce the duration of hyperthermia; therefore, prompt identification of the provoking agent based on the patient's medication history, the clinical presentation, and the timing of symptom onset is essential to determine the appropriate treatment and mitigate potentially life-threatening sequelae. For all DIH syndromes, appropriate management includes the immediate discontinuation of the suspected offending agent(s) and supportive care (external cooling, volume resuscitation as needed); in some cases, pharmacologic therapy (e.g., a benzodiazepine, bromocriptine, dantrolene) may be appropriate, with the selection of a specific agent primarily determined by the medication history and suspected DIH syndrome. Conclusion. DIH is a hypermetabolic state caused by medications and other agents that alter neurotransmitter levels. The treatment of DIH syndromes includes supportive care and pharmacotherapy as appropriate. Copyright {\copyright} 2013, American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc. All rights reserved.},

Computed tomography of the brain after 1 week demonstrated early abscess  formation in the left frontal operculum and a subdural empyema in the posterior  fossa. The abscesses were evacuated, and the meningitis was treated vigorously  with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Tranexamic acid reduces the risk of bleeding among patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it is unclear whether this leads to improved outcomes. Furthermore, there are concerns that tranexamic acid may have prothrombotic and proconvulsant effects. METHODS In a trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned patients who were scheduled to undergo coronary-artery surgery and were at risk for perioperative complications to receive aspirin or placebo and tranexamic acid or placebo. The results of the tranexamic acid comparison are reported here. The primary outcome was a composite of death and thrombotic complications (nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, renal failure, or bowel infarction) within 30 days after surgery. RESULTS Of the 4662 patients who were enrolled and provided consent, 4631 underwent surgery and had available outcomes data; 2311 were assigned to the tranexamic acid group and 2320 to the placebo group. A primary outcome event occurred in 386 patients (16.7\%) in the tranexamic acid group and in 420 patients (18.1\%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.92; 95\% confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.05; P\,=\,0.22). The total number of units of blood products that were transfused during hospitalization was 4331 in the tranexamic acid group and 7994 in the placebo group (P{$<$}0.001). Major hemorrhage or cardiac tamponade leading to reoperation occurred in 1.4\% of the patients in the tranexamic acid group and in 2.8\% of the patients in the placebo group (P\,=\,0.001), and seizures occurred in 0.7\% and 0.1\%, respectively (P\,=\,0.002 by Fisher's exact test). CONCLUSIONS Among patients undergoing coronary-artery surgery, tranexamic acid was associated with a lower risk of bleeding than was placebo, without a higher risk of death or thrombotic complications within 30 days after surgery. Tranexamic acid was associated with a higher risk of postoperative seizures.

Perforation is defined as a full -thickness tear in the esophageal wall due to a trauma on the esophageal lumen or to a sudden increase of endoluminal pressure, like in spontaneous perforations. The most frequent causes are: iatrogenic injuries, spontaneous perforations, foreign body or caustic ingestion, trauma, tumors etc. The onset of symptoms varies depending on the location of perforation (cervical, intrathoracic or intraabdominal), the degree of tissue destruction and extension of contamination of surrounding organs, the cause, the timing of diagnosis and the presence of underlying esophageal disorders. Post -operative esophageal leaks have a different origin but a quite similar clinical presentation and treatment to esophageal perforations. The higher reported incidence is after cervical esophagogastric anastomosis, followed by intrathoracic anastomosis (above all after trans-hiatal one). It is already proven that short diagnostic timing and correct treatment can reduce mortality of 50\%. Recent evidence also shows how better outcomes are achieved when the management is multidisciplinary, led by an expert team, and individualized treatments are adopted, involving all available modalities (medical, endoscopic and surgical). The purpose of this article is to review current standard practice, expert opinions and outcomes in the management of esophageal perforations and postoperative leaks.},

We reviewed retrospectively the patients' documents, radiological  reports, operative findings and outcome. We also performed a literature search  for all reports of multiple magnets ingestion on MEDLINE and EMBASE. RESULTS:  Daily abdominal radiographs to monitor migration of magnetic objects together  with clinical examination revealed early detection of perforations in two  patients. Explorative laparoscopy and suturing of perforations resulted in a  rapid recovery and good cosmetic appearance. Literature search resulted in 44  published articles with a total of 52 cases of multiple magnet ingestion in  children. CONCLUSIONS: This report stresses the need for prompt follow-up and  early detection of complications in order to operate those patients without  delay.

Mandibular fractures may be treated using open (surgical) and closed (non-surgical) techniques. Fracture sites are immobilized with intermaxillary fixation (IMF) or other external or internal devices (i.e. plates and screws) to allow bone healing. Various techniques have been used, however uncertainty exists with respect to the specific indications for each approach. Objectives The objective of this review is to provide reliable evidence of the effects of any interventions either open (surgical) or closed (non-surgical) that can be used in the management of mandibular fractures, excluding the condyles, in adult patients. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 28 February 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 28 February 2013), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 28 February 2013),  meta Register of Controlled Trials (to 7 April 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (to 7 April 2013) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 7 April 2013). The reference lists of all trials identified were checked for further studies. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials evaluating the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. Any studies that compared different treatment approaches were included. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Results were to be expressed as random-effects models using mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes with 95\% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was to be investigated to include both clinical and methodological factors. Main results Twelve studies, assessed as high (six) and unclear (six) risk of bias, comprising 689 participants (830 fractures), were included. Interventions examined different plate materials and morphology; use of one or two lag screws; microplate versus miniplate; early and delayed mobilization; eyelet wires versus Rapid IMF™ and the management of angle fractures with intraoral access alone or combined with a transbuccal approach. Patient-oriented outcomes were largely ignored and post-operative pain scores were inadequately reported. Unfortunately, only one or two trials with small sample sizes were conducted for each comparison and outcome. Our results and conclusions should therefore be interpreted with caution. We were able to pool the results for two comparisons assessing one outcome. Pooled data from two studies comparing two miniplates versus one miniplate revealed no significant difference in the risk of post-operative infection of surgical site (risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95\% CI 0.41 to 4.22, P = 0.64, I 2  = 0\%). Similarly, no difference in post-operative infection between the use of two 3-dimensional (3D) and standard (2D) miniplates was determined (RR 1.26, 95\% CI 0.19 to 8.13, P = 0.81, I 2  = 27\%). The included studies involved a small number of participants with a low number of events. Authors' conclusions This review illustrates that there is currently inadequate evidence to support the effectiveness of a single approach in the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. The lack of high quality evidence may be explained by clinical diversity, variability in assessment tools used and difficulty in grading outcomes with existing measurement tools. Until high level evidence is available, treatment decisions should continue to be based on the clinician's prior experience and the individual circumstances. Plain language summary Treatments for fractures of the lower jaw Review question The lower jaw (also known as the mandible) is an important bone that shapes the face, holds the lower teeth in place and is used to move the mouth, for talking and chewing food. Fractures are most often found in the part of the lower jaw that supports teeth (known as the body), the part where the jaw curves upwards into the neck (the angle), or at the knobbly-shaped joint found at the very top of the jaw bone (the condyle). Available treatments align and stabilize the fracture, allowing the bone to heal in the proper position. Treatments may or may not involve surgery. This review, produced by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, examines different methods for treating fractures of the body and angle of the mandible in existing research and studies. Background People of all ages can fracture their lower jaw, but fractures mainly occur as a result of violence (for example, being hit or punched in the jaw) or by being involved in an accident on the road (for example, car crashes or bicycle accidents). These fractures can be stabilized by physically binding the jaw shut with a system of bars, wires or elastic bands (intermaxillary fixation), or by using tiny screws or plates attached directly to the fractured sections of the lower jaw bone whilst still allowing the mouth to open (rigid fixation). Study characteristics The evidence on which this review is based is up to date as of 28 February 2013. Twelve studies with a combined total of 689 participants were included in this review. Participants ranged in age from 16 to 68 years and most participants (90\%) were male. All of the studies compared different types of surgical treatments, and each study evaluated a different aspect of surgical treatment such as different types of plates, screws, or wires or how long the jaw was immobilized after surgery. Key results There were concerns about the design and quality of all the studies. All the studies evaluated different aspects of surgical treatment. None of the studies evaluated non-surgical treatments such as intermaxillary fixation and no study compared surgical treatment with non-surgical treatment. As a result there is no clear evidence to indicate which approach is the best to manage these fractures. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence found is poor. Recommendations are made for further well-conducted research studies in this area to be undertaken.},

Despite physical restraint, the tip of his central venous catheter inserted  through the subclavian vein broke and embolized in the right atrium. The embolus  was removed by thoracotomy.

  abstract = {Background: Trauma patients are vulnerable to coagulopathy and inflammatory dysfunction associated with endotheliopathy of trauma (EoT). In vitro evidence has suggested that tranexamic acid (TXA) may ameliorate endotheliopathy. We aimed to investigate how soon after injury EoT occurs, its association with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and whether TXA ameliorates it. Methods: A prospective observational study included 91 trauma patients enrolled within 60 min of injury and 19 healthy controls. Blood was sampled on enrolment and again 4 to 12 h later. ELISAs measured serum concentrations of syndecan-1 and thrombomodulin as biomarkers of EoT. MODS was compared between groups according to biomarker dynamics: persistently abnormal; abnormal to normal; and persistently normal. Timing of EoT was estimated by plotting biomarker data against time, and then fitting generalized additive models. Biomarker dynamics were compared between those who did or did not receive prehospital TXA. Results: Median age was 38 (interquartile range [IQR] 24--55) years; 78 of 91 were male. Median injury severity score (ISS) was 22 (IQR 12--36). EoT was estimated to occur at 5 to 8 min after injury. There were no significant differences in ISS between those with or without prehospital EoT. Forty-two patients developed MODS; 31 of 42 with persistently abnormal; 8 of 42 with abnormal to normal; and 3 of 42 with persistently normal biomarkers; P {$<$} 0.05. There were no significant differences between TXA and non-TXA groups. Conclusions: EoT was present at the scene of injury. MODS was more likely when biomarkers of EoT were persistently raised. There were no significant differences between TXA and non-TXA groups. Prehospital interventions aimed at endothelial restoration may represent a clinically meaningful target for prehospital resuscitation.},

  abstract = {Background: Increased microcirculatory flow and perfusion has been reported to improve clinical outcomes following shock. The optimal resuscitation fluid to restore the flow dynamics of the microcirculation is unknown. This review summarizes the preclinical literature to inform the direction and most important hypotheses for future clinical interventional studies. Methods: Standard systematic review methodology was utilized, and registered with the Collaborative Approach to Meta Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies (CAMARADES). Medline and Embase (via OVID SP) and SCOPUS were searched for all preclinical studies of haemorrhagic shock that compared fluid resuscitation of any kind (e.g., blood products, crystalloids, colloids, or haemoglobin based oxygen carriers) to another fluid or haemorrhage only, and reported at least one microcirculatory physical endpoint (such as flow rate, velocity, vessel diameter, functional capillary density, or glycocalyx thickness). Risk of bias was assessed using the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) tool. Translatability was also assessed for each study based on the most common recommendations. Results: There were 3,103 potential studies of interest, of which 71 studies fulfilled all eligibility criteria. There were 62 rodent, 5 canine, and 4 porcine studies. Flow rate, velocity, and vessel diameter were the most commonly reported endpoints. Studies reported the importance of the presence of haemoglobin, as well as osmotic potential and viscosity in providing optimal restoration of microcirculatory flow dynamics. Others reported the restoration of the endothelial glycocalyx and attenuation of inflammation as important properties for the choice of fluid. All studies were at potential risk of bias due to unclear randomization, concealment, and blinding. There were important threats to translatability for all studies. Conclusion: The ideal resuscitation fluid for restoration of the microcirculation following haemorrhagic shock is likely to contain a preparation of haemoglobin, favor higher oncotic potential, and viscosity, protect and reconstitute the endothelium, and attenuate inflammation. These hypotheses that are derived from preclinical research warrant further exploration in the clinical context.},

These data were used to estimate the potential national requirement for prehospital blood products (PHBP) if evidence from ongoing trials were to report clinical superiority. Setting{\enspace} The Regional Exploration of Standard Care during Evacuation Resuscitation (RESCUER) retrospective observational study was a collaboration between 11 UK air ambulance services. Each was invited to provide up to 5 years of data and total number of taskings during the same period. Participants{\enspace} Patients with hypotensive trauma (systolic blood pressure {$<$}90\,mm Hg or absent radial pulse) attended by a doctor. Primary and secondary outcome measures{\enspace}The primary outcome was the number of patients with hypotensive trauma given prehospital fluids. Secondary outcomes were types and volumes of fluids. These data were combined with published data to estimate potential national eligibility for PHBP. Results{\enspace} Of 29\,037 taskings, 729 (2.5\%) were for patients with hypotensive trauma attended by a physician. Half were aged 21--50 years; 73.4\% were male. A total of 537 out of 729 (73.7\%) were given fluids. Five hundred and ten patients were given a single type of fluid; 27 received {$>$}1\,type. The most common fluid was 0.9\% saline, given to 486/537 (90.5\%) of patients who received fluids, at a median volume of 750 (IQR 300--1500)\,mL. Three per cent of patients received PHBP. Estimated projections for patients eligible for PHBP at these 11 services and in the whole UK were 313 and 794 patients per year, respectively. Conclusions{\enspace} One in 40 air ambulance taskings were manned by physicians to retrievepatients with hypotensive trauma. The most common fluid delivered was 0.9\% saline. If evidence justifies universal provision of PHBP, approximately 800 patients/year would be eligible in the UK, based on our data combined with others published.

  abstract = {Objectives: Echocardiography is a fundamental tool in the diagnosis of acute left ventricular heart failure (aLVHF). However, a consultative exam is not routinely available in every emergency department (ED). The authors investigated the diagnostic performance of emergency Doppler echocardiography (EDecho) performed by emergency physicians (EPs) for the diagnosis of aLVHF in patients with acute dyspnea. Methods: A convenience sample of acute dyspneic patients was evaluated. For each patient, the Boston criteria score for heart failure was calculated, and N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and EDecho were contemporaneously performed. Four investigators, after a limited echocardiography course, performed EDechos and evaluated for a ``restrictive'' pattern on pulsed Doppler analysis of mitral inflow and reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. The final diagnosis, established after reviewing all patient clinical data except NT-proBNP and EDecho results, served as the criterion standard. Results: Among 145 patients, 64 (44\%) were diagnosed with aLVHF. The median time needed to perform EDecho was 4 minutes. Pulsed Doppler analysis was feasible in 125 patients (84\%). The restrictive pattern was more sensitive (82\%) and specific (90\%) than reduced LV ejection fraction and more specific than the Boston criteria and NT-proBNP for the diagnosis of aLVHF. Considering noninterpretable values of the restrictive pattern and uncertain values (``gray areas'') of Boston criteria (4 {$<$} Boston criteria score {$<$} 7) and of NT-proBNP (300 {$<$} NT-proBNP {$<$} 2,200 pg {\textfractionsolidus} mL) as false results, the accuracy of the restrictive pattern in the overall population was 75\%, compared with accuracy of 49\% for both NT-proBNP and Boston criteria. Conclusions: EDecho, particularly pulsed Doppler analysis of mitral inflow, is a rapid and accurate diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with acute dyspnea.

  abstract = {The authors report a case of a schizophrenic patient who repeatedly consumed a wide variety of inedible materials, including significant quantities of tobacco. The phenomenology of this behavior, as well as its psychiatric and medical complications are discussed. It is probable that chronic nicotinism contributed to this patient's refractoriness to psychiatric treatment and to his eventual cardiovascular crisis. The occurrence of pica as a manifestation of severe psychopathology was vividly described by the early pioneers of neuropsychiatry, but has received little attention in recent psychiatric literature. This is in marked contrast to the syndrome of psychogenic water intoxication which continues to be reported frequently. The majority of descriptions of pica have dealt with its occurrence in children, in pregnant women, and as a societal practice in certain cultures studied from a medico-anthropologic point of view. The toxic organic brain syndrome caused by chronic ingestion of nicotine-containing products has also been neglected in psychiatric publications. Descriptions of the neuropsychiatric complications of subacute and chronic nicotinism have been restricted to textbooks of toxicology, where greater emphasis has been given to the acute effects of large quantities of nicotine, often in forms other than tobacco. The following case illustrates the near-fatal practice of tobacco pica in a psychotic patient and dramatically demonstrates the systemic and central nervous system effects of nicotinism.},

One of its primary functions is to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to meet the oxygen demands of tissue cells. Previous data from clinical and experimental studies and the recent development of new imaging modalities, such as Orthogonal Polarization Spectral videomicroscopy and Sidestream Dark Field imaging, have helped to identify the crucial role that microcirculation plays in sepsis. If not corrected, microcirculatory dysfunction can lead to respiratory distress in tissue cells and subsequent organ failure, even in the absence of global hemodynamic deficiency. In the present review, we will address past and recent developments regarding the role of the microcirculation as an important target in the pathogenesis of sepsis and its progression to multiple organ failure. Accordingly, we identify the microcirculation as an important diagnostic and therapeutic target for treatment in sepsis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Afghanistan, a substantial portion of resuscitative combat surgery is performed by US Army forward surgical teams (FSTs). Red blood cells (RBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are available at these facilities, but platelets are not. FST personnel frequently encounter high-acuity patient scenarios without the ability to transfuse platelets. An analysis of the use of fresh whole blood (FWB) at FSTs therefore allows for an evaluation of outcomes associated with this practice. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in prospectively collected data from all transfused patients at six FSTs from December 2005 to December 2010. Univariate analysis was performed, followed by two separate propensity score analyses. In-hospital mortality was predicted with the use of a conditional logistic regression model that incorporated these propensity scores. Subset analysis included evaluation of patients who received uncrossmatched Type O FWB compared with those who received type-specific FWB. RESULTS: A total of 488 patients received a blood transfusion. There were no significant differences in age, sex, or Glasgow Coma Scale in those who received or did not receive FWB. Injury Severity Scores were higher in patients transfused FWB. In our adjusted analyses, patients who received RBCs and FFP with FWB had improved survival compared with those who received RBCs and FFP without FWB. Of 94 FWB recipients, 46 FWB recipients (49\%) were given uncrossmatched Type O FWB, while 48 recipients (51\%) received type-specific FWB. There was no significant difference in mortality between patients that received uncrossmatched Type O and type-specific FWB. CONCLUSIONS: The use of FWB in austere combat environments appears to be safe and is independently associated with improved survival to discharge when compared with resuscitation with RBCs and FFP alone. Mortality was similar for patients transfused uncrossmatched Type O compared with ABO typespecific FWB in an austere setting.},

  abstract = {The term pulmonary aspiration complex represents the various types of pulmonary aspiration based on the nature of the material aspirated. Pulmonary aspiration continues to be an ever-threatening clinical problem even though knowledge of lung defense mechanisms and predisposing factors of aspiration has been advanced to a point which allows identification of patients at risk of suffering pulmonary aspiration. The identification of patients at risk however has not permitted adequate preventive measures from being exercised. This problem persists in part because few of the predisposing factors are reversible or controllable to a degree which would preclude pulmonary aspiration. In addition, the clinical diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration is more often tentative than absolute and based on the clinical setting and changes demonstrated on serial chest radiographs. This situation emphasizes the role of the radiologist and his knowledge of radiographic findings in pulmonary aspiration in suggesting the diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration. The diagnosis may then be confirmed by additional chest radiographs or by bronchoscopy and the retrieval of the aspirated material. An understanding of the pathophysiology of the types of pulmonary aspiration serves to increase the awareness of certain pulmonary complications from aspiration, to select appropriate diagnostic studies, and to institute specific therapy. However, the nature of the material aspirated by a patient may not be obvious initially unless the episode is witnessed and may only be determined in retrospect in some cases. Thus, radiologists play a primary role in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration. Frequently, radiologists must integrate the chest radiographic findings of pulmonary aspiration---the distribution, types of parenchymal opacities, and the expected temporal changes in these opacities, with the patient's clinical situation to establish a diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration (Tables 5, 6). Until recently, therapy of pulmonary aspiration was standardized, pragmatic, and frequently lacked an understanding of the distinct types of pulmonary aspiration. Controversy still surrounds some aspects of therapy. Perhaps, with additional efforts.},

  abstract = {Objective Foreign body ingestion (FBI) occurs infrequently but can be associated with rare risks including perforation. There is limited understanding of the impact of adult FBI in Australia. We aim to evaluate patient characteristics, outcomes and hospital costs of FBI. Design A retrospective cohort study of patients with FBI was performed at a non-prison referral centre in Melbourne, Australia. International Classification of Disease-10 coding identified patients with gastrointestinal FBI over financial years 2018--2021. Exclusion criteria were food bolus, medication foreign body, object in anus or rectum, or non-ingestion. Criteria for `emergent' classification were oesophagus, size {$>$}6 cm, disc batteries, airway compromise, peritonitis, sepsis and/or suspected viscus perforation. Results Thirty-two admissions attributed to 26 patients were included. The median age was 36 years (IQR: 27--56), 58\% were male and 35\% had a prior psychiatric or autism spectrum disorder. There were no deaths, perforations or surgery. Gastroscopy was performed in 16 admissions and 1 was scheduled following discharge. Rat-tooth forceps were used in 31\% and an overtube was used in 3 cases. The median time from presentation to gastroscopy was 673 minutes (IQR: 380--1013). Management was adherent to European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines in 81\%. After excluding admissions with FBI as a secondary diagnosis, median admission cost was \$A1989 (IQR: \$A643--\$A4976) and total admission costs over the 3 years was \$A84 448. Conclusion FBI in an Australian, non-prison referral centre is infrequent, can often be safely managed expectantly, and has limited impact on healthcare utilisation. Early, outpatient endoscopy could be considered for non-urgent cases, which may reduce costs while maintaining safety.},

Here, we present an atypical case of foreign body aspiration. CASE PRESENTATION: An 18-year-old female with major depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder presented for foreign body aspiration. She shared that she uses a box cutter to inflict self-harm and hides it in her mouth. Inadvertently, she aspirated the box cutter and presented to the hospital for the same reason. Besides a mild sore throat, she denied cough, hemoptysis or shortness of breath. She was hemodynamically stable on room air. Her aspiration event was confirmed on a chest x ray, with a blade visualized in the right lower lobe. Pulmonology was consulted emergently with plans for a bronchoscopy the following morning. A CT chest was ordered to confirm the location of the box cutter. Before this was performed, the patient spontaneously expelled the blade by coughing overnight before any intervention took place. The patient did not suffer any consequence. DISCUSSION: Physiologically, the larynx plays a protective role in preventing foreign objects from being aspirated via the closure of the epiglottis, vocal cords and cough reflex (1). In the absence of risk factors, aspiration of foreign objects as in our patient is unlikely. Additionally, aspirated sharp foreign objects are extremely hazardous and pose a risk of catastrophic complications to the airway including hemorrhage, post obstructive pneumonia, lung abscess and bronchiectasis. Emergent intervention using rigid bronchoscopy is warranted as the spontaneous and uneventful expulsion of sharp objects as in our patient, is rare in literature (2). CONCLUSIONS: Foreign body aspiration of sharp objects calls for immediate intervention due to the risk of lethal complications, given that the occurrence of spontaneous and atraumatic expulsion is extremely rare.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Foreign body ingestion (FBI) is a frequent concern in emergency departments. Clinical guidelines recommend performing plain x-rays as the primary  modality of diagnosis. Although point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) has increasingly  been integrated into the daily practice of emergency medicine, it has been poorly  investigated in the diagnostic approach for FBI.This review aims to highlight the  current state of PoCUS use for pediatric FBI.The following research question was  considered in this narrative review: Is PoCUS useful for FBI management? METHODS:  A literature search was conducted to identify articles reporting PoCUS use for  the management of FBI. All articles were assessed for quality by 2 reviewers.  MAIN RESULTS: The 14 selected articles reported 52 FBI cases in which PoCUS  successfully identified and located the ingested FB. Point-of-care ultrasound was  used either as the primary imaging technique or after positive or negative x-ray  findings. In 5 cases (9.6\%), PoCUS was the only modality used for the diagnosis.  Of these cases, 3 (60\%) underwent a successful procedure to remove the FB and 2  (40\%) received conservative treatment without complications. CONCLUSIONS: This  review suggests that PoCUS might be a reliable modality for the initial  management of FBI. PoCUS can locate, identify, and evaluate the size of the FB in  a wide range of materials and gastrointestinal locations. Point-of-care  ultrasound could eventually become the go-to modality in the case of radiolucent  FB, thus avoiding the use of radiation. Further studies are nevertheless required  to validate PoCUS use for FBI management.},

  abstract = {BackgroundSuicide is a leading cause of death worldwide; however, the prevalence and risk factors for the immediate precursors to suicide -- suicidal ideation, plans and attempts -- are not well-known, especially in low- and middle-income countries.AimsTo report on the prevalence and risk factors for suicidal behaviours across 17 countries.MethodA total of 84 850 adults were interviewed regarding suicidal behaviours and socio-demographic and psychiatric risk factors.ResultsThe cross-national lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts is 9.2\% (s.e.=0.1), 3.1\% (s.e.=0.1), and 2.7\% (s.e.=0.1). Across all countries, 60\% of transitions from ideation to plan and attempt occur within the first year after ideation onset. Consistent cross-national risk factors included being female, younger, less educated, unmarried and having a mental disorder. Interestingly, the strongest diagnostic risk factors were mood disorders in high-income countries but impulse control disorders in low- and middle-income countries.ConclusionThere is cross-national variability in the prevalence of suicidal behaviours, but strong consistency in the characteristics and risk factors for these behaviours. These findings have significant implications for the prediction and prevention of suicidal behaviours.},

  abstract = {Esophageal emergencies such as rupture or postoperative leak are uncommon but may be life threatening when they occur. Delay in their diagnosis and treatment may  significantly increase morbidity and mortality. Causes of esophageal injury  include iatrogenic (including esophagogastroduodenoscopy and stent placement),  foreign body ingestion, blunt or penetrating trauma to the chest or abdomen, and  forceful retching, also called Boerhaave syndrome. Although fluoroscopic  esophagography remains the imaging study of choice according the American College  of Radiology appropriateness criteria, CT esophagography has been shown to be at  least equal to if not superior to fluoroscopic evaluation for esophageal injury.  In addition, CT esophagography allows diagnosis of extraesophageal abnormalities,  both as the cause of the patient's symptoms as well as incidental findings. CT  esophagography also allows rapid diagnosis since the examination can be readily  performed in most clinical settings and requires no direct radiologist  supervision, requiring only properly trained technologists and a CT scanner.  Multiple prior studies have shown the limited utility of fluoroscopic  esophagography after a negative chest CT scan and the increase in accuracy after  adding oral contrast agent to CT examinations, although there is considerable  variability of CT esophagography protocols among institutions. Development of a  CT esophagography program, utilizing a well-defined protocol with input from  staff from the radiology, gastroenterology, emergency, and general surgery  departments, can facilitate more rapid diagnosis and patient care, especially in  overnight and emergency settings. The purpose of this article is to familiarize  radiologists with CT esophagography techniques and imaging findings of emergent  esophageal conditions. Online supplemental material is available for this  article. ({\copyright})RSNA, 2021.},

  abstract = {Background: In the later stages of circulatory shock, monitoring should help to avoid fluid overload. In this setting, volume expansion is ideally indicated only for patients in whom the cardiac index (CI) is expected to increase. Crystalloids are usually the choice for fluid replacement. As previous studies evaluating the hemodynamic effect of crystalloids have not distinguished responders from non-responders, the present study was designed to evaluate the duration of the hemodynamic effects of crystalloids according to the fluid responsiveness status. Methods: This is a prospective observational study conducted after the initial resuscitation phase of circulatory shock ({$>$}6 h vasopressor use). Critically ill, sedated adult patients monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter who received a fluid challenge with crystalloids (500 mL infused over 30 min) were included. Hemodynamic variables were measured at baseline (T0) and at 30 min (T1), 60 min (T2), and 90 min (T3) after a fluid bolus, totaling 90 min of observation. The patients were analyzed according to their fluid responsiveness status (responders with CI increase {$>$}15\% and non-responders {$\leq$}15\% at T1). The data were analyzed by repeated measures of analysis of variance. Results: Twenty patients were included, 14 of whom had septic shock. Overall, volume expansion significantly increased the CI: 3.03 {\textpm} 0.64 L/min/m2 to 3.58 {\textpm} 0.66 L/min/m2 (p {$<$} 0.05). From this period, there was a progressive decrease: 3.23 {\textpm} 0.65 L/min/m2 (p {$<$} 0.05, T2 versus T1) and 3.12 {\textpm} 0.64 L/min/m2 (p {$<$} 0.05, period T3 versus T1). Similar behavior was observed in responders (13 patients), 2.84 {\textpm} 0.61 L/min/m2 to 3.57 {\textpm} 0.65 L/min/m2 (p {$<$} 0.05) with volume expansion, followed by a decrease, 3.19 {\textpm} 0.69 L/min/m2 (p {$<$} 0.05, T2 versus T1) and 3.06 {\textpm} 0.70 L/min/m2 (p {$<$} 0.05, T3 versus T1). Blood pressure and cardiac filling pressures also decreased significantly after T1 with similar findings in both responders and non-responders. Conclusions: The results suggest that volume expansion with crystalloids in patients with circulatory shock after the initial resuscitation has limited success, even in responders.},

Presentation of case A 29-year-old prisoner presented to the Emergency Department with vomiting, ten hours after he claimed to have swallowed a mobile phone. Clinical examination was unremarkable. Both initial and repeat abdominal radiographs eight hours later confirmed that the foreign body remained in situ in the stomach and had not progressed along the gastrointestinal tract. Based on these findings, upper endoscopy was performed under general anaesthesia. The object could not be aligned correctly to accommodate endoscopic removal using current retrieval devices. Following unsuccessful endoscopy, an upper midline laparotomy was performed and the phone was delivered through an anterior gastrotomy, away from the pylorus. The patient made an uneventful recovery and underwent psychological counselling prior to discharge. Discussion In this case report, the use of endoscopy in the management when a conservative approach fails is questioned. Can the current endoscopic retrieval devices be improved to limit the need for surgical interventions in future cases? Conclusion An ingested mobile phone in the stomach may not be amenable for removal using the current endoscopic retrieval devices. Improvements in overtubes or additional modifications of existing retrieval devices to ensure adequate alignment for removal without injuring the oesophagus are needed.},

On the other hand, perforation and abscess formation as complications of FB ingestion are rare. Their presentation is not clinically different from other causes of peritonitis and differential diagnosis is sometimes difficult. The most common cause of FB perforation is due to fish bone ingestion. We present two consecutive cases of complications associated to fish bone ingestion. In the first case, patient had diffused abdominal pain, without laboratory considerable signs of inflammation. Computer tomography (CT) scan evidenced ileal perforation due to a probable FB; in the second case patient presented abdominal pain, leukocytosis and elevated CRP. The CT scan revealed presence of abscess and omental inflammation near ileum. Both patients submitted surgery. In the first case, an enterotomy was done, in the second case omentectomy and abdominal cleaning were performed. Surprisingly, In the second case, the patient claimed for damages in the high suspicion for a medical error occurred in a previous operation. Fortunately, the specimen exam revealed the truth. Complications due to FBs ingestion must be adequately recognized and rapidly treated. Radiological tools, especially ultrasonography and CT scan, can be useful to make diagnosis but sometimes this is reached only at the time of intervention.},

Colonoscopic retrieval was unsuccessful. A subsequent laparotomy revealed a chronically inflamed thickened terminal ileum with mesenteric fat encroachment necessitating a right hemicolectomy. Histopathological analysis confirmed Crohn's disease with impaction of the 20-pence coin in a distal terminal ileum stricture near the ileo-caecal valve. LEARNING POINT: Gastrointestinal foreign body retention should alert the clinician to the presence of an undiagnosed bowel abnormality. Furthermore, failed endoscopic retrieval should be considered as a marker for potential underlying gastrointestinal pathology and a requirement for operative intervention. CONCLUSION: This case describes a rare presentation of Crohn's disease and highlights the need to consider underlying gastrointestinal pathology in patients presenting with a deteriorating clinical condition in the presence of an incidental foreign body.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six U.S. copper-based pre-1982 pennies, 12 zinc-based post-1982 pennies, a quarter, a nickel, and a dime were exposed to postprandial concentrations of gastric acid (0.15N HCl) for 7 days, and radiographs were obtained daily. Half the zinc-based coins were scraped to disrupt their copper coating. Coins were weighed at the start and completion of the study. RESULTS: Post-1982 zinc-based pennies developed radiolucent corrosive changes within 24 hours. Erosions on the coins became more apparent over time. Frank holes were present on day 2. The weights of these coins decreased 5\%-8\% during the study. Pre-1982 copper pennies and silver-colored coins showed no change on radiographs over 7 days. CONCLUSION: Unexpected radiolucent corrosions may develop in post-1982 zinc alloy pennies when retained in the stomach. Coins have long been considered innocuous foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tracts of children. However, because of the potential for ulceration and zinc-related morbidity, closer clinical and radiographic observation is warranted. Coins with scalloped edges or holes should be endoscopically removed, as they have likely been retained longer than 1 or 2 days.},

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a low density area with enhancement  in the mediastinum, especially around the esophageal wall. We planned to perform  surgical drainage with the intention of performing intraoperative endoscopy from  the beginning. We performed surgical drainage through a left cervical oblique  incision; however, there was no exudate obtained from the mediastinal space.

  abstract = {Purpose of the study: IV line insertion and drugs did not affect long-term survival in an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) randomized clinical trial (RCT). In a previous large registry study adrenaline was negatively associated with survival from OHCA. The present post hoc analysis on the RCT data compares outcomes for patients actually receiving adrenaline to those not receiving adrenaline. Materials and methods: : Patients from a RCT performed May 2003 to April 2008 were included. Three patients from the original intention-to-treat analysis were excluded due to insufficient documentation of adrenaline administration. Quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and clinical outcomes were compared. Results: Clinical characteristics were similar and CPR quality comparable and within guideline recommendations for 367 patients receiving adrenaline and 481 patients not receiving adrenaline. Odds ratio (OR) for being admitted to hospital, being discharged from hospital and surviving with favourable neurological outcome for the adrenaline vs. no-adrenaline group was 2.5 (CI 1.9, 3.4), 0.5 (CI 0.3, 0.8) and 0.4 (CI 0.2, 0.7), respectively. Ventricular fibrillation, response interval, witnessed arrest, gender, age and endotracheal intubation were confounders in multivariate logistic regression analysis. OR for survival for adrenaline vs. no-adrenaline adjusted for confounders was 0.52 (95\% CI: 0.29, 0.92). Conclusion: Receiving adrenaline was associated with improved short-term survival, but decreased survival to hospital discharge and survival with favourable neurological outcome after OHCA. This post hoc survival analysis is in contrast to the previous intention-to-treat analysis of the same data, but agrees with previous non-randomized registry data. This shows limitations of non-randomized or non-intention-totreat analyses.},

Methods: Adult non-traumatic cardiac arrests treated by Oslo EMS between May 2003 and April 2008 were prospectively registered. Patients were categorized according to being treated by the physician-manned ambulance (PMA) or by regular paramedic-manned ambulances (non-PMA). Patient records and continuous electrocardiograms (ECGs) with impedance signals were reviewed. Quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and clinical outcomes were compared. Results: Resuscitation was attempted in 1128 cardiac arrests, of which 151 treated by non-PMA and PMA together were excluded from comparative analysis. Of the remaining 977 patients, 232 (24\%) and 741 (76\%) were treated by PMA and non-PMA, respectively. The PMA group was more likely to have bystander witnessed arrests and initial VF/VT, and received better CPR quality with shorter hands-off intervals and pre-shock pauses, and having a greater proportion of patients being intubated. Despite uneven distribution of positive prognostic factors and better CPR quality, short-term and long-term survival were not different for patients treated by the PMA vs. non-PMA, with 34\% vs. 33\% (p = 0.74) achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), 28\% vs. 25\% (p = 0.50) being admitted to ICU and 13\% vs. 11\% (p = 0.28) being discharged from hospital, respectively.

The concordance between RTMUS and POCUS in the evaluation of critically ill patients has not been reported. This study sought to evaluate the concordance between RTMUS and POCUS for the cardiopulmonary evaluation of patients in acute respiratory insufficiency and/ or shock. Methods: Ultrasound-na{\textasciidieresis}Ive nurses performed RTMUS on critically ill patients. Concordance between RTMUS and POCUS (performed by critical care fellows) in the evaluation of the heart and lungs was reported. The test characteristics of RTMUS were calculated using POCUS as a gold standard. Concordance between RTMUS and available transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and computed tomography (CT) scans was also reported. Results: Twenty patients were enrolled. Concordance between RTMUS and POCUS was good (90\%-100\%) for left ventricle function, right ventricle (RV) dilatation/ dysfunction, pericardial effusion, lung sliding, pulmonary interstitial syndrome, pleural effusion, and fair (80\%) for lung consolidation. Concordance between RTMUS and TTE or CT was similar. RTMUS was highly specific (88\%-100\%) for all abnormalities evaluated and highly sensitive (89\%-100\%) for most abnormalities although sensitivity for the detection of RV dilatation/dysfunction (33\%) and pulmonary interstitial syndrome (71\%) was negatively impacted by false negatives. Conclusions: RTMUS may be a reasonable substitute for POCUS in the cardiopulmonary evaluation of patients with acute respiratory insufficiency and/or shock. These findings should be validated on a larger scale.},

  abstract = {The current occurrence of twin births is beyond previous generational records. Many countries in the world have records that confirm a significant increase in twin births from the 1980s; out of forty two individuals born, one is a twin which gives rise to the birth of one million and six hundred thousand children per year. This implies that, the mean global rise in twin birthrate is one-third over the past four decades. In 2022, Africa had the highest rate of naturally conceived twin births from two different eggs with 80\% of twin births recorded in Africa or Asia. Igbo-Ora, a Yoruba town in Oyo state, Nigeria is currently tagged ``the melting pot of twin birth'' due to the multiple birth record of twins and triplets in virtually every household believed to be due to their environment or the food they eat, making the town ``the world's twin capital''. Multiple pregnancies occur when a female carries two or more babies in her womb. The aim of the study was to review some Nigerian plants claimed to have chances of increasing multiple pregnancies in women and determine their responsible bioactive constituents. Articles published in English were gathered electronically from database such as PubMed and Medline using scientific keywords such as multiple pregnancies and multiple births, and terms like nutrients, dietary, supplements and genetics. Medical articles such as randomized controlled trials and guidelines from the Food and Agricultural Organization, World Health Organization, United Nation University Press, and peered reviewed Journals, locally and internationally were consulted. Individuals that are well recognized to have wealth of knowledge and scientific training in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, and Traditional Birth Attendance were sought for professional advice. Descriptive analysis was employed. Relevant data and useful information were compiled and taken as results. The study lasted for six months; from January to June, 2023. Foods such as yam, cassava, okra leaf, beans, grains, maca root, pineapple, dairy products, fruits and vegetables were determined and found to contain bioactive constituents such as phytoestrogen, gonadotropin, insulin-like proteins, follicle stimulating and luteinizing hormones, complex carbohydrates, an enzyme-bromelain, zinc and folic acid that could increase the chances of multiple pregnancies. Other contributory factors include the age, height, weight genetics and race of the mothers.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We present the results of the autopsy of a retired professional football player that revealed neuropathological changes consistent with long-term repetitive concussive brain injury. This case draws attention to the need for further studies in the cohort of retired National Football League players to elucidate the neuropathological sequelae of repeated mild traumatic brain injury in professional football. METHODS: The patient's premortem medical history included symptoms of cognitive impairment, a mood disorder, and parkinsonian symptoms. There was no family history of Alzheimer's disease or any other head trauma outside football. A complete autopsy with a comprehensive neuropathological examination was performed on the retired National Football League player approximately 12 years after retirement. He died suddenly as a result of coronary atherosclerotic disease. Studies included determination of apolipoprotein E genotype. RESULTS: Autopsy confirmed the presence of coronary atherosclerotic disease with dilated cardiomyopathy. The brain demonstrated no cortical atrophy, cortical contusion, hemorrhage, or infarcts. The substantia nigra revealed mild pallor with mild dropout of pigmented neurons. There was mild neuronal dropout in the frontal, parietal, and temporal neocortex. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy was evident with many diffuse amyloid plaques as well as sparse neurofibrillary tangles and ␶-positive neuritic threads in neocortical areas. There were no neurofibrillary tangles or neuropil threads in the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex. Lewy bodies were absent. The apolipoprotein E genotype was E3/E3. CONCLUSION: This case highlights potential long-term neurodegenerative outcomes in retired professional National Football League players subjected to repeated mild traumatic brain injury. The prevalence and pathoetiological mechanisms of these possible adverse long-term outcomes and their relation to duration of years of playing football have not been sufficiently studied. We recommend comprehensive clinical and forensic approaches to understand and further elucidate this emergent professional sport hazard.},

  abstract = {Most ingested foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract without giving rise to complications. The possibility of penetration of the intestinal tract, by sharp, pointed objects, however, necessitates careful and continued observation. If such objects become lodged in a narrow segment of the gastrointestinal tract, perforation may occur. The resulting morbidity depends on the further route of the penetrating object and whether septic sequelae ensue. Although foreign bodies may migrate to almost any intraabdominal organ, perforation of the duodenum and migration into the liver are extremely rare. A case of a woman who unknowingly ingested a pin that perforated the duodenum causing only few acute symptoms is presented. Biliary tract pathology was suspected, but ultrasound examination ruled it out. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed a pin thrust into the liver, with the head of the pin in the wall of the duodenum. Traditional surgical treatment requires laparotomy for foreign body removal. In the reported case, the pin was removed laparoscopically. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient left the hospital on day 2 after the procedure. With laparoscopic approach for removal of penetrating intestinal foreign bodies, laparotomy and its attending complications are avoided. This approach is less invasive, has a beneficial impact on postoperative pain, produces a better cosmetic result, and offers a faster return to normal activities. Hospital stay and costs also are reduced.},

  abstract = {Background Dizygotic (DZ, non-identical) twinning rates vary widely across different regions in the world. With a DZ twinning rate of 45 per 1000 live births, Igbo-Ora Community in South-west Nigeria has the highest dizygotic (DZ) twinning rate in the world. Although several postulations exist on the causes of high DZ twinning rates in Igbo-Ora, no study has yet been conclusive on a definite causative agent. Objective Using qualitative methods, this study explored the perceptions and beliefs of Igbo-Ora residents about the causes of high DZ twinning rates. Methods Focus group discussion sessions and key informant interviews were organized among fathers and mothers of twins, those without twins, and health care providers. Key informant interviews were also held with persons considered to be custodians of culture who may have knowledge relevant to twinning such as traditional rulers, and traditional birth attendants; as well as health care providers, mothers and fathers of twins, and adult twins. Results The results showed three factors featuring as the leading perceived causes of twinning in the community. These included twinning being an act of God, hereditary, and being due to certain foods consumed in the community. Contrary to reports that the consumption of a species of yam (Dioscorea rotundata) may be responsible for the DZ twinning in this Community; yam was not prioritized by the respondents as associated with twinning. In contrast, participants repeatedly mentioned the consumption of ``ilasa'' a soup prepared with okra leaves (Abelmoschus esculenta) with water that is obtained from the community, and ``amala'' a local delicacy produced from cassava (Manihot esculenta) as the most likely dietary factors responsible for twinning in the community. Conclusion Since the same foods are consumed in neighboring communities that have lower rates of twinning, we conjecture that nutritional and other environmental factors may produce epigenetic modifications that influence high DZ twinning rates in Igbo-Ora community. We conclude that more directed scientific studies based on these findings are required to further elucidate the etiology of the high rate of DZ twinning in Igbo-Ora.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Excessive sympathoadrenal activation in critical illness contributes directly to organ damage, and high concentrations of catecholamines damage the vascular endothelium. This study investigated associations between potential drivers of sympathoadrenal activation, circulating catecholamines and biomarkers of endothelial damage and outcome in ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)-patients, hypothesizing that the catecholamine surge would reflect shock degree and correlate with biomarkers of endothelial damage. METHODS: This was a prospective study of 678 consecutive STEMI-patients admitted to a single high-volume invasive heart centre for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) from September 2006 to July 2008. Blood samples were drawn immediately before pPCI. Plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, syndecan-1 and thrombomodulin were measured retrospectively with complete data in 571 patients (84\%). Median follow-up time was 28 (IQR 23 to 34) months. Follow-up was 99.7\% complete. Outcomes were all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, re-myocardial infarction and admission due to heart failure. RESULTS: Circulating noradrenaline and adrenaline correlated weakly but independently with syndecan-1 (rho = 0.15 and rho = 0.13, both P {$<$}0.01) and thrombomodulin (rho = 0.11 and rho = 0.17, both P {$<$}0.01), biomarkers of glycocalyx and endothelial cell damage, respectively. Considering biomarkers, patients with shock pre-pPCI had higher adrenaline and syndecan-1 and patients admitted to ICU post-pPCI had higher syndecan-1 (all P {$<$}0.05), and in the patients with shock (n = 51) catecholamines correlated strongly with thrombomodulin and syndecan-1 (rho = 0.31 to 0.42, all P {$<$}0.05). During follow-up, 78 (14\%) patients died (37 cardiovascular deaths) and 65 (11\%) were admitted with heart failure. By multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses, one quartile higher plasma adrenaline was weakly but independently associated with both 30-day and long term mortality and heart failure (30-day all-cause mortality hazard ratio (95\% CI) 1.39 (1.01 to 1.92), P = 0.046; 30-day heart failure 1.65 (1.17 to 2.34), P = 0.005; and long-term cardiovascular mortality 1.49 (1.08 to 2.04), P = 0.014). Furthermore, one quartile higher syndecan-1 was also weakly but independently associated with long-term all cause mortality (1.26 (1.02 to 1.57), P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: In STEMI patients treated with pPCI, catecholamines correlated weakly with biomarkers of endothelial damage, with the strongest correlations and highest adrenaline and syndecan-1 levels in patients with shock. Furthermore, adrenaline and syndecan-1 were weakly but independently associated with mortality and heart failure. Acute myocardial infarction appears to cause significant endothelial cell and glycocalyx injury and a parallel increase in circulating catecholamines.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Intentional ingestions of foreign objects (IIFO) continue to be prevalent among prisoners. Our previous research examined determinants of hospital admission, endoscopy, and surgery among prisoners who ingest foreign objects. However, little is known about the financial impact of these events on healthcare facilities that service the prisoner population. This study aims to fill this gap by examining hospital charges attributable to 435 prisoner episodes of IIFO. Methods: A retrospective review of all prisoners who presented to our medical center with the complaint of IIFO was conducted. Both Institutional Review Board and Bureau of Prisons approvals were obtained before data collection. All prisoners ages 18-75 were included between the dates of January 2004 and December 2011. Episodes were divided into three categories: (a) Unverified IIFO wherein ingested object was claimed by the patient but never identified; (b) verified IIFO wherein ingested object was clearly identified; (c) secondary events due to direct complications of previous IIFO episode (s). The temporal occurrence of IIFO was organized by increasing the number of episodes and grouped accordingly. Detailed list of hospital charges was obtained for every IIFO episode including: (a) emergency services, (b) procedures, (c) laboratory, (d) surgical supplies, (e) allied health services, (f) radiology studies, (g) anesthesiology charges, (h) pharmacy, and (h) intensive care costs. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze basic data. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine differences among nonnormally distributed variables and sub-groups. Statistical significance set at alpha = 0.05. Results: A total of 435 IIFO episodes occurred during the study period in a population of 125 patients (mean age 33.8 +/- 11.7 years, median age 34 [range 19-75] years, 92.8\% male). Hospital charges associated with these episodes totaled \$6,209,557. There were 94 unverified IIFOs, 332 verified IIFOs, and 9 secondary events. Verified IIFOs were associated with significantly greater median charges (\$5,860) than unverified IIFOs (\$3,997) and secondary events carried lower cost (\$3,501) than the former two (P {$<$} 0.01). We also observed a pattern of escalating costs associated with increasing number of sequential IIFO episodes, with the 1st episode carrying median charges of \$4,683 and episodes numbered 11+ carrying median charges of \$7,698 (P {$<$} 0.01). Conclusions: Hospital charges associated with the care of prisoners who ingest foreign objects tend to escalate over time. Although charges in most of the categories demonstrated increases with greater numbers of ingestions, the largest contributors to this pattern of escalating charges included radiology, pharmacy, hospital room charges, and surgical services. These findings suggest that early intervention in the destructive cycle of IIFO may not only improve patient outcomes but also result in savings to the healthcare system.

  abstract = {Background: Although thoracic ultrasonography accurately determines the size and extent of occult pneumothoraces (PTXs) in spontaneously breathing patients, there is uncertainty about patients receiving positive pressure ventilation. We compared the lung point (ie, the area where the collapsed lung still adheres to the inside of the chest wall) using the two modalities ultrasonography and CT scanning to determine whether ultrasonography can be used reliably to assess PTX progression in a positive-pressure-ventilated porcine model. Methods: Air was introduced in incremental steps into five hemithoraces in three intubated porcine models. The lung point was identified on ultrasound imaging and referenced against the lateral limit of the intrapleural air space identified on the CT scans. The distance from the sternum to the lung point (S-LP) was measured on the CT scans and correlated to the insufflated air volume. Results: The mean total difference between the 131 ultrasound and CT scan lung points was 6.8 mm (SD, 7.1 mm; range, 0.0-29.3 mm). A mixed-model regression analysis showed a linear relationship between the S-LP distances and the PTX volume (P , .001). Conclusions: In an experimental porcine model, we found a linear relation between the PTX size and the lateral position of the lung point. The accuracy of thoracic ultrasonography for identifying the lung point (and, thus, the PTX extent) was comparable to that of CT imaging. These clinically relevant results suggest that ultrasonography may be safe and accurate in monitoring PTX progression during positive pressure ventilation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the last decade the age of trauma patients and injury mortality has increased. At the same time, many centers have implemented multiple interventions focused on improved hemorrhage control, effectively resulting in a bleeding control bundle of care. The objective of our study was to analyze the temporal distribution of trauma-related deaths, the factors that characterize that distribution and how those factors have changed over time at our urban level 1 trauma center. METHODS: Records at an urban Level 1 trauma center were reviewed. Two time periods (2005-2006 and 2012-2013) were included in the analysis. Mortality rates were directly adjusted for age, gender and mechanism of injury. The Mann-Whitney and chi square tests were used to compare variables between periods, with significance set at 0.05. RESULTS: 7080 patients (498 deaths) were examined in 2005-2006, while 8767 patients (531 deaths) were reviewed in 2012-2013. The median age increased 6 years, with a similar increase in those who died. In patients that died, no differences by gender, race or ethnicity were observed. Fall-related deaths are now the leading cause of death. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and hemorrhage accounted for\,{$>$}91\% of all deaths. TBI (61\%) and multiple organ failure or sepsis (6.2\%) deaths were unchanged, while deaths associated with hemorrhage decreased from 36\% to 25\% (p{$<$}0.01). Across time periods, 26\% of all deaths occurred within one hour of hospital arrival, while 59\% occurred within 24h. Unadjusted mortality dropped from 7.0\% to 6.1 (p=0.01) and in-hospital mortality dropped from 6.0\% to 5.0\% (p{$<$}0.01). Adjusted mortality dropped 24\% from 7.6\% (95\% CI: 6.9-8.2) to 5.8\% (95\% CI: 5.3-6.3) and in-hospital mortality decreased 30\% from 6.6\% (95\% CI: 6.0-7.2) to 4.7 (95\% CI: 4.2-5.1). CONCLUSIONS: Over the same time frame of this study, increases in trauma death across the globe have been reported. This single-site study demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality, attributable to decreased hemorrhagic death. It is possible that efforts focused on hemorrhage control interventions (a bleeding control bundle) resulted in this reduction. These changing factors provide guidance on future prevention and intervention efforts.},

  abstract = {Background Recent debate concerns the most appropriate definition of hypotension. Some have advocated raising the systolic blood pressure (BP) threshold to 110 mm Hg while others favor 80 mm Hg. Hypothesis The optimal definition of hypotension differs by age group. Design An analysis was performed of trauma victims 18 years and older in the National Trauma Data Bank, excluding burn injury patients and those with incomplete data. Setting Injured patients who were hospitalized in various trauma centers across the continental United States. Patients Three age groups were identified for analysis as follows: 18 to 35 years, 36 to 64 years, and 65 years and older. One hundred one multiple logistic regression analyses were performed for each population. Hypotension was sequentially defined as an emergency department systolic BP (SBP) of 50 to 150 mm Hg to see which model best predicted mortality, adjusting for demographic and injury covariates. The discriminatory power of each model was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. Optimally defined hypotension was identified as the model with the highest AUROC curve. Main Outcomes Measure In-hospital mortality. Results A total of 902 852 patients (median age, 44 years; 66.2\% men) were analyzed. Overall mortality was 4.1\%. Optimal emergency department SBP cutoff values for hypotension were 85 mm Hg for patients aged 18 to 35 years, 96 mm Hg for patients aged 36 to 64 years, and 117 mm Hg for elderly patients. Conclusions For patients younger than 65 years, the classic definition of hypotension as an emergency department SBP less than 90 mm Hg remains optimal. With increasing involvement of elderly individuals in trauma and their peculiarity as a comorbid state, there is a need to redefine what is presently defined as a cutoff value for hypotension in elderly patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether catheter ablation is more effective than conventional medical therapy for improving outcomes in AF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Catheter Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation trial is an investigator-initiated, open-label, multicenter, randomized trial involving 126 centers in 10 countries. A total of 2204 symptomatic patients with AF aged 65 years and older or younger than 65 years with 1 or more risk factors for stroke were enrolled from November 2009 to April 2016, with follow-up through December 31, 2017. INTERVENTIONS The catheter ablation group (n = 1108) underwent pulmonary vein isolation, with additional ablative procedures at the discretion of site investigators. The drug therapy group (n = 1096) received standard rhythm and/or rate control drugs guided by contemporaneous guidelines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was a composite of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. Among 13 prespecified secondary end points, 3 are included in this report: all-cause mortality; total mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization; and AF recurrence. RESULTS Of the 2204 patients randomized (median age, 68 years; 37.2\% female; 42.9\% had paroxysmal AF and 57.1\% had persistent AF), 89.3\% completed the trial. Of the patients assigned to catheter ablation, 1006 (90.8\%) underwent the procedure. Of the patients assigned to drug therapy, 301 (27.5\%) ultimately received catheter ablation. In the intention-to-treat analysis, over a median follow-up of 48.5 months, the primary end point occurred in 8.0\% (n = 89) of patients in the ablation group vs 9.2\% (n = 101) of patients in the drug therapy group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86 [95\% CI, 0.65-1.15]; P = .30). Among the secondary end points, outcomes in the ablation group vs the drug therapy group, respectively, were 5.2\% vs 6.1\% for all-cause mortality (HR, 0.85 [95\% CI, 0.60-1.21]; P = .38), 51.7\% vs 58.1\% for death or cardiovascular hospitalization (HR, 0.83 [95\% CI, 0.74-0.93]; P = .001), and 49.9\% vs 69.5\% for AF recurrence (HR, 0.52 [95\% CI, 0.45-0.60]; P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with AF, the strategy of catheter ablation, compared with medical therapy, did not significantly reduce the primary composite end point of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. However, the estimated treatment effect of catheter ablation was affected by lower-than-expected event rates and treatment crossovers, which should be considered in interpreting the results of the trial.},

  abstract = {Background: Providing supplemental oxygen is fundamental in the management of mechanically ventilated patients. Increasing amounts of data show worse clinical outcomes associated with hyperoxia. However, these previous data in the critically ill have not focused on outcomes associated with brief hyperoxia exposure immediately after endotracheal intubation. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of isolated early hyperoxia exposure in the emergency department (ED) on clinical outcomes among mechanically ventilated patients with subsequent normoxia in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: This was an observational cohort study conducted in the ED and ICUs of an academic center in the USA. Mechanically ventilated normoxic (partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) 60-120 mm Hg) ICU patients with mechanical ventilation initiated in the ED were studied. The cohort was categorized into three oxygen exposure groups based on PaO2 values obtained after ED intubation: hypoxia, normoxia, and hyperoxia (defined as PaO2{$<$}60 mmHg, PaO2 60-120 mm Hg, and PaO2{$>$}120 mm Hg, respectively, based on previous literature). Results: A total of 688 patients were included. ED normoxia occurred in 350 (50.9\%) patients, and 300 (43.6\%) had exposure to ED hyperoxia. The ED hyperoxia group had a median (IQR) ED PaO2 of 189 mm Hg (146-249), compared to an ED PaO2 of 88 mm Hg (76-101) in the normoxia group, P{$<$}0.001. Patients with ED hyperoxia had greater hospital mortality (29.7\%), when compared to those with normoxia (19.4\%) and hypoxia (13.2\%). After multivariable logistic regression analysis, ED hyperoxia was an independent predictor of hospital mortality (adjusted OR 1.95 (1.34-2.85)). Conclusions: ED exposure to hyperoxia is common and associated with increased mortality in mechanically ventilated patients achieving normoxia after admission. This suggests that hyperoxia in the immediate post-intubation period could be particularly injurious, and targeting normoxia from initiation of mechanical ventilation may improve outcome.},

Coins and chicken or fish bones were the most common objects ingested. In 27 (4\%) children, the FB had been expelled or removed before arrival, and in a further 133 (20\%), no FB could be identified. Three patients required emergency airway management. Less than 50\% of the children presenting with dysphagia or vomiting had identifiable FBs lodged in the oropharynx or proximal oesophagus, whilst 22\% of the children with FBs requiring removal from these sites were asymptomatic. Oesophageal FBs were removed under direct vision (six cases), by rigid oesophagoscopy under general anaesthetic (77 cases), or using a balloon catheter under sedation (26 cases). All 224 FBs detected in the stomach or beyond were allowed to pass naturally, and delayed passage occurred in only one case. Passage of 11 alkaline disc batteries occurred without complication. No patient required surgical removal of an FB.},

A total of 353 MWDs (215 males and 138 females; mean age, 6 {\textpm} 3  years) were analyzed in this study. Among Korean MWDs, gastrointestinal (GI)  disorders are the most frequently diagnosed, followed by dental and  musculoskeletal disorders. Foreign body (FB) ingestion had the highest prevalence  of GI disorders, with the most common FB being a leather collar or leash. General  and dental surgeries, including removal of gastric FB and tooth extraction, were  routinely performed at the AFMRI. Preventative care focusing on dental disease  and FB ingestion may be helpful for effective performance and good quality of  life in MWDs, with the regular assessment and prevention of environmental factors  that may contribute to behavioral problems such as FB ingestion, coprophagy, and  anorexia.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fish bone (FB) is one of the common causes of foreign body impaction in the pharynx and esophagus. PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of 64-slice  multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) for the evaluation of pharynx and upper  esophageal FB foreign bodies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-six patients with  suspected FB foreign body ingestion were examined by plain radiography (n\,=\,40)  and unenhanced MDCT (n\,=\,66). We analyzed the presence, location, size, shape,  and lying position of the foreign bodies. RESULTS: On MDCT, 46 foreign bodies  were detected. Among them, 45 were confirmed by endoscopy. The sensitivity of  MDCT for the detection of foreign bodies was 100\%, which was superior to that of  the plain radiography (51.7\%). The location of the foreign bodies was most common  in the upper esophagus (n\,=\,22, 47.8\%), followed by pharyngoesophageal junction  (n\,=\,10, 21.7\%), transjunctional (n\,=\,7, 15.2\%), hypopharynx (n\,=\,5, 10.9\%), and  oropharynx (n\,=\,2, 4.3\%). Their longest length was 5.3-40.1\,mm (mean, 21.3\,mm).  Thirty-three FBs (71.7\%) were linear and 13 (28.3\%) were flat in shape. They  showed transverse (n\,=\,23, 50.0\%), parallel (n\,=\,13, 28.3\%), and oblique  positions (n\,=\,10, 21.7\%) to the long axis of the pharynx and esophagus,  respectively. CONCLUSION: MDCT is useful for the evaluation of the pharynx and  upper esophageal FB foreign bodies.},

CASE SUMMARY: A 45-year-old man presented to the emergency  department with severe abdominal pain after the deliberate ingestion of 200\,cm(3)  of polyurethane mixed with methylene diphenyl diisocyanate and urethane primers.  On an initial laparoscopic examination, foreign material was observed in the  peritoneal space with haemoperitoneum. Emergency exploration was then undertaken  for suspected gastric perforation. Full-thickness damage was identified on the  stomach wall during the operation. The material in the gastrointestinal tract and  peritoneal space was gently removed. Moulded casts of the entire stomach and  distal oesophagus were extracted successfully. The patient was discharged 14~days  after surgery. IMAGES: Computed tomography revealed foreign material occupying  the entire gastric chamber, as well as diffuse gastric perforation. CONCLUSIONS:  Life-threatening gastric perforation can occur after polyurethane foam ingestion.  Clinical/medical toxicologists and emergency physicians need to be aware of the  highly expandable nature of this agent.},

  abstract = {Background: Goal-directed point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) protocols have been shown to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the initial clinical assessment of the critically ill patient. The diagnostic impact of the Abdominal and Cardiac Evaluation with Sonography in Shock (ACES) protocol was assessed in simulated emergency medical scenarios. Methods: Following a focused PoCUS training program, the diagnostic accuracy, confidence, and precision of 12 medical learners participating in standardized scenarios were tested using high-fidelity clinical and ultrasound simulators.Participants were assessed during 72 simulated cardiorespiratory scenarios. Differential diagnoses were collected from participants before and after PoCUS in each scenario, and confidence surveys were completed. Data were analysed using R software. Results: Prior to PoCUS, 45 (62.5\%) correct primary diagnoses were made compared with 64 (88.9\%) following PoCUS ({$\chi$}2 = 14, 1df, p = 0.0002).PoCUS was also shown to increase participants' confidence in their diagnoses. The mean confidence in diagnosis score pre-PoCUS was 52.2 (SD = 14.7), whereas post-PoCUS it was 81.7 (SD = 9.5). The estimated difference in means (-28.36) was significant (t = - 7.71, p {$<$} 0.0001). Using PoCUS, participants were further able to narrow their differential diagnoses. The median number of diagnoses for each patient pre-PoCUS was 3.5 (interquartile range [IQR] = 3.8, 3.0) with a median of 2.3 (IQR = 2.9,1.5) diagnoses post-PoCUS. The difference was significant (W = 0, p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that, in medical learners newly competent in PoCUS, the addition of an ACES PoCUS protocol to standard clinical assessment improves diagnostic accuracy, confidence, and precision in simulated cardiorespiratory scenarios. This is consistent with clinical studies and supports the use of ultrasound during medical simulation.},

It is unclear whether these are related to cognitive/mental experiences and awareness during CPR. Despite anecdotal reports the broad range of cognitive/mental experiences and awareness associated with CPR has not been systematically studied. Methods: The incidence and validity of awareness together with the range, characteristics and themes relating to memories/cognitive processes during CA was investigated through a 4 year multi-center observational study using a three stage quantitative and qualitative interview system. The feasibility of objectively testing the accuracy of claims of visual and auditory awareness was examined using specific tests. The outcome measures were (1) awareness/memories during CA and (2) objective verification of claims of awareness using specific tests. Results: Among 2060 CA events, 140 survivors completed stage 1 interviews, while 101 of 140 patients completed stage 2 interviews. 46\% had memories with 7 major cognitive themes: fear; animals/plants; bright light; violence/persecution; deja-vu; family; recalling events post-CA and 9\% had NDEs, while 2\% described awareness with explicit recall of 'seeing' and 'hearing' actual events related to their resuscitation. One had a verifiable period of conscious awareness during which time cerebral function was not expected. Conclusions: CA survivors commonly experience a broad range of cognitive themes, with 2\% exhibiting full awareness. This supports other recent studies that have indicated consciousness may be present despite clinically undetectable consciousness. This together with fearful experiences may contribute to PTSD and other cognitive deficits post CA.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient was referred to us with a  recent history of "ingestion of foreign body". The clinical presentation,  radiologic data, and treatment were reported. RESULTS: The patient had a pencil  placed sideways in the urinary bladder, with focal perforation of the left wall.  A cystoscopy was performed and the pencil was removed at the same time by using  grasping forceps and hydraulic overdistention of the urinary bladder.  CONCLUSIONS: Bladder is the most common location of foreign bodies of the  urogenital tract, almost always due to self-insertion into the urethra for the  purpose of masturbation or as a result of non-inhibited or altered behavior due  to psychiatric diseases, or to the influence of drugs. Most patients were too  ashamed to admit they had inserted or applied any object and usually presented  when a complication had occurred such as difficulty in voiding, hematuria, pain  or swelling, extravasations or abscess formation. The treatment can be  endoscopic, and it depends on the type of the foreign object and the operator's  skills.},

  abstract = {Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a vital system of human body, as it maintains plasma sodium concentration, arterial blood pressure and extracellular volume. Kidney-secreted renin enzyme acts on its substrate to form angiotensin II, a versatile effector peptide hormone. Every organ is affected by RAAS activation and the resultant hypertension, cell proliferation, inflammation, and fibrosis. The imbalance of renin and angiotensin II can result in an overwhelming number of chronic and acute diseases. RAAS is influenced by other enzymes, hormones, pumps and signaling pathways, hence, this review discusses important facets of this system, its crosstalk with other crucial factors like estrogen, thyroid, cortisol, kallikrein-kinin system, Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signaling, and sodium-potassium pump. The nexus of RAAS with the above-discussed systems was scantily explored before. So, this review furnishes a new perspective in comprehension of inflammation diseases. It is followed by the formulation of hypotheses, which can contribute to better management of an array of pathologies plaguing mankind. Manipulation of RAAS, by bending it towards ACE2 expression can regulate endocrine functions, which can be critical for a number of pathological management. Dietary intervention can restore RAAS to normalcy.},

This study aimed to examine the effect of music therapy on pain, anxiety, and the use of opioids among patients who underwent orthopedic surgery.~Methods include a comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Ovid, Clinical Key, and Google Scholar for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies published until December 2020 in the English language regarding music therapy in comparison to standard care on pain, anxiety, and opioid use among postoperative orthopedic patients.~Results of the study included 13 studies, having a total of 778 patients~included in a systematic review comprising ten RCTs and three quasi-experimental studies. Meta-analysis was performed on ten RCTs. The results showed a significant difference between the two groups regarding the use of music therapy in reducing the pain [standard mean difference (SMD) = -0.27; p = 0.002] and anxiety (SMD = -0.40; p = 0.0009). No statistically significant difference was found in the use of opioids and physiological variables between the two groups.~Conclusion of the current evidence demonstrated that music therapy significantly reduces pain and anxiety among postoperative orthopedic patients. Researchers recommended using it in the routine care of orthopedic patients for managing their subjective feelings like pain and anxiety. Musical intervention timing, duration, and type of music can be changed according to specific clinical settings and medical teams.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Foreign body (FB) ingestion is a common clinical problem. Patients with increased risk include children and geriatric patients, intellectually or mentally disabled people, patients with psychiatric disorders or prisoners. About 80-90\% of ingested blunt foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract without symptoms, impaction or mucosal injury. However, 10\% to 20\% of the ingested FBs, especially sharp-pointed objects, batteries or magnets, require endoscopic removal, and 1\% or less of the patients require further surgical interventions in case of complications. Endoscopic removal provides high efficacy with considerable low interventional risks using protective devices such as endoscopic overtubes to remove sharp-pointed objects. Laparoscopic or open surgery is the last resort when other techniques have failed. Case report: A 18 year old female with borderline personality disorder (BPD) was admitted to the emergency department having swallowed three razor blades, three pinboard tacks and several pieces of broken glass. After the orotracheal intubation for airway protection interventional gastroscopy was performed at the intensive care unit. To protect the esophagus from injury by sharp-pointed objects we used a specialized overtube (Guardus{\textregistered} Overtube, US Endoscopy, 25 cm). Endoscopically, all foreign bodies were removed. A CT scan confirmed that the gastrointestinal tract was empty of other FBs. After 12 hours of monitoring, the patient was extubated and transferred to the psychiatry department. Discussion and Conclusion: Intentional ingestion of foreign objects is a topic that has generated mounting interest among medical professionals over the past two decades. Foreign body ingestion has been reported in patients with personality disorders as part of a spectrum of self-harming behavior. Most FB ingestions involve sharp objects. Management of FB ingestion in patients with BPD requires high levels of interdisciplinary collaboration between gastroenterologists, psychiatrists and surgeons. Endoscopic removal is the first choice in the management algorithm of this clinical emergency due to its efficacy, low morbidity, and low cost compared to surgical treatment. The timing of intervention is influenced by the patient's age and clinical condition, the size, sharpness and type of the ingested object as well as anatomic location of the lodged object. Orotracheal intubation of the patients before endoscopy is recommended as well as the use of a specialized removal device.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Strictures of the esophagus in children may have multiple etiologies including congenital, inflammatory, infectious, caustic ingestion, and  gastroesophageal reflux (peptic stricture [PS]). Current literature lacks good  data documenting long-term outcomes in children. This makes it difficult to  counsel some patients about realistic treatment expectations. The objective of  this study is to evaluate our institutional experience and define the natural  history and treatment outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective review of clinical data  obtained from children who underwent dilation for PS was performed. RESULTS: Over  the past 30 years, 114 children and adolescents received 486 dilations. The most  common indications for stricture dilation were PS (42\%) and esophageal atresia  (38\%). Other lesser indications included congenital, foreign body, corrosive,  cancer, radiation, allergic, and infectious. This review focuses on the 48  children with PS. Of the children with PS, a congenital anomaly was identified in  23 children; and 12 had neurologic impairment. Average age at presentation was  10.2 years (range, 0.5-18.3 years). Most patients had had symptoms for many  months before diagnosis. Peptic stricture was most common in the lower esophagus  (n = 39). However, middle (n = 8) and upper (n = 1) strictures were occasionally  identified. Noncompliance with medical therapy was a challenge in 12\% (n = 5) of  children. Children with a PS received a median of 3 dilations, but a subset of 5  patients with severe strictures underwent up to 48 dilations (range, 1-48).  Repeated dilations were required for a median of 20 months (range, 1-242 months).  Among patients receiving esophageal dilation for PS, 94\% required an antireflux  procedure (19\% required a second antireflux surgery). A subgroup of patients (n =  10) was identified who required extended dilations, multiple surgeries, and  esophageal resection. This subgroup had a significantly longer period of  symptomatic disease and increased risk of esophageal resection compared with  those patients requiring fewer dilations. Surgical resection of the esophageal  stricture was ultimately required in 3 children with PS after failure of more  conservative measures. CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents presenting with  reflux esophageal stricture (PS) frequently require antireflux surgery, redo  antireflux surgery, and multiple dilations for recurrent symptoms. We hope that  these data will be of use to the clinician attempting to counsel patients and  parents about treatment expectations in this challenging patient population.},

We had reviewed 1,428 patients with esophageal foreign body, who were hospitalized and treated over the past 25~years. A classification summary was made of 121 patients (of these 1,428 cases) who presented with esophageal foreign body-induced perforation and complicated cervical abscess, mediastinitis, and mediastinal abscess. This summary considered foreign body types, location and lodging duration, complications, and surgical approaches. Among these 121 patients, esophageal foreign bodies in 81 patients were successfully extracted via esophagoscope or fiber optic esophagoscope. Cervical esophageal foreign bodies in 22 patients were extracted by esophagoscope and lateral cervical incision (n~=~6) and simple lateral cervical incision (n~=~16). Thoracotomy was performed to remove thoracic esophageal foreign bodies in 18 patients with 10 successes and 8 failures. Of the 121 patients, 67 patients with cervical abscess were cured by means of lateral cervical abscess incision and drainage, esophageal stent placement, and esophageal perforation repair with pedicle myolemma or pedicle muscular periosteum flap. 54 patients with mediastinitis and/or abscess were all cured, except one mortality, by means of mediastinotomy and drainage or/and closed-chest drainage, simple esophageal repair, esophageal repair with pedicle myolemma or pedicle muscular periosteum flap and stent placement for esophageal perforation, and esophageal exclusion plus two-stage gastric-pharyngeal anastomosis. In the treatment of esophageal foreign body-induced severe complications, various therapies should be applied simultaneously. Lateral cervical incision should be made immediately to remove the foreign bodies if the foreign body extraction under esophagoscope proves to be a failure after repeated attempts, or esophageal perforation develops during the procedure, or should cervical abscess develop. Mediastinotomy and drainage or/and closed-chest drainage should be carried out as early as possible when mediastinitis and/or mediastinal abscess develops after esophageal foreign body ingestion.},

The patient received flexible doses of esketamine nasal spray (56 or 84 mg) twice weekly for 4 weeks. On treatment day 1, the patient was administered 56 mg of esketamine nasal spray using two nasal spray devices (28 mg per device). Twenty minutes after the first esketamine nasal spray device was administered, the patient experienced a dissociative episode lasting 40 minutes that caused anxiety and confusion. The patient was encouraged to listen to music during treatment sessions, which resulted in notable improvement of her symptoms. Listening to music of choice immediately following esketamine nasal spray administration along with reassurance from staff may help manage confusion and anxiety associated with dissociation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current report is to evaluate the ability of videoendoscopic swallowing study in assessing pharyngeal propulsion and  aspiration episodes when compared with videofluoroscopy and manometry. STUDY  DESIGN: Prospective study. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with oropharyngeal  dysphagia underwent videoendoscopy of swallowing to assess pharyngeal propulsion  as pathologic or nonpathologic, and aspiration. These features were compared with  those found on manometry and videofluoroscopy, which were considered as the  reference examinations. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative  predictive values of videoendoscopy were estimated, with their 95\% confidence  intervals. RESULTS: A total agreement between videoendoscopy and videofluoroscopy  was found in 76.4\% of cases for pharyngeal propulsion and in 82.3\% for  aspiration. This rate for pharyngeal propulsion reached 82.3\% between  videoendoscopy and manometry. Moreover, in 24 cases (70.5\%) in which  videofluoroscopy and manometry agreed for pharyngeal propulsion, 22 were assessed  similarly through fiberoscopy. When using fluoroscopy and manometry as reference  examinations, videoendoscopy detected nearly 90\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] =  0.80, 1.0) of impaired pharyngeal propulsion. Concerning aspiration, 70\% (95\% CI  = 0.54, 0.85) of events detected by videoendoscopy were also observed on  videofluoroscopy. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive  values of videoendoscopy reached a higher rate (90\% to 92.8\%) when agreement was  found between fluoroscopy and manometry. CONCLUSIONS: Videoendoscopy is an  examination that can be used to detect inexpensively pharyngeal propulsion  disorders and aspiration episodes.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Previous research suggests there may be differences in the effects of adrenaline related to the initial cardiac arrest rhythm. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of adrenaline compared with placebo according to whether the initial cardiac arrest rhythm was shockable or non-shockable. Methods: Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival and neurological outcomes according to the initial arrest rhythm were compared amongst patients enrolled in the PARAMEDIC-2 randomised, placebo controlled trial. The results of the PARAMEDIC-2 and PACA out of hospital cardiac arrest trials were combined and meta-analysed. Results: The initial rhythm was known for 3929 (98.2\%) in the placebo arm and 3919 (97.6\%) in the adrenaline arm. The effect on the rate of ROSC of adrenaline relative to placebo was greater in patients with non-shockable cardiac rhythms (1002/3003 (33.4\%) versus 222/3005 (7.4\%), adjusted OR: 6.5, (95\% CI 5.6--7.6)) compared with shockable rhythms 349/716 (48.7\%) versus (208/702 (29.6\%), adjusted OR: 2.3, 95\%CI: 1.9--2.9)). The adjusted odds ratio for survival at discharge for non-shockable rhythms was 2.5 (1.3, 4.8) and 1.3 (0.9, 1.8) for shockable rhythms (P value for interaction 0.065) and 1.8 (0.8--4.1) and 1.1 (0.8--1.6) respectively for neurological outcome at discharge (P value for interaction 0.295). Meta-analysis found similar results. Conclusion: Relative to placebo, the effects of adrenaline ROSC are greater for patients with an initially non-shockable rhythm than those with a shockable rhythms. Similar patterns are observed for longer term survival outcomes and favourable neurological outcomes, although the differences in effects are less pronounced. ISRCTN73485024.},

Methods:{\enspace} The PARAMEDIC2 trial was undertaken across 5 NHS ambulance services in England and Wales with randomisation between December 2014 and October 2017. Patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were unresponsive to initial resuscitation attempts were randomly assigned to 1 mg intravenous adrenaline or matching placebo according to treatment packs that were identical apart from treatment number. Participants and study staff were masked to treatment allocation. Results:{\enspace} 8016 patients were enrolled, 4902 sustained a witnessed cardiac arrest of whom 2437 received placebo and 2465 received adrenaline. The odds of return of spontaneous circulation decreased in both groups over time but at a greater rate in the placebo arm odds ratio (OR) 0.93 (95\% CI 0.92--0.95) compared with the adrenaline arm OR 0.96 (95\% CI 0.95--0.97); interaction OR: 1.03, 95\% CI 1.01--1.05, p\,=\,0.005. By contrast, although the rate of survival and favourable neurological outcome decreased as time to treatment increased, the rates did not differ between the adrenaline and placebo groups. Conclusion:{\enspace} The rate of return of spontaneous circulation, survival and favourable neurological outcomes decrease over time. As time to drug treatment increases, adrenaline increases the chances of return of spontaneous circulation. Longer term outcomes were not affected by the time to adrenaline administration.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Concern about the use of epinephrine as a treatment for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest led the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation to call for a placebocontrolled trial to determine whether the use of epinephrine is safe and effective in such patients. METHODS In a randomized, double-blind trial involving 8014 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United Kingdom, paramedics at five National Health Service ambulance services administered either parenteral epinephrine (4015 patients) or saline placebo (3999 patients), along with standard care. The primary outcome was the rate of survival at 30 days. Secondary outcomes included the rate of survival until hospital discharge with a favorable neurologic outcome, as indicated by a score of 3 or less on the modified Rankin scale (which ranges from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]). RESULTS At 30 days, 130 patients (3.2\%) in the epinephrine group and 94 (2.4\%) in the placebo group were alive (unadjusted odds ratio for survival, 1.39; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.06 to 1.82; P\,=\,0.02). There was no evidence of a significant difference in the proportion of patients who survived until hospital discharge with a favorable neurologic outcome (87 of 4007 patients [2.2\%] vs. 74 of 3994 patients [1.9\%]; unadjusted odds ratio, 1.18; 95\% CI, 0.86 to 1.61). At the time of hospital discharge, severe neurologic impairment (a score of 4 or 5 on the modified Rankin scale) had occurred in more of the survivors in the epinephrine group than in the placebo group (39 of 126 patients [31.0\%] vs. 16 of 90 patients [17.8\%]).

CONCLUSIONS In adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the use of epinephrine resulted in a significantly higher rate of 30-day survival than the use of placebo, but there was no significant between-group difference in the rate of a favorable neurologic outcome because more survivors had severe neurologic impairment in the epinephrine group.

Objectives: To conduct a phase II trial evaluating the hypothesis that early low-dose norepinephrine in adults with sepsis with hypotension increases shock control by 6 hours compared with standard care. Methods: This single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. The study enrolled 310 adults diagnosed with sepsis with hypotension. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: early norepinephrine (n = 155) and standard treatment (n = 155). The primary outcome was shock control rate (defined as achievement of mean arterial blood pressure {$>$}65 mm Hg, with urine flow {$>$}0.5 ml/kg/h for 2 consecutive hours, or decreased serum lactate {$>$}10\% from baseline) by 6 hours after diagnosis. Measurements and Main Results: The patients in both groups were well matched in background characteristics and disease severity. Median time from emergency room arrival to norepinephrine administration was significantly shorter in the early norepinephrine group (93 vs. 192 min; P, 0.001). Shock control rate by 6 hours was significantly higher in the early norepinephrine group (118/155 [76.1\%] vs. 75/155 [48.4\%]; P, 0.001). The 28-day mortality was not different between groups: 24/155 (15.5\%) in the early norepinephrine group versus 34/155 (21.9\%) in the standard treatment group (P = 0.15). The early norepinephrine group was associated with lower incidences of cardiogenic pulmonary edema (22/155 [14.4\%] vs. 43/155 [27.7\%]; P = 0.004) and new-onset arrhythmia (17/155 [11\%] vs. 31/155 [20\%]; P = 0.03).},

Methods: Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to grade the quality of evidence and to determine the strengths of the recommendations. As efficacy and harm may vary in different subpopulations of patients with acute circulatory failure, we produced recommendations for general intensive care unit (ICU) patients and those with sepsis, trauma and burn injury. Results: For general ICU patients and those with sepsis, we recommend using crystalloids for resuscitation rather than hydroxyethyl starch and we suggest using crystalloids rather than gelatin and albumin. For patients with trauma we recommend to use crystalloids for resuscitation rather than colloid solutions. For patients with burn injury we provide no recommendations as there are very limited data from randomised trials on fluid resuscitation in this patient population. Conclusions: We recommend using crystalloid solutions rather than colloid solutions for resuscitation in the majority of critically ill patients with acute circulatory failure.},

  abstract = {ObjectiveS:: Norepinephrine exerts venoconstriction that could increase both the mean systemic pressure and the resistance to venous return, but this has not yet been investigated in human septic shock. We examined the relative importance of both effects and the resulting effect on venous return when decreasing the dose of norepinephrine. SETTING:: Intensive care unit. PATIENTS:: Sixteen septic shock patients. MEASUREMENTS:: For estimating the venous return curve, we constructed the regression line between the pairs of cardiac index (pulse contour analysis) and central venous pressure values. These values were measured during 15-sec end-inspiratory and end-expiratory ventilatory occlusions performed at two levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, in view of widening the range of cardiac index:central venous pressure measurements and increasing the accuracy of the regression line. The x-axis intercept of the regression line was used to estimate the mean systemic pressure and the inverse of the slope of the regression line to quantify resistance to venous return. These measurements were obtained before and after decreasing the dose of norepinephrine. Passive leg raising was performed before and after decreasing the dose of norepinephrine. MAIN Results:: Decreasing the dose of norepinephrine from 0.30 (0.10-1.40) to 0.19 (0.08-1.15) {$\mu$}g/kg/min decreased the mean systemic pressure from 33 {\textpm} 12 mm Hg to 26 {\textpm} 10 mm Hg (p = .0003). The slope of the multipoint cardiac index:central venous pressure relationship increased (p = .02). The resistance to venous return decreased, i.e., 1/slope decreased. Simultaneously, cardiac index decreased from 3.47 {\textpm} 0.86 L/min/m2 to 3.28 {\textpm} 0.76 L/min/m (p = .04), indicating a decrease in venous return. Passive leg raising increased cardiac index to a larger extent after (8\% {\textpm} 4\%) than before (1\% {\textpm} 4\%) decreasing norepinephrine (p = .001), suggesting an increase in unstressed blood volume at the lowest dose of norepinephrine. Conclusions:: In septic shock patients, decreasing the dose of norepinephrine decreased the mean systemic pressure and, to a lesser extent, the resistance to venous return. As a result, venous return decreased. {\copyright} 2012 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Injury remains a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in the developing world. The probability of injury occurrence is influenced by  agent, host and environmental factors. Studies of repeat injuries in childhood  therefore provide insight into factors in the epidemiological triad predisposing  children to injury. OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportion of children and the  factors associated with repeat presentations to the Red Cross War Memorial  Children's Hospital Trauma Unit (RCWMCH TU) in Cape Town, South Africa, for all  non-transport-related injuries in childhood. METHODS: This was a retrospective  cohort study using data from the RCWMCH TU. We included children aged 0 - 10  years with first presentation from January 1997 to June 2013 and followed up  until the earlier of age 13 years or June 2016. We assessed individual and  population-level factors associated with repeat injury using multilevel Poisson  regression analysis. Child dependency ratios were derived from the 2011 National  Census. RESULTS: Between 1997 and 2013, 72 490 children aged \&lt;10 years (59\%  male) presented to the RCWMCH TU for the first time with injuries. After the  initial injury, 9 417 (13\%) presented with a repeat injury by 2016 and before age  13 years. After adjusting for health subdistrict, distance from RCWMCH TU and age  at first presentation, factors associated with reduced repeat presentation were  injury identified as due to abuse (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 0.6; 95\%  confidence interval (CI) 0.4 - 0.7), fluid burn (aIRR 0.6; 95\% CI 0.6 - 0.7),  foreign body ingestion (aIRR 0.7; 95\% CI 0.7 - 0.9), and moderate and severe (v.  minor) initial injury (aIRR 0.9; 95\% CI 0.8 - 0.9 and aIRR 0.7; 95\% CI 0.6 - 0.8,  respectively), while boys were more likely to have repeat injury presentations  (aIRR 1.4; 95\% CI 1.4 - 1.5). CONCLUSIONS: Repeat presentations were substantial  and associated with male gender. They occurred less commonly after fluid burn  injuries, foreign body ingestion and moderate to severe injuries. Children with  intentional injuries were also less likely to have a repeat presentation. Further  research is indicated for childhood injuries with greater propensity to repeat,  including non-height falls and sport-related injuries. Secondary injury  prevention education should not neglect patients with unintentional and minor  injuries. These results strengthen the hypothesis that injuries arise as a result  of sustained exposure to agent, host and environmental risk factors.},

We set out to determine CSI incidence, imaging rates and the frequency of previously identified CSI risk factors, and thus assess the projected impact on imaging rates if CDRs were strictly applied as a rule in our population. Methods{\enspace} A single-\-centre prospective observational study on all aged under 16 years presenting for assessment of possible CSI to a tertiary paediatric emergency department over a year, commencing September 2015. CDR variables from the National Emergency X-\-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) rule, Canadian C-\-Spine rule (CCR) and proposed Paediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) rule were collected prospectively and applied post hoc. Results{\enspace} 1010 children were enrolled; 973 had not received prior imaging. Of these, 40.7\% received cervical spine imaging; 32.4\% X-\-rays, 13.4\% CT scan and 3\% MRI. All three CDRs identified the five children (0.5\%) with CSI who had not received prior imaging. If CDRs were strictly applied as a rule for imaging, projected imaging rates in our setting would be as follows: NEXUS-44\% (95\% CI 41\% to 47.4\%), CCR-\-at least 48.4\% (95\% CI 45.3\% to 51.7\%) and PECARN-68\% (95\% CI 65.1\% to 71.1\%). Conclusion{\enspace} CSIs were rare (0.5\% of our cohort), however, 40\% of children received imaging. CDRs have been designed to guide imaging decisions; if strictly applied as a rule for imaging, the CDRs assessed in this study would increase imaging rates. Projected rates differ considerably depending on the CDR applied. These findings highlight the need for a validated paediatric-\- specific cervical spine imaging CDR.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Pulse contour cardiac output (PCCO) analysis is a technique for continuous cardiac output (CO) monitoring through an arterial catheter after calibration by transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD). Studies in adults show good correlation with pulmonary artery thermodilution (PATD) CO. Data are limited in children and patients with hemodynamic instability. The objective was to determine whether TPTD CO and PCCO analysis correlate with PATD CO in a piglet model of severe hemorrhagic shock. Mixed venous oxygen saturation (S{\=V}o2) was also compared with PATD CO. DESIGN: Prospective animal study. SETTING: University animal research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Domesticated piglets, 24-37 kg. INTERVENTIONS: Hemorrhagic shock was created by graded hemorrhage in anesthetized piglets. Hemorrhage was initiated to achieve mean arterial pressure plateaus of 60, 50, 40, 30, and 20 mm Hg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: CO was measured by PATD and simultaneously with two femoral artery PCCO catheters. At each mean arterial pressure plateau, one PCCO catheter was recalibrated by TPTD; the other catheter was not recalibrated during hemorrhage. TPTD CO, PCCO measurements from each catheter, and S{\=V}o2 were compared with PATD CO at each mean arterial pressure level. TPTD CO and recalibrated PCCO showed excellent correlation (r = .96 and .97) and small bias (+0.11 and +0.14 L/min), respectively, compared with PATD. Without recalibration, PCCO measurements were not accurate during rapid hemorrhage (r = .22). S{\=V}o2 decline did not correlate as well with PATD CO (r = .69). CONCLUSIONS: TPTD CO and recalibrated PCCO analysis correlate well with PATD CO in this severe hemorrhagic shock model. The mean difference is small ({$<$}0.15 L/min) and is not clinically significant. With rapid changes in blood pressure or intravascular volume, PCCO is not accurate unless recalibrated by TPTD CO. S{\=V}o2 did not correlate well with CO in this model. {\copyright} 2008 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Response to fluid challenge is often defined as an increase in cardiac index (CI) of more than 10-15\%. However, in clinical practice CI values are often not available. We evaluated whether changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) correlate with changes in CI after fluid challenge in patients with septic shock. Methods: This was an observational study in which we reviewed prospectively collected data from 51 septic shock patients in whom complete hemodynamic measurements had been obtained before and after a fluid challenge with 1,000 ml crystalloid (Hartman's solution) or 500 ml colloid (hydroxyethyl starch 6\%). CI was measured using thermodilution. Patients were divided into two groups (responders and non-responders) according to their change in CI (responders: \%CI{$>$}10\%) after the fluid challenge. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-way analysis of variance test followed by a Student's t test with adjustment for multiple comparisons. Pearson's correlation and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were also used. Results: Mean patient age was 67 {\textpm} 17 years and mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) upon admittance to the intensive care unit was 10 {\textpm} 3. In the 25 responders, MAP increased from 69 {\textpm} 9 to 77 {\textpm} 9 mmHg, pulse pressure (PP) increased from 59 {\textpm} 15 to 67 {\textpm} 16, and CI increased from 2.8 {\textpm} 0.8 to 3.4 {\textpm} 0.9 L/min/m 2 (all p{$<$}0.001). There were no significant correlations between the changes in MAP, PP, and CI. Conclusions: Changes in MAP do not reliably track changes in CI after fluid challenge in patients with septic shock and, consequently, should be interpreted carefully when evaluating the response to fluid challenge in such patients. {\copyright} Copyright jointly held by Springer and ESICM 2012.},

RESULTS: The most common location was the terminal ileum (n = 11), followed by the rectosigmoid junction (n = 5). The objects were mainly bone fragments and toothpicks. The diagnosis was generally made at operation, and only 4 of the 21 patients had signs of pneumoperitoneum on the preoperative abdominal film. The most common treatment was simple suture of the defect. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal perforation by a foreign body is uncommon, and normally affects the ileocaecal and rectosigmoid regions, in which it is unusual to find pneumoperitoneum preoperatively. It must be considered in the differential diagnosis of such conditions as acute appendicitis and diverticulitis.},

Body packers either swallow drug-filled packets or introduce drug-filled packets into their bodies rectally or vaginally with the purpose of concealing them. The three main smuggled drugs are cocaine, heroin and cannabis products. Body packing represents a serious risk of acute narcotic toxicity from drug exposure, intestinal obstruction owing to pellet impaction and bowel perforation with consequent abdominal sepsis. A suspected body packer is generally admitted to hospital to perform imaging investigations and confirm the presence of drugs in his/her body. Radiological imaging methods are essential to diagnose body packing and to detect potential complications. Increasing sophistication of traffickers and improvements in packaging add to the detection difficulty.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lung ultrasonography (LUS) has emerged as a noninvasive tool for the differential diagnosis of pulmonary diseases. However, its use for the diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) still raises some concerns. We tested the hypothesis that an integrated approach implementing LUS with clinical assessment would have higher diagnostic accuracy than a standard workup in differentiating ADHF from noncardiogenic dyspnea in the ED. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, prospective cohort study in seven Italian EDs. For patients presenting with acute dyspnea, the emergency physician was asked to categorize the diagnosis as ADHF or noncardiogenic dyspnea after (1) the initial clinical assessment and (2) after performing LUS (``LUS-implemented'' diagnosis). All patients also underwent chest radiography. After discharge, the cause of each patient's dyspnea was determined by independent review of the entire medical record. The diagnostic accuracy of the different approaches was then compared. RESULTS: The study enrolled 1,005 patients. The LUS-implemented approach had a significantly higher accuracy (sensitivity, 97\% [95\% CI, 95\%-98.3\%]; specificity, 97.4\% [95\% CI, 95.7\%-98.6\%]) in differentiating ADHF from noncardiac causes of acute dyspnea than the initial clinical workup (sensitivity, 85.3\% [95\% CI, 81.8\%-88.4\%]; specificity, 90\% [95\% CI, 87.2\%-92.4\%]), chest radiography alone (sensitivity, 69.5\% [95\% CI, 65.1\%-73.7\%]; specificity, 82.1\% [95\% CI, 78.6\%-85.2\%]), and natriuretic peptides (sensitivity, 85\% [95\% CI, 80.3\%-89\%]; specificity, 61.7\% [95\% CI, 54.6\%-68.3\%]; n 5 486). Net reclassification index of the LUS-implemented approach compared with standard workup was 19.1\%. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of LUS with the clinical evaluation may improve accuracy of ADHF diagnosis in patients presenting to the ED.

For each score system, the hypothesis that there is no difference in the score between the cardiac and the non-cardiac group was rejected (all p-values below 0.0001). Strong correlation between the three score systems was shown (Spearman correlation coefficient: r = 0.71 p {$<$} 0.0001 for EGSYS-U and OESIL, r = 0.88 p {$<$} 0.0001 for EGSYS-U and EGSYS-M, r = 0.60 p {$<$} 0.0001 for EGSYS-M and OESIL).

  abstract = {Background: The study aimed to characterize trends in incidence, etiology, fracture types, surgical procedures, complications, and concurrent injuries associated with traumatic pediatric cervical fracture using a nationwide database. Methods: The Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) was queried. Trauma cases from 2003 to 2012 were identified, and cervical fracture patients were isolated. Demographics, etiologies, fracture levels, procedures, complications, and concurrent injuries were assessed. The t-tests elucidated significance for continuous variables, and v2 for categoric values. Logistic regressions identified predictors of spinal cord injury (SCI), surgery, any complication, and mortality. Level of significance was P, .05. Results: A total of 11 196 fracture patients were isolated (age, 16.63 years; male, 65.7\%; white, 65.4\%; adolescent, 55.4\%). Incidence significantly increased since 2003 (2003 vs 2012, 2.39\% vs 3.12\%, respectively), as did Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI; 2003 vs 2012, 0.2012 vs 0.4408, respectively). Most common etiology was motor vehicle accidents (50.5\%). Infants and children frequently fractured at C2 (closed: 43.1\%, 32.9\%); adolescents and young adults frequently fractured at C7 (closed: 23.9\%, 26.5\%). Upper cervical SCI was less common (5.8\%) than lower cervical SCI (10.9\%). Lower cervical unspecified-SCI, anterior cord syndrome, and other specified SCIs significantly decreased since 2003. Complications were common (acute respiratory distress syndrome, 7.8\%; anemia, 6.7\%; shock, 3.0\%; and mortality, 4.2\%), with bowel complications, cauda equina, anemia, and shock rates significantly increasing since 2003. Concurrent injuries were common (15.2\% ribs; 14.4\% skull; 7.1\% pelvis) and have significantly increased since 2003. Predictors of SCI included sports injury and CCI. Predictors of surgery included falls, sports injuries, CCI, length of stay, and SCI. CCI, SCIs, and concurrent injuries were predictors of any complication and mortality, all (P, .001). Conclusions: Since 2003, incidence, complications, concurrent injuries, and fusions have increased. CCI, SCI, falls, and sports injuries were significant predictors of surgical intervention. Decreased mortality and SCI rates may indicate improving emergency medical services and management guidelines. Level of Evidence: III Clinical Relevance: Clinicians should be aware of increased case complexity in the onset of added perioperative complications and concurrent injuries. Cervical fractures resultant of sports injuries should be scrutinized for concurrent SCIs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction because of a dysregulated host response to infection. Disturbed microvascular blood flow is associated with excess mortality and is a potential future target for interventions. This review addresses the evidence for pharmacological manipulation of the microcirculation in sepsis assessed by techniques that evaluate the sublingual microvasculature. METHODS: Systematic review using a published protocol. Eligibility criteria were studies of septic patients published from January 2000 to February 2018. Interventions were drugs aimed at improving perfusion. Outcome was improvement in microvascular flow using orthogonal polarization spectral, sidestream dark field, or incident dark field imaging (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria used). RESULTS: Two thousand six hundred and six articles were screened and 22 included. (6 randomized controlled trials, 12 interventional, 3 observational, and 1 pilot, n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}572 participants). Multiple measurement techniques were described, including: automated analyses, subjective, and composite scoring systems. Norepinephrine was not found to improve microvascular flow (low-grade evidence, n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}6 studies); except in chronic hypertension (low, n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1 study). Addition of arginine vasopressin or terlipressin to norepinephrine maintained flow while decreasing norepinephrine requirements (high, n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}2 studies). Neither dobutamine nor glyceryl trinitrate consistently improved flow (low, n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}6 studies). A single study (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}40 participants) demonstrated improved flow with levosimendan (high). In a risk of bias assessment 16/16 interventional, pilot and observational studies were found to be high risk. CONCLUSIONS: There is no robust evidence to date that any one agent can reproducibly lead to improved microvascular flow. Furthermore, no study demonstrated outcome benefit of one therapeutic agent over another. Updated consensus guidelines could improve comparable reporting of measurements and reduce bias, to enable meaningful comparisons around the effects of individual pharmacological agents.},

Prior studies have examined  the effectiveness of this procedure, however no prior study has thoroughly  evaluated its complications. We anticipate that this analysis will provide  valuable insight into these procedures which can be used in patient education and  post-operative follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Manufacturer and User  Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for cases reporting  injury related to the pillar procedure. The case narratives were individually  analyzed and categorized by type of complication. A comparison of extruding parts  and select complications was also performed using chi-square analysis. RESULTS:  Of the 261 cases reported, 73.6\% reporting extruding parts, 47.5\% described  patient pain, and 38.7\% included patients describing a foreign body sensation.  Infection was reported in 7.7\% of the cases with cellulitis and abscess formation  specifically mentioned in one case. Cases describing pain and difficulty  swallowing were significantly more likely to have reported extruding parts  (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study describes various complications associated  with this procedure. The description of these complications and accompanying  literature review may provide healthcare professionals and patients with an  understanding of the scope of adverse events related to this procedure.},

  abstract = {Objective Deliberate foreign body ingestion (DFBI) is often impulsively driven, repetitive and refractory to intervention and frequently necessitates multiple medical interventions. As such, the frustrations among health care providers are great, and the financial toll on health care is significant. Nevertheless, the literature on DFBI is sparse, and suggestions for treatment planning and management are limited. The authors sought to investigate and uncover efficacious treatments and strategies for preventing reoccurrence in DFBI. We build on earlier work by offering both broad and diagnosis-specific management strategies. Method A literature review was performed addressing the presentation, management and prevention of reoccurrences of DFBI. Four cases of DFBI are presented illustrating those psychiatric diagnoses (psychosis, malingering, obsessive--compulsive disorder and borderline personality disorder) most frequently encountered in hospital practice. Both broad and specific treatment approaches are presented. Results Patients engaging in DFBI are best managed through a multidisciplinary approach, following acute medical management. Successful strategies for the prevention of reoccurrences of DFBI are inconclusive. Conclusion Understanding the function of this behavior is critical in developing treatment for patients who engage in these dangerous, potentially life-threatening, self-injurious behaviors. An amalgam of medical, pharmacological and cognitive--behavioral interventions is recommended, as is additional research.},

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) consists of varied pathophysiological consequences and alteration of intracranial dynamics, reduction of the cerebral blood flow and oxygenation. In the past decade more emphasis has been directed towards optimizing cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in patients who have suffered TBI. Injured brain may show signs of ischemia if CPP remains below 50 mmHg and raising the CPP above 60 mmHg may avoid cerebral oxygen desaturation. Though CPP above 70 mmHg is influential in achieving an improved patient outcome, maintenance of CPP higher than 70 mmHg was associated with greater risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The target CPP has been laid within 50-70 mmHg. Cerebral blood flow and metabolism are heterogeneous after TBI and with regional temporal differences in the requirement for CPP. Brain monitoring techniques such as jugular venous oximetry, monitoring of brain tissue oxygen tension (PbrO2 ), and cerebral microdialysis provide complementary and specific information that permits the selection of the optimal CPP. This review highlights the rationale for use CPP directed therapies and neuromonitoring to identify optimal CPP of head injured patients. The article also reviews the evidence provided by various clinical trials regarding optimal CPP and their application in the management of head injured patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The prevalence of pulmonary embolism among patients hospitalized for syncope is not well documented, and current guidelines pay little attention to a diagnostic workup for pulmonary embolism in these patients. METHODS We performed a systematic workup for pulmonary embolism in patients admitted to 11 hospitals in Italy for a first episode of syncope, regardless of whether there were alternative explanations for the syncope. The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was ruled out in patients who had a low pretest clinical probability, which was defined according to the Wells score, in combination with a negative d-dimer assay. In all other patients, computed tomographic pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion lung scanning was performed. RESULTS A total of 560 patients (mean age, 76 years) were included in the study. A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was ruled out in 330 of the 560 patients (58.9\%) on the basis of the combination of a low pretest clinical probability of pulmonary embolism and negative d-dimer assay. Among the remaining 230 patients, pulmonary embolism was identified in 97 (42.2\%). In the entire cohort, the prevalence of pulmonary embolism was 17.3\% (95\% confidence interval, 14.2 to 20.5). Evidence of an embolus in a main pulmonary or lobar artery or evidence of perfusion defects larger than 25\% of the total area of both lungs was found in 61 patients. Pulmonary embolism was identified in 45 of the 355 patients (12.7\%) who had an alternative explanation for syncope and in 52 of the 205 patients (25.4\%) who did not. CONCLUSIONS Pulmonary embolism was identified in nearly one of every six patients hospitalized for a first episode of syncope.},

Secondary endpoints were the changes in microvascular flow index (MFI), "clinical signs of impaired organ perfusion", and stroke volume (SV) after fluid administration, and the differences between groups. Methods: Prospective, single-center, observational study in a 22-bed mixed intensive care unit (ICU). Patients {$\geq$}18 years with invasive hemodynamic monitoring and "clinical signs of impaired organ perfusion" as the principal reason for fluid administration were included. Before and after fluid challenge, systemic hemodynamics and direct in vivo observation of the sublingual microcirculation with sidestream dark-field imaging were obtained. Microvascular flow index (MFI) {$<$}2.6 was predefined as abnormal. Results: N = 50. At baseline, MFI {$<$}2.6 was present in 66 \% of the patients. In these patients, MFI increased from 2.3 (2-2.5) at baseline to 2.5 (2.1-2.8) after fluid challenge (p = 0.003). This was accompanied by a reduction in the number of "clinical signs of impaired organ perfusion" from 2 (1-2) to 1 (0-2) (p {$<$} 0.001). However, in patients with MFI {$>$}2.6 at baseline, MFI and clinical signs changed insignificantly [2.8 (2.8-2.9) versus 2.8 (2.7-3), p = 0.45, respectively, 1 (1-2) versus 1 (1-2), p {$<$} 0.32]. These changes were not restricted to patients with a rise in SV {$\geq$}10 \%. Conclusions: These data add to the understanding that noninvasive assessment of microvascular blood flow may help to identify patients eligible for fluid therapy, and to evaluate its effect. {\copyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Study objective: Older adults with syncope are commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). We seek to derive a novel risk-stratification tool to predict 30-day serious cardiac outcomes. Methods: We performed a prospective, observational study of older adults ({$\geq$}60 years) with unexplained syncope or near syncope who presented to 11 EDs in the United States. Patients with a serious diagnosis identified in the ED were excluded. We collected clinical and laboratory data on all patients. Our primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality or serious cardiac outcome. Results: We enrolled 3,177 older adults with unexplained syncope or near syncope between April 2013 and September 2016. Mean age was 73 years (SD 9.0 years). The incidence of the primary outcome was 5.7\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 4.9\% to 6.5\%). Using Bayesian logistic regression, we derived the FAINT score: history of heart failure, history of cardiac arrhythmia, initial abnormal ECG result, elevated pro B-type natriuretic peptide, and elevated high-sensitivity troponin T. A FAINT score of 0 versus greater than or equal to 1 had sensitivity of 96.7\% (95\% CI 92.9\% to 98.8\%) and specificity 22.2\% (95\% CI 20.7\% to 23.8\%), respectively. The FAINT score tended to be more accurate than unstructured physician judgment: area under the curve 0.704 (95\% CI 0.669 to 0.739) versus 0.630 (95\% CI 0.589 to 0.670). Conclusion: Among older adults with syncope or near syncope of potential cardiac cause, a FAINT score of zero had a reasonably high sensitivity for excluding death and serious cardiac outcomes at 30 days. If externally validated, this tool could improve resource use for this common condition.},

Patients who  notoriously swallow foreign objects generate significant economic costs to  hospitals. In previous publications, it has been argued that hospitals might  reduce the need for endoscopy by offering such patients a paid position to  discourage foreign body ingestions. However, the game-theoretical analysis  offered in the literature was based on a static game which did not justify the  relevant equilibrium. To obtain the actual goal of keeping the patient away from  foreign body ingestion, we consider a repeated game with an infinite horizon. We  show that there exists a combination of strategies applied by the hospital and  the patient that leads to a steady state in which the patient will be discouraged  from foreign body ingestion.},

METHODS: After internal review board approval, the charts of pediatric  patients (0-18years old) who had undergone slide tracheoplasty for  tracheoesophageal fistula were retrospectively reviewed. Patient information and  surgical outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: Nine patients underwent slide  tracheoplasty for correction of TE fistula. In five patients the original TE  fistula was congenital. Other causes included battery ingestion, tracheostomy  tube complications, foreign body erosion, and an iatrogenic injury. The average  age at repair was 48{\textpm}64 months (range: 1-190). Seven patients had undergone  previous TEF repair either open or endoscopically. There were no recurrences  after repair. Two patients had sternal periosteum interposed between the  esophagus and trachea. There were no TEF recurrences. A single patient had  dehiscence of the tracheal anastomosis and underwent a second procedure.  CONCLUSION: Slide tracheoplasty is an effective method to treat complex TE  fistulas. The procedure was not associated with any recurrences. This is the  first description of a novel, effective, and safe method to treat TE fistulas.},

It will suggest that once the possibilities of dissent through the voice (the political tool par excellence in a liberal democracy, and one associated primarily with rationality and the capacity for reason) are foreclosed, migrants tend to resort to another powerful tool: their own body. Detainees have made their bodies speak by resorting to practices of self-mutilation, hunger strike, suicide attempts, and lips and eyes sewing. Detainees' violent acts of dissent are not dissimilar from the violent modalities used, a few centuries earlier, by some enslaved people who chose liberty through death. The aim is not so much to make comparison between the two figures, but to emphasise the way in which, under conditions of extreme control, subjugation or unfreedom, acts of dissent and resistance -- and thus acts of politics, as articulated in Ranci{\`e}re's concept of dissensus -- are not necessarily enacted through democratic practices but, on the contrary, through whatever modalities are available to them, including violent (self-harm) modalities.},

  abstract = {Background: Syncope is one of the most common reasons for emergency department and urgent care clinic visits. The management of syncope continues to be a challenging problem for front-line providers inasmuch as there are a multitude of possible causes for syncope ranging from relatively benign conditions to potentially life-threatening ones. In any event, it is important to identify those syncope patients who are at immediate risk of life-threatening events; these individuals require prompt hospitalization and thorough evaluation. Conversely, it is equally important to avoid unnecessary hospitalization of low-risk patients since unneeded hospital care adds to the healthcare cost burden. Results: Historically, front-line providers have taken a conservative approach with admission rates as high as 30-50\% among syncope patients. A number of studies evaluating both the short- and long-term risk of adverse events in patients with syncope have focused on development of risk-stratification guidelines to assist providers in making a confident and well-informed choice between hospitalization and out-patient referral. In this regard, a much needed consensus on optimal decision-making process has not been developed to date. However, knowledge from various available risk-stratification studies can be helpful. Conclusion: This review summarizes the findings of various risk-stratification studies and points out key differences between them. While, the existing risk-stratification methods cannot replace critical assessment by an experienced physician, they do provide valuable guidance. In addition, the various risk-assessment schemes highlight the need for careful initial clinical assessment of syncope patients, selective testing, and being mindful of the short- and long-term risks. {\copyright} 2014 Japanese College of Cardiology.},

Stable patients with lower grade injuries are treated conservatively; those stable patients with moderate to severe splenic injuries (grade III-V) benefit from endovascular splenic artery embolization. Two widely used embolization approaches are proximal and distal splenic artery embolization. Proximal splenic artery embolization decreases the perfusion pressure in the spleen but allows for viability of the spleen to be maintained via collateral pathways. Distal embolization can be used in cases of focal injury. In this article we review relevant literature on splenic embolization indication, and technique, comparing and contrasting proximal and distal embolization. Additionally, we review relevant anatomy and discuss collateral perfusion pathways following proximal embolization. Finally, we review potential complications of splenic artery embolization.},

All patients were followed up to determine whether they had experienced a serious outcome within 7 days of their ED visit. Univariate analysis was performed with r2 and nonparametric techniques on all predictor variables. g Analysis was performed on variables requiring interpretation. Variables with g more than 0.5 and a P value less than .1 were analyzed with recursive partitioning techniques to develop a rule that would maximize the determination of serious outcomes. Results: There were 684 visits for syncope, and 79 of these visits resulted in patients' experiencing serious outcomes.

  abstract = {Due to the potential risk of volume overload, physicians are hesitant to aggressively fluid-resuscitate septic patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). Primary objective: To calculate the percentage of ESRD patients on HD (Case) who received {$\geq$}30 mL/Kg fluid resuscitation within the first 6 h compared to non-ESRD patients (Control) that presented with severe sepsis (SeS) or septic shock (SS). Secondary objectives: Effect of fluid resuscitation on intubation rate, need for urgent dialysis, hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission and LOS, need for vasopressors, and hospital mortality. Medical records of 715 patients with sepsis, SeS, SS, and ESRD were reviewed. We identified 104 Case and 111 Control patients. In the Case group, 23\% of patients received {$\geq$}30 mL/Kg fluids compared to 60\% in the Control group (p {$<$} 0.001). There was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality, need for urgent dialysis, intubation rates, ICU LOS, or hospital LOS between the two groups. Subgroup analysis between ESRD patients who received {$\geq$}30 mL/Kg (N = 80) vs those who received {$<$}30 mL/Kg (N = 24) showed no significant difference in any of the secondary outcomes. Compliance with 30 mL/Kg fluids was low for all patients but significantly lower for ESRD patients. Aggressive fluid resuscitation appears to be safe in ESRD patients.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Foreign body (FB) ingestion in children has varied presentation. When unwitnessed, it poses therapeutic and diagnostic challenges especially in the  presence of pre-existing anatomical pathology. We aim to analyze the clinical  course, management, and outcome of children with impacted esophageal FBs.  METHODS: Retrospective chart review (Jan 2000-Feb 2018) recruiting children with  impacted esophageal FBs. FBs in cricopharynx and those that moved to stomach were  excluded. Investigations/management were based on underlying anatomical  pathology, duration of impaction, and difficult FBs. Clinical details,  management, and outcomes were collated. RESULTS: Of 86 children, N1\,=\,31 had  identifiable predisposing anatomic pathology and N2\,=\,55 had impactions in normal  esophagus or difficult FBs. N1 group presented early (42~months), had recurrent  impactions (1-6), and needed multiple dilatations (0-8) and longer follow-up (avg  35~months). Food matter was commonest impaction. Many had persistent symptoms. N2  group had commonly coin impactions and strictures developed in long standing or  corrosive FBs. Most were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Abnormal esophageal anatomy  predisposes to impaction with organic food bolus. Age of presentation is earlier  with recurrent impactions requiring multiple dilatations/surgery and longer  follow-up. Metallic FBs commonly impact in normal esophagus and are often  innocuous. Atypical/multiple FBs may mirror an underlying psychiatric illness.},

The authors evaluated the accuracy of emergency physician (EP) performance of echocardiography in the assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and central venous pressure (CVP).               Methods:               The authors conducted a cross-sectional observational study at an urban teaching ED, involving a convenience sample of patients presenting to the ED between September 2000 and February 2001. Level III--credentialed EP sonographers who had undergone a three-hour training session in limited echocardiography, focusing on LVEF and CVP measurement, performed echocardiograms. Vital signs and indication for echocardiography were documented on a study data sheet. LVEF was rated as poor ({$<$}30\%), moderate (30\%--55\%), or normal ({$>$}55\%) and an absolute percentage. Central venous pressure categories included low ({$<$}5 cm), moderate (5--10 cm), and high ({$>$}10 cm). Formal echocardiograms were obtained within a four-hour window on all patients and interpreted by a staff cardiologist. Correlation analysis was performed using the               {$\kappa$}               correlation coefficient for LVEF and CVP categories and a Pearson correlation coefficient for LVEF measurement.               Results:               A total of 115 patients were assessed for LVEF, and 94 patients had complete information for CVP. Indications for echocardiography included chest pain (45.1\%), congestive heart failure (38.1\%), dyspnea (5.7\%), and endocarditis (10.6\%). Results showed a LVEF correlation of               r               2               = 0.712 with 86.1\% overall agreement. Subgroup analysis revealed the highest agreement (92.3\%) between EP and formal echocardiograms within the normal LVEF category, followed by 70.4\% agreement in the poor LVEF category and 47.8\% in the moderate LVEF category. Central venous pressure measurements resulted in 70.2\% overall raw agreement between EP and formal echocardiograms. Subgroup analysis revealed the highest agreement (83.3\%) within the high CVP category followed by 66.6\% in the moderate and 20\% in the low categories.               Conclusions:               Experienced EP sonographers with a small amount of focused additional training in limited bedside echocardiography can assess LVEF accurately in the ED.},

  abstract = {Objectives We investigated the effectiveness of early oral switch for treating Enterobacterales bloodstream infection (BSI) by performing a post hoc emulation trial of the SIMPLIFY trial. Methods We conducted a post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial. We specified the target trial characteristics selecting patients who achieved clinical stability on day 5. We categorized patients into those who switched on day 5 and those who continued intravenously. The primary outcome was clinical cure at the test of cure. We set a propensity score for being switched on day 5 to reduce confounding. We ran simple, not-propensity-adjusted, and propensity-adjusted logistic regression models to ascertain the association of switch on day 5 with clinical cure. Results Among 303 patients who achieved clinical stability on day 5, 110 (36.3\%) were switched orally on day 5, and 193 (63.7\%) were kept intravenously. We detected no difference in clinical cure between those switched on day 5 and those continued intravenously (risk ratios 1.04, 95\% confidence intervals [CI] 0.98-1.10). Propensity-adjusted analysis did not show an association between day 5 switch and clinical cure (OR 2.10, 95\% CI 0.96-7.41). Conclusion Oral step-down therapy on day 5 was not associated with worse clinical cure for Enterobacterales BSI.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Medication use may affect imaging results. In this case study, we report a case of lanthanum ingestion resulting in imaging consistent with ingested  metallic foreign bodies. SUMMARY: Hyperphosphatemia affects most patients with  end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with morbidity and mortality.  Lanthanum carbonate reduces daily phosphate absorption and is indicated as a  non-calcium-based phosphate binder in patients with ESRD. A 58-year-old man with  a medical history of stage 5 chronic kidney disease was admitted to the intensive  care unit (ICU) for hyperkalemia and acute respiratory failure after a missed  dialysis session. He required vasopressors, intubation, and continuous renal  replacement therapy. Admission imaging demonstrated several ingested metallic  foreign bodies within the colon. There was consideration of colorectal surgery  and gastroenterology consultation. On the initial medication reconciliation, no  medications that would have the radiographic appearance of ingested metallic  foreign bodies were identified. On further review of prescription data available  through the electronic medical record, it was noted that the patient had recently  filled a prescription for lanthanum despite its apparent discontinuation on a  previous admission. After interviewing the patient's wife, it was confirmed that  the patient had continued taking lanthanum and that he was swallowing it whole  and not chewing it. No consultations or interventions were performed, and the  metallic foreign bodies were no longer present on further imaging after a period  of 35 days. CONCLUSION: Escalation of care was avoided in this patient due to the  performance of diligent medication reconciliation and recognition of the impact  of lanthanum ingestion on imaging.},

Digital security simply hadn't been an NHS priority until WannaCry's infection became the biggest cy-berattack on critical infrastructure in U.K. history. For NHS staff, the attack was stressful, grueling, and exhausting not least for the legions of NHS IT workers who toiled all night to update and then patch thousands of health service systems. For doctors, it was a wake-up call. Underfunding ultimately left us horribly exposed to a predictable attack that threatened not just privacy but patient safety. If the WannaCry saga appears depressing, however-a realization of the perils of poorly funded health care-that was not the lesson we ultimately took from the experience. Facing adversity, with their backs against the wall, NHS staff quietly and resolutely got on with the job at hand. But although-through our resilience-our most vulnerable patients were able to pull through the crisis this time, we cannot be complacent and wait for a next time. All health care workers now have a responsibility to educate ourselves about this emerging threat and demand that funds be made available to ensure that the software we use is as up to date as the medicines we prescribe. We wouldn't accept being told to use outdated equipment on our patients, and our now-critical IT should be no different.},

Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital. Patients: Seven patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, seven patients with cardiogenic shock, and seven healthy volunteers. Interventions: 13C-labeled sodium lactate was infused at 10 {$\mu$}mol/kg/min and then at 20 {$\mu$}mol/kg/min over 120 mins each. 2H-labeled glucose was infused throughout. Measurements and Main Results: Baseline arterial lactate was higher in septic (3.2 {\textpm} 2.6) and cardiogenic shock patients (2.8 {\textpm} 0.4) than in healthy volunteers (0.9 {\textpm} 0.20 mmol/L, p {$<$} .05). Lactate clearance, computed using pharmacokinetic calculations, was similar in septic, cardiogenic shock, and controls, respectively: 10.8 {\textpm} 5.4, 9.6 {\textpm} 2.1, and 12.0 {\textpm} 2.6 mL/kg/min. Endogenous lactate production was determined as the initial lactate concentration multiplied by lactate clearance. It was markedly enhanced in the patients (septic 26.2 {\textpm} 10.5; cardiogenic shock 26.6 {\textpm} 5.1) compared with controls (11.2 {\textpm} 2.7 {$\mu$}mol/kg/min, p {$<$} .01). 13C-lactate oxidation (septic 54 {\textpm} 25; cardiogenic shock 43 {\textpm} 16; controls 65 {\textpm} 15\% of a lactate load of 10 {$\mu$}mol/kg/min) and transformation of 13C-lactate into 13C-glucose were not different (respectively, 15 {\textpm} 15, 9 {\textpm} 18, and 10 {\textpm} 7\%). Endogenous glucose production was markedly increased in the patients (septic 14.8 {\textpm} 1.8; cardiogenic shock 15.0 {\textpm} 1.5) compared with controls (7.2 {\textpm} 1.1 {$\mu$}mol/kg/min, p {$<$} .01) and was not influenced by lactate infusion. Conclusions: In patients suffering from septic or cardiogenic shock, hyperlactatemia was mainly related to increased production, whereas lactate clearance was similar to healthy subjects. Increased lactate production was concomitant to hyperglycemia and increased glucose turnover, suggesting that the latter substantially influences lactate metabolism during critical illness.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The ingestion of foreign bodies is a frequently observed problem in daily clinical practice. In order to avoid complications such as perforation,  endoscopic removal of potentially penetrating foreign bodies should be attempted  quickly. The use of various endoscopic techniques has been reported for this  purpose. However, extraction of foreign bodies from the mid gastrointestinal  tract has rarely been reported. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a patient who  had swallowed a safety needle which could safely be removed from the jejunum by  means of double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE). The combination of a thin p-type  enteroscope with a thick t-type overtube was used in order to improve the  manoeuvrability of the endoscope. The needle was pulled into the overtube which  served as a protective shield during the retrieval of the endoscope. CONCLUSION:  Our case report describes the potential of removing foreign bodies from the deep  small bowel by pulling them into the overtube of a double-balloon enteroscope. If  the suspicion of foreign body impaction in the small bowel is made, it may be  advisable to primarily choose a balloon enteroscopy system. Through this, quick  and deep insertion can be combined with a safe removal of the foreign body.},

We searched Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library on September 6, 2019. Two investigators screened titles and abstracts, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) template. We estimated prognostic test performance (sensitivity and specificity) and measures of association (odds ratio). Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology evaluated the certainty of evidence. Results: In total, 15 studies were included. We found wide variation across studies in the definition of `cardiac motion' and timing of sonographic assessment. Most studies were hindered by high risks of bias from prognostic factor measurement, outcome measurement, and lack of adjustment for other prognostic factors. Ultimately, heterogeneity and risk of bias precluded meta-analyses. We tabulated ranges of prognostic test performance and measures of association for 5 different combinations of definitions of `cardiac motion' and sonographic timing, as well as other miscellaneous sonographic findings. Overall certainty of this evidence is very low. Conclusions: The evidence for using point-of-care echocardiography as a prognostic tool for clinical outcomes during cardiac arrest is of very low certainty and is hampered by multiple risks of bias. No sonographic finding had sufficient and/or consistent sensitivity for any clinical outcome to be used as sole criterion to terminate resuscitation.},

This potentially severe problem had a peak  incidence in children aged 6 months to 6 years. Intentional adult cases are  voluntary and more common in prisoners and people with psychiatric problems.  However, most patients (90\%) remain asymptomatic, and these pass through the body  spontaneously. CASE PRESENTATION: The authors report a case of surgically  removing plenteous sharp-pointed metallic foreign bodies ingested by a young male  deaf-mute bipolar schizoaffective patient from his stomach, intestine, and  rectum. Furthermore, the authors have reviewed the available literature for  similar cases. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Less than 1\% of patients need surgical  removal, 10-20\% need to be taken out endoscopically, and the remaining pass  spontaneously. Plain radiography is the most available imaging modality detecting  the number, material, and estimated place of the alimentary canal trapped.  CONCLUSION: For the risk of perforation, migration, and peritonitis, surgery is  indicated in such situations.},

Foreign body ingestions in prisoners are always intentional and  inmates can be manipulative, which makes medical decision even more difficult.  Our objective is to propose a decisional algorithm for management of foreign body  ingestion in prisoners. We reviewed the records of 198 admissions for foreign  body ingestion for a 10-year period. Type and number of ingested foreign bodies,  radiographic findings, outcome as well as the management method including  conservative, endoscopic removal, or surgical treatment were analyzed. Most cases  were managed conservatively (87.6\%). Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal  tract was performed in 37 cases with a success rate of 46 per cent. In 9.3 per  cent of cases, the final treatment was endoscopic. Only five patients required  surgical treatment, being emergent just in one case. We advocate conservative  treatment for asymptomatic patients with foreign body ingestion. Endoscopic  removal is proposed for pointed objects or objects bigger than 2.5 cm located in  the stomach. Objects longer than 6 to 8 cm located in the stomach should be  removed by endoscopy or laparoscopy. Patients with objects in the small bowel or  colon should be treated conservatively unless there are complications or they  fail to progress.},

  abstract = {Aim: To compare the radiation dose of cervical spine clearance and body CT in a cohort of unconscious, major trauma patients for three different protocols, comparing spiral to multislice CT. To quantify the radiation exposure effect of the protocols on the lifetime cancer risk. Method: The hospital trauma database was used to find the unconscious (GCS {$<$} 9), severely injured (Injury Severity Score {$>$}15) from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2003, excluding isolated head injuries. The protocols used for imaging the brain and cervical spine were, including the radiographs performed as a mode:(1)Three cervical radiographs (lateral, antero-posterior and open-mouth peg views) and CT of the brain and cranio-cervical junction.(2)CT of the brain, cranio-cervical and the cervico-dorsal junctions with two radiographs (lateral and antero-posterior).(3)A lateral radiograph and CT of the brain and whole cervical spine. The dose of the initial body CT was recorded. The exposure factors and field of view used were put into the Monte Carlo software, to estimate the CT and radiographic X-ray doses to the body as a whole and the dose to the thyroid associated with each region imaged. The associated nominal additional lifetime cancer risk was assessed. Results: Excluding inter hospital transfers, where data was incomplete, 87 patients survived to be admitted and fulfilled the criteria. In 30 cases, the CT films were missing, the exposure factors were not recorded or no imaging was performed. In a further 21 cases, the X-ray packets were missing. Three patients had brain and cervico-dorsal CT imaging only, leaving 33 cases for evaluation. The effective radiation dose for a spiral CT of the brain using the Toshiba Xpress GX CT scanner was 3.8 mSv. The total effective doses for imaging the brain and cervical spine using the three protocols with the same CT scanner were (S.D. as \% of mean): (1) 4.4 mSv (5\%), (2) 7.1 mSv (10\%) and (3) 8.2 mSv (15\%). The corresponding mean thyroid doses were: (1) 8.5 mGy (25\%), (2) 48.9 mGy (20\%) and (3) 66.5 mSv (20\%). The resultant nominal lifetime cancer risks were: (1) 1:4500, (2) 1:2800 and (3) 1:2400. For the Siemens Sensation 16 multislice CT scanner, the total effective doses (S.D. as \% of mean) were: (1) 2.3 mSv (10\%), (2) 4.3 mSv (25\%) and (3) 5.4 mSv (35\%). The mean doses to the thyroid were: (1) 5.9 mGy (30\%), (2) 36.1 mGy (50\%) and (3) 52.4 mGy (40\%). The lifetime cancer risks were: (1) 1:8700, (2) 1:4600 and (3) 1:3700. Using the Toshiba spiral CT scanner, the total dose and additional lifetime nominal cancer risk associated with CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis (CAP) as 16 mSv and 1:1250, respectively. Using the Siemens multislice CT scanner, these were 11.8 mSv and 1:1700. The cancer risk for protocol 1 when combined with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was 1:1000 for the spiral CT scanner and 1:1500 for the multislice CT (MCT) scanner. The cancer risk for protocol 2 with CAP CT using the MCT was 1:1200. The cancer risk for protocol 3 when combined with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was 1:1100 for the multislice CT scanner. Prior to the introduction of the BTS guidelines for cervical clearance, 12\% of cases had CT of the body, which increased to 16\% post-guidelines. Conclusions: CT of the trunk (chest, abdomen and pelvis) is associated with the greatest risk of inducing a fatal cancer in the severely injured patient with a GCS less than 9. In our institution the multislice CT protocols expose the patient to less radiation than single slice CT, which is contrary to much of the published work to date. CT scanning the thyroid (or whole cervical spine) still has a marked effect on the cancer risk in cervical clearance. Many centres will relax cervical spinal precautions in unconscious trauma patients if the cervical spine CT with reconstructions is normal. CT of the whole cervical spine may be justified in the unconscious, severely injured patient. In conscious trauma patients, the additional lifetime risk may not justify CT of the whole cervical spine as a routine practice. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Obtaining information on current child injury trends and their associated issues is an important factor in developing products that meet or surpass acceptable toy  safety boundaries. Understanding these boundaries helps determine safe product  design characteristics that reduce the risk of product-related injury. Inchcape  Testing Services developed a Small Parts Aspiration, Ingestion, and Choking  Hazards Research Project, independent of an ongoing consumer Product Safety  Commission (CPSC) project. The project's purpose was to determine, independent of  CPSC, whether a more stringent small parts regulatory standard was necessary and,  if so, to ensure that the standard was determined objectively. This article  reports on the project's findings relating to critical characteristics (size,  shape, and consistency) relative to the victim's age, of objects responsible for  child choking injuries and fatalities.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate findings at serial MRI after endoscopic removal of a button battery from the esophagus in a series of  pediatric patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Serial MRI examinations after removal  of a button battery from the esophagus were reviewed retrospectively for the  presence of mediastinal edema; imaging characteristics of the aorta and arteries;  imaging characteristics of the trachea; and imaging characteristics of the  esophageal wall at the level of injury. RESULTS. A total of 48 MRI examinations  were performed on 19 patients, 89\% (17/19) in the first 48 hours after battery  removal. Serial MRI was performed for 84\% (16/19) of patients. Initial MRI showed  extensive mediastinal edema in all 17 patients who underwent MRI in the first 48  hours. Edema directly abutted major arteries in all 17 patients and abutted the  airway in all 10 patients with proximal esophageal injury. Arterial vascular  changes were seen in 30\% (3/10) of patients with proximal esophageal injury and  57\% (4/7) of patients with mid or distalesophageal injury. Airway changes were  seen in 80\% (8/10) of patients with proximal esophageal injury. Serial MRI showed  improvement of airway changes in all patients and improvement in vessel wall  changes in all but one (25\%, 1/4) of the patients who had mid or distal  esophageal injury. Four patients (21\% [4/19]) had contained esophageal leak on  esophagrams. No patients in our series developed a tracheoesophageal or  vascular-enteric fistula. CONCLUSION. Our case series provides important  information on natural history of MRI findings in children after endoscopic  removal of a button battery from the esophagus. Further studies are needed to  determine the imaging findings most sensitive and specific for severe  complications, such as tracheoesophageal fistula and vascular-enteric fistula.},

Removal through  flexible endoscopy is generally the first-line approach but rescue oesophagotomy  may be necessary for foreign bodies impacted in the upper oesophagus. A  27-year-old man was admitted in the emergency room after intentional ingestion of  a wooden spherical object with a central hole. A total body CT scan showed that  the object was completely obstructing the upper oesophageal lumen but there were  no signs of perforation. In the operating room, a Weerda diverticuloscope and a  5\,mm 0{$^\circ$} telescope were used to visualise the foreign body under general  anaesthesia. A standard endoscopic biopsy forceps was passed through the hole of  the sphere and was retracted with the jaws open allowing transoral extraction  without complications.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Several clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have been produced to optimize the diagnosis and management of pediatric foreign body aspiration and  ingestion. However, to date there have been no critical evaluations of their  methodological rigor or quality. Herein, we address this need via the Appraisal  of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument. METHODS: A  literature search of Embase, MEDLINE via PubMed, and Scopus was performed up  until February 25, 2021. Identified CPGs were then assessed by four independent  reviewers trained in AGREE II. A scaled domain score of {$>$}60\% was indicated as  satisfactory quality. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated  to assess inter-reviewer agreement. RESULTS: 11 guidelines were assessed with  only one being classified as high quality and others being either average (two)  or low quality (eight). Domain 4 (clarity of presentation) achieved the highest  mean score (66.41~{\textpm}~13.33\%), while domain 5 (applicability) achieved the lowest  score (10.80~{\textpm}~10.37\%). ICC analysis revealed generally strong agreement between  reviewers with a range of 0.60-0.98. CONCLUSION: Quality appraisal using the  AGREE II instrument suggests that the methodologic rigor and quality of current  guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pediatric foreign body aspiration  and ingestion need significant improvement.},

Although endoscopic removal of foreign bodies is generally safe, it is not always clearly indicated. Foreign bodies in the esophagus usually require prompt intervention. In contrast, objects are frequently retained in the gastric lumen for long periods without adverse consequences. Psychotic or demented patients are a major adult group at risk for foreign body ingestion. Because endoscopy in this group often carries additional risks, and since smooth objects are usually well tolerated in the stomach for long periods, we recommend a conservative approach in this circumstance.},

  abstract = {Background: Tranexamic acid reduces surgical bleeding and reduces death due to bleeding in patients with trauma. Meta-analyses of small trials show that tranexamic acid might decrease deaths from gastrointestinal bleeding. We aimed to assess the effects of tranexamic acid in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. Methods: We did an international, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 164 hospitals in 15 countries. Patients were enrolled if the responsible clinician was uncertain whether to use tranexamic acid, were aged above the minimum age considered an adult in their country (either aged 16 years and older or aged 18 years and older), and had significant (defined as at risk of bleeding to death) upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients were randomly assigned by selection of a numbered treatment pack from a box containing eight packs that were identical apart from the pack number. Patients received either a loading dose of 1 g tranexamic acid, which was added to 100 mL infusion bag of 0{$\cdot$}9\% sodium chloride and infused by slow intravenous injection over 10 min, followed by a maintenance dose of 3 g tranexamic acid added to 1 L of any isotonic intravenous solution and infused at 125 mg/h for 24 h, or placebo (sodium chloride 0{$\cdot$}9\%). Patients, caregivers, and those assessing outcomes were masked to allocation. The primary outcome was death due to bleeding within 5 days of randomisation; analysis excluded patients who received neither dose of the allocated treatment and those for whom outcome data on death were unavailable. This trial was registered with Current Controlled Trials, ISRCTN11225767, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01658124. Findings: Between July 4, 2013, and June 21, 2019, we randomly allocated 12 009 patients to receive tranexamic acid (5994, 49{$\cdot$}9\%) or matching placebo (6015, 50{$\cdot$}1\%), of whom 11 952 (99{$\cdot$}5\%) received the first dose of the allocated treatment. Death due to bleeding within 5 days of randomisation occurred in 222 (4\%) of 5956 patients in the tranexamic acid group and in 226 (4\%) of 5981 patients in the placebo group (risk ratio [RR] 0{$\cdot$}99, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}82--1{$\cdot$}18). Arterial thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction or stroke) were similar in the tranexamic acid group and placebo group (42 [0{$\cdot$}7\%] of 5952 vs 46 [0{$\cdot$}8\%] of 5977; 0{$\cdot$}92; 0{$\cdot$}60 to 1{$\cdot$}39). Venous thromboembolic events (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) were higher in tranexamic acid group than in the placebo group (48 [0{$\cdot$}8\%] of 5952 vs 26 [0{$\cdot$}4\%] of 5977; RR 1{$\cdot$}85; 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}15 to 2{$\cdot$}98). Interpretation: We found that tranexamic acid did not reduce death from gastrointestinal bleeding. On the basis of our results, tranexamic acid should not be used for the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding outside the context of a randomised trial.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ingestion of sharp foreign bodies is a less frequently encountered method of selfharm. This study aims to follow up patients presenting with foreign body (FB) ingestion requiring urgent endoscopic intervention under general anaesthetic in theatre, characterise each patient and establish whether admission or removal of the FB promotes further self-harm. METHOD: Eleven adult patients, totalling 38 presentations over a 28-month period were identified. Each was followed up from an initial presentation requiring endoscopy. RESULT: 9/11 (81.9\%) where transferred either from prison or psychiatric care with an extensive history of multimodal and usually violent self-harm. Of these 8/9 (88.9\%) had a formal psychiatric diagnosis linked to their previous self-harm. Objects retrieved included pens, razor blades, cutlery, wiring, batteries, a metal screw and a TV aerial. The median time between presentations with self-harm was 11 days. Those discharged from the emergency department re-presented after a median of 7.5 days. This was longer, at 14 days, if admitted to hospital; with those having endoscopic procedures re-presenting after a median of 11 days. CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient endoscopic removal of the FB was not associated with an earlier presentation with further self-harm when compared with discharge straight form A+E, but was frequently repeated, often in a characterised manner.},

All reported high levels of mental health problems in detainees. Anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder were commonly reported, as were self-harm and suicidal ideation. Time in detention was positively associated with severity of distress. There is evidence for an initial improvement in mental health occurring subsequent to release, although longitudinal results have shown that the negative impact of detention persists.ConclusionsThis area of research is in its infancy and studies are limited by methodological constraints. Findings consistently report high levels of mental health problems among detainees. There is some evidence to suggest an independent adverse effect of detention on mental health.},

Recently, its use has increased for a variety of clinical indications. To guide clinical practice, we developed evidence-based recommendations regarding use of HFNC in various clinical settings. Methods:{\enspace} We formed a guideline panel composed of clinicians, methodologists and experts in respiratory medicine. Using GRADE, the panel developed recommendations for four actionable questions. Results:{\enspace} The guideline panel made a strong recommendation for HFNC in hypoxemic respiratory failure compared to conventional oxygen therapy (COT) (moderate certainty), a conditional recommendation for HFNC following extuba-tion (moderate certainty), no recommendation regarding HFNC in the peri-intubation period (moderate certainty), and a conditional recommendation for postoperative HFNC in high risk and/or obese patients following cardiac or thoracic surgery (moderate certainty). Conclusions:{\enspace} This clinical practice guideline synthesizes current best-evidence into four recommendations for HFNC use in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, following extubation, in the peri-intubation period, and postopera-tively for bedside clinicians.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The discovery of foreign bodies (FB) in the rectum is an infrequent clinical problem. Most commonly, FB are introduced through the anal passage or  reach the rectum after oral ingestion. We describe our experience in the  diagnosis and treatment of FB retained in the rectum. METHOD: From 1997 to 2004,  data were collected prospectively in 30 patients (20 men and 10 women; median age  42.5 years). Extraction method, size and type of object, and postextraction  evolution were reviewed. RESULTS: The FB was introduced anally in 16 cases and by  oral ingestion in 14. Principal associated factors were: mental disorder in 11,  penitentiary confinement in two, and drug and alcohol intake in two. Recent  sexual activity had taken place in 14 cases. The size and nature of the FB were  varied. The most frequent symptom was constipation with or without pelvic or anal  discomfort (n = 23, 77\%). Treatment consisted of spontaneous ejection (n = 2),  digital extraction with or without enemas (n = 10), digital extraction under  local/regional anaesthesia after fragmentation (n = 11) and regional exploratory  laparotomy under general anaesthesia (n = 7). Grade I rectal trauma was the most  common (n = 23, 77\%). Six patients required colostomy. Four patients (13.5\%)  suffered complications and none died. Only 17 patients were hospitalized, with a  mean stay of 6 days. All patients recovered without sequelae. CONCLUSION: The  diagnosis of rectal FB should be suspected when faced with low pelvic or perianal  abdominal pain and/or rectal haemorrhage within the context of an unconvincing  story in patients without a history of recent instrumental rectal exploration for  therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. Because of potential complications, FB in the  rectum should be considered a serious condition that must be treated without  delay.},

METHOD: From 1995 to 2006, data were collected prospectively in 33 patients (18 women and 15 men; mean age 64 years) operated on for intestinal perforation due to an ingested FB. The type of object, preoperative diagnosis, perforation site, treatment, morbidity and mortality were reviewed. RESULTS: Foreign body ingestion was predominantly involuntary (88\%). The mean time from ingestion to perforation was 10.4 days. The most frequently ingested objects were dietary FB (n = 21) and toothpicks (n = 6). The most frequent predisposing factors were dentures or an orthodontic appliance (73\%). The most common preoperative diagnoses were acute abdomen of uncertain origin (n = 7), acute appendicitis (n = 7) and acute diverticulitis (n = 5). Pneumoperitoneum was observed in 10 cases. The diagnosis was reached during laparotomy in 30 (91\%) cases. The most frequent perforation site was the colorectal region (n = 18, 54.5\%), followed by the terminal ileum (n = 7, 21.2\%); intraperitoneal perforation was the most common (n = 30, 91\%). All cases had abdominal contamination and 22 (66.7\%) had diffuse peritonitis. Treatment was always by surgery and antibiotics. Thirteen patients required a colostomy. Morbidity was 57.6\% (n = 19) and mortality 6.1\% (n = 2). CONCLUSION: Intestinal perforation by a foreign body is rare and normally affects the sigmoid colon, rectum or distal ileum. Dentures are a common risk factor. Patients are rarely aware of foreign body ingestion. Dietary FB and toothpicks are the most commonly ingested objects. Treatment consists of surgery and antibiotics. Appendicitis and acute diverticulitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Study Objective: Vasodilatory shock is the most common type of shock. Catecholamine vasopressors are the cornerstone of hemodynamic therapy but carry risks. Angiotensin II (AT2) was recently approved, and other novel agents (selepressin and terlipressin) are under investigation and used outside the United States (terlipressin). We performed a systematic review to summarize the efficacy and safety of these novel vasopressors and to offer guidance on their appropriate use. Design: Systematic review of controlled trials. Methods: Numerous databases were searched using terms related to angiotensin II, selepressin, terlipressin, vasopressor, and shock. Twenty-one citations, including 16 prospective comparative trials and 5 post hoc analyses reporting effects of AT2, selepressin, and terlipressin, were reviewed for data on outcomes related to hemodynamic measures, mortality, severity and duration of illness, concomitant vasopressor utilization, and adverse effects. Findings from eligible literature are described qualitatively using Cochrane methods. Results: Fourteen controlled trials were assessed after exclusion of 2 dated trials of a distinct AT2 formulation. Trials are limited for AT2 (n = 2) and selepressin (n = 1), while terlipressin was investigated in 11 small trials. Overall, the trials have an unclear risk of bias. Most report mean arterial pressure (MAP) as primary end point, and all indicate novel vasopressors increase MAP compared to placebo and to a similar degree as with catecholamine vasopressors. Mortality findings are preliminary, as they have been limited to specific subgroups in trials of terlipressin and post hoc analyses of one trial of AT2. Trials reported safety concerns for each agent including thromboembolism with AT2 and ischemia with terlipressin/selepressin. Conclusion: In this systematic review, controlled trials of novel vasopressors in treatment of vasodilatory shock were limited and of low quality. Angiotensin II, selepressin, and terlipressin appear to significantly increase MAP, but further study is required, particularly for selepressin, to determine their safety, efficacy, and role in treatment of vasodilatory shock.},

METHODS: We analyzed data from all patients treated for DB  ingestion at our hospital from June 2010 to January 2024. A protocol established  in 2010 requires angio-CT scans for esophageal DB cases and a multidisciplinary  approach involving gastroenterologists, otolaryngologists, pediatric and airway  surgeons, and cardiac surgeons. RESULTS: We treated 22 patients. In June 2010,  following the tragic death of a patient from an undiagnosed DB ingestion that led  to an aortoesophageal fistula, our protocol was established. All DBs were removed  endoscopically. Four patients needed additional surgery: two had tracheal  resection/anastomosis and esophageal repair for large tracheoesophageal fistulas;  one required aortic wall reinforcement with a patch; one underwent endoscopic  removal with a sternal split to explore the aortic arch. All 22 patients survived  and recovered clinically. One developed bilateral vocal cord palsy as a  complication. CONCLUSION: Effective management of DB ingestion complications  necessitates a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach. Our protocol has  improved management strategies and patient outcomes.},

A prototypical vagus nerve circuit, the inflammatory reflex, inhibits tumor necrosis factor--{$\alpha$} production in spleen by a mechanism requiring acetylcholine signaling through the {$\alpha$}7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expressed on cytokine-producing macrophages. Nerve fibers in spleen lack the enzymatic machinery necessary for acetylcholine production; therefore, how does this neural circuit terminate in cholinergic signaling? We identified an acetylcholine-producing, memory phenotype T cell population in mice that is integral to the inflammatory reflex. These acetylcholine-producing T cells are required for inhibition of cytokine production by vagus nerve stimulation. Thus, action potentials originating in the vagus nerve regulate T cells, which in turn produce the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, required to control innate immune responses.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To review current management and outcomes of ingested batteries and develop a clinical management algorithm. METHODS: Children {$<$}18years old who  ingested a battery between 1/2011 and 9/2016 at two tertiary care children's  hospitals were reviewed. Demographics, imaging, management and outcomes were  analyzed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square and Wilcoxon Rank-sum tests.  RESULTS: There were 180 battery ingestions. The median age was 3.9 (range 0.7-18)  years, with 78 (43\%) males. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain (17\%)  and nausea/vomiting (14\%). Diagnosis was confirmed with plain radiographs in 170  (94\%) patients. Locations on imaging were: stomach (37\%), small bowel (24\%),  esophagus (18\%), colon (11\%), and non-specific location past the gastroesophageal  junction (9\%). Treatment was dictated by five different subspecialties including  surgery (35\%), gastroenterology (25\%), emergency medicine (19\%), primary  care/emergency with a consulting service (13\%), and otolaryngology (8\%). All  esophageal batteries (n=33) had an intervention. Interventions included  fluoroscopic balloon extraction (6 attempted, 33\% retrieval rate), rigid  esophagoscopy (26 attempted, 96\% retrieval rate), and EGD (6 attempted, 83\%  retrieval rate). For batteries distal to the gastroesophageal junction 16 (11\%)  patients had an intervention. Interventions included EGD (13 patients, 69\%  retrieval), colonoscopy (1 patient, successful retrieval), and abdominal surgery  in two patients. CONCLUSION: Isolated batteries that pass the gastroesophageal  junction rarely require intervention and can be managed conservatively. Given the  variability in managing these patients, we developed an evidence based algorithm.  LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 2. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective Study.},

Relevant papers were primarily investigated with respect to data sampling procedures and methods for statistical analysis. It was uniformly reported that fatality risk increased monotonically with car impact speed. However, the absolute risk estimates varied considerably. Without exceptions, papers written before 2000 were based on direct analyses of data that had a large bias towards severe and fatal injuries. The consequence was to overestimate the fatality risks. We also found more recent research based on less biased data or adjusted for bias. While still showing a steep increase of risk with impact speed, these later papers provided substantially lower risk estimates than had been previously reported.},

  abstract = {The use of ultrasound for the investigation of urgent diagnostic dilemmas is by no means new. Although it has been widely used for almost 40 years, during the past two decades ultrasound has achieved a primary role in the investigation of emergent conditions, notably in the trauma setting. This is further underscored by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) training initiatives. In addition to the basic ultrasound course sponsored by the ACS at the Clinical Congress meetings, the ACS will offer a specialty module course, "Ultrasound in the Acute Setting," that covers ultrasound as used in trauma, critical care, and acute general surgical problems. This initiative underscores the surgeons' interest in having ultrasound as an integral part of their trauma practice. Having the ability to perform and interpret the ultrasound examination gives the surgeon the advantage of obtaining immediate information about the patient. Considering the pace of the trauma setting, ultrasound is an ideal modality for assessment of these patients. It should be the initial diagnostic test for the evaluation of patients with precordial wounds and blunt truncal injuries because it is rapid and accurate, and it augments the surgeon's diagnostic capabilities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditional fluid resuscitation strategy in the actively hemorrhaging trauma patient emphasizes maintenance of a normal systolic blood pressure (SBP). One human trial has demonstrated improved survival when fluid resuscitation is restricted, whereas numerous laboratory studies have reported improved survival when resuscitation is directed to a lower than normal pressure. We hypothesized that fluid resuscitation titrated to a lower than normal SBP during the period of active hemorrhage would improve survival in trauma patients presenting to the hospital in hemorrhagic shock. METHODS: Patients presenting in hemorrhagic shock were randomized to one of two fluid resuscitation protocols: target SBP {$>$} 100 mm Hg (conventional) or target SBP of 70 mm Hg (low). Fluid therapy was titrated to this endpoint until definitive hemostasis was achieved. In-hospital mortality, injury severity, and probability of survival were determined for each patient. RESULTS: One hundred ten patients were enrolled over 20 months, 55 in each group. The study cohort had a mean age of 31 years, and consisted of 79\% male patients and 51\% penetrating trauma victims. There was a significant difference in SBP observed during the study period (114 mm Hg vs. 100 mm Hg, p {$<$} 0.001). Injury Severity Score (19.65 +/- 11.8 vs. 23.64 +/- 13.8, p = 0.11) and the duration of active hemorrhage (2.97 +/- 1.75 hours vs. 2.57 +/- 1.46 hours, p = 0.20) were not different between groups. Overall survival was 92.7\%, with four deaths in each group. CONCLUSION: Titration of initial fluid therapy to a lower than normal SBP during active hemorrhage did not affect mortality in this study. Reasons for the decreased overall mortality and the lack of differentiation between groups likely include improvements in diagnostic and therapeutic technology, the heterogeneous nature of human traumatic injuries, and the imprecision of SBP as a marker for tissue oxygen delivery.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether administering mechanical chest compressions with defibrillation during ongoing compressions (mechanical CPR), compared with manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (manual CPR), according to guidelines, would improve 4-hour survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter randomized clinical trial of 2589 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest conducted between January 2008 and February 2013 in 4 Swedish, 1 British, and 1 Dutch ambulance services and their referring hospitals. Duration of follow-up was 6 months. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to receive either mechanical chest compressions (LUCAS Chest Compression System, Physio-Control/Jolife AB) combined with defibrillation during ongoing compressions (n = 1300) or to manual CPR according to guidelines (n = 1289). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Four-hour survival, with secondary end points of survival up to 6 months with good neurological outcome using the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score. A CPC score of 1 or 2 was classified as a good outcome. RESULTS Four-hour survival was achieved in 307 patients (23.6\%) with mechanical CPR and 305 (23.7\%) with manual CPR (risk difference, --0.05\%; 95\% CI, --3.3\% to 3.2\%; P {$>$} .99). Survival with a CPC score of 1 or 2 occurred in 98 (7.5\%) vs 82 (6.4\%) (risk difference, 1.18\%; 95\% CI, --0.78\% to 3.1\%) at intensive care unit discharge, in 108 (8.3\%) vs 100 (7.8\%) (risk difference, 0.55\%; 95\% CI, --1.5\% to 2.6\%) at hospital discharge, in 105 (8.1\%) vs 94 (7.3\%) (risk difference, 0.78\%; 95\% CI, --1.3\% to 2.8\%) at 1 month, and in 110 (8.5\%) vs 98 (7.6\%) (risk difference, 0.86\%; 95\% CI, --1.2\% to 3.0\%) at 6 months with mechanical CPR and manual CPR, respectively. Among patients surviving at 6 months, 99\% in the mechanical CPR group and 94\% in the manual CPR group had CPC scores of 1 or 2. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, there was no significant difference in 4-hour survival between patients treated with the mechanical CPR algorithm or those treated with guideline-adherent manual CPR. The vast majority of survivors in both groups had good neurological outcomes by 6 months. In clinical practice, mechanical CPR using the presented algorithm did not result in improved effectiveness compared with manual CPR.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The primary goal of this study was to determine accuracy for diagnosing acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in the undifferentiated dyspneic emergency department (ED) patient using a lung and cardiac ultrasound (LuCUS) protocol. Secondary objectives were to determine if US findings acutely change management and if findings are more accurate than clinical gestalt. Methods: This was a prospective, observational study of adult patients presenting to the ED with undifferentiated dyspnea. The intervention consisted of a 12-view LuCUS protocol performed by experienced emergency physician sonographers. The primary objective was measured by comparing US findings to the final diagnosis independently determined by two physicians blinded to the LuCUS result. Acute treatment changes based on US findings were tracked in real time through a standardized data collection form. Results: Data on 99 patients were analyzed; ADHF was the final diagnosis in 36\%. The LuCUS protocol had sensitivity of 83\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 67\% to 93\%), specificity of 83\% (95\% CI = 70\% to 91\%), positive likelihood ratio of 4.8 (95\% CI = 2.7 to 8.3), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.20 (95\% CI = 0.09 to 0.42). Forty-seven percent of patients had changes in acute management, and 42\% had changes in acute treatment. Observed agreement for the LuCUS protocol was 93\% between coinvestigators. Overall, accuracy improved by 20\% (83\% vs. 63\%, 95\% CI = 8\% to 31\% for the difference) over clinical gestalt alone. Conclusions: The LuCUS protocol may accurately identify ADHF and may improve acute clinical management in dyspneic ED patients. This protocol has improved diagnostic accuracy over clinical gestalt alone.},

During the first  year, standard emergency room triage (ST) was used. During the second year, the  triage protocol was changed and Trauma I triage (TT) was used. RESULTS: 24  children had suspected button battery ingestions with 11 having esophageal  impaction. One esophageal impaction was due to 2 stacked coins. Time from arrival  in emergency room to battery removal was 183minutes in ST group (n=4) and  33minutes in TT group (n=7) (p=0.04). One patient in ST developed a  tracheoesophageal fistula. There were no complications in the TT group.  CONCLUSIONS: The use of Trauma 1 activations for suspected button battery  ingestions has led to more expedient evaluation and shortened time to removal of  impacted esophageal batteries.},

Both rigid (RE) and flexible (FE) endoscopic techniques are used for  removal of esophageal FBs; however, there is no consensus amongst pediatric  surgeons regarding the best method. This study reviewed our experience managing  esophageal FBs using both techniques. METHODS: A 12-year retrospective review of  children admitted with an esophageal FB between 1999 and 2012 was undertaken.  Clinical data, management techniques, and complications were abstracted.  Differences between these two groups were compared with standard statistical  methods. RESULTS: 657 children were treated for esophageal FB ingestion, of which  366 (56\%) were treated with FE. The most frequently ingested item was a coin  (84\%), and FBs were most commonly lodged in the upper third of the esophagus  (78\%). There was a slightly younger population in the FE group (4.0 vs. 3.3  years, p {$<$} 0.01), but otherwise no significant differences were found between the  groups. The FB was successfully removed with the initially chosen technique in  97\% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal FBs may be successfully removed with  either RE or FE. Since treatment failures were managed with conversion to the  other technique, both procedures should be included in the training curriculum.},

We measured 39 cytokines to compare patients with lactate less than or equal to 2 versus greater than 2 mmol/L. Patients: Patients with septic shock with lactate greater than 2 mmol/L or less than or equal to 2 mmol/L, randomized to vasopressin or norepinephrine. Interventions: Concealed vasopressin (0.03 U/min.) or norepinephrine infusions. Measurements and Main Results: The Septic Shock 3.0 definition would have decreased sample size by about half. The 28- and 90-day mortality rates were 10--12 \% higher than the original Vasopressin and Septic Shock Trial mortality. There was a significantly (p = 0.028) lower mortality with vasopressin versus norepinephrine in lactate less than or equal to 2 mmol/L but no difference between treatment groups in lactate greater than 2 mmol/L. Nearly all cytokine levels were significantly higher in patients with lactate greater than 2 versus less than or equal to 2 mmol/L. Conclusions: The Septic Shock 3.0 definition decreased sample size by half and increased 28-day mortality rates by about 10\%. Vasopressin lowered mortality versus norepinephrine if lactate was less than or equal to 2 mmol/L. Patients had higher plasma cytokines in lactate greater than 2 versus less than or equal to 2 mmol/L, a brisker cytokine response to infection. The Septic Shock 3.0 definition and our findings have important implications for trial design in septic shock. (Crit Care Med 2017; 45:940--948)},

  abstract = {Background Guidelines for adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected sepsis recommend protocols and bundles that promote rapid and potentially intensive treatment, but give little consideration of how patient characteristics, such as age, functional status and comorbidities, might influence management. This study aimed to describe the characteristics, management and outcomes of adults attending the ED with suspected sepsis, and specifically describe the prevalence of comorbidities, functional impairment and escalations of care. Methods We undertook a single-centre retrospective observational study involving medical record review of a random sample of adults admitted to an ED between February 2018 and January 2019 with suspected sepsis. Descriptive statistics were used with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for key proportions. Results We included 509 patients (median age 74 years), of whom 49.3\% met the Sepsis-3 criteria. Less than half of the patients were living at home independently (42.5\%) or could walk independently (41.5\%), 19.3\% were care home residents and 89.2\% of patients had one or more comorbidity. 22\% had a pre-existing do not attempt resuscitation order. 6.5\% were referred to intensive care, and 34.3\% of the 13.2\% who died in-hospital had an escalation plan explicitly documented. Conclusion Adults with suspected sepsis have substantial functional limitations, comorbidities and treatment directives that should be considered in guidelines, especially recommendations for escalation of care.},

  abstract = {Choking (or foreign body airway obstruction) is a widespread phenomenon with serious consequences of morbidity and mortality. Choking (often also called  suffocation) can be caused by food or inedible objects and leads to various  degrees of asphyxiation or lack of oxygen in the blood stream. The incidence is  very high in both young children and adults, especially seniors. However, since  not all choking episodes end up in the emergency room or become fatalities, they  often escape statistics. Although episodes of choking from non-edible bodies are  infrequent, they affect mostly young children. Three of the most common risks for  choking in general are neurological disorders, dysphagia and dental issues (few  or no teeth, unstable or unsuitable prosthesis or orthodontic appliances).~ The  purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk factors of choking and ways to  reduce/avoid this event. We reported data on a series of 138 patients admitted to  the emergency department following a choking event, at a hospital in Rome, Italy.  The age group of the analyzed population ranged from 1 to 88 years, with the most  represented age group of these between 40 and 59, with a similar distribution  between males and females. The types of foods on which people choked reflected  the seasonal, traditional and local foods: 67\% of patients reported choking on  fish bones followed by meat bones (9\%)~ and artichokes (3\%). Three relevant  non-food choking elements reported were: orthodontic items, toothpicks and pins  (one occurrence each). We also reported on two clinical cases of patients choking  on meat and a chicken bone. In conclusion, choking awareness and prevention are  essential for implementing potential life-saving precautions. Prevention is the  first tool to reduce the occurrence of this event, therefore it is necessary to  analyze the risk factors and educate the population to eliminate them. Proper  chewing and oral manipulation are paramount functions in preventing choking,  along with meal-time supervision if little children and elderly. Then, it  behooves the healthcare professionals to disseminate knowledge.},

  abstract = {Background Timely intervention is essential for the successful removal of ingested foreign bodies. Emergent endoscopy (EGD) is usually performed in the emergency department (ED), operating room (OR), intensive care unit (ICU), or endoscopy suite. However, because the endoscopy suite is not always available, this study investigated the impact of location outside of the endoscopy suite on the successful removal of ingested foreign bodies and other patient outcomes. Methodology We reviewed charts of patients who underwent EGD for foreign body removal at an academic quaternary center between January 01, 2012, and December 31, 2020. We defined successful EGD as retrieval of the foreign body at the first attempt and not requiring subsequent endoscopy or surgical intervention. We performed descriptive and inferential statistical analyses and conducted classification and regression trees to compare endoscopy procedure length (EPL) and hospital length of stay (HLOS) between different locations. Results We analyzed 77 patients, of whom 13 (17\%) underwent endoscopy in the ICU, 46 (60\%) in the OR, and 18 (23\%) in the ED. Endoscopic removal failed in four (5\%) patients. Endoscopy length was significantly shorter in the OR (67 (48-122) minutes) versus the ICU (158 (95-166) minutes, P = 0.004) and the ED (111 (92-155) minutes, P = 0.009). Time to procedure was similar if the procedure was performed in the ED (278 minutes), the ICU (331 minutes), or the OR (378 minutes). The median (interquartile range) of HLOS for the OR group (0.87 (0.54-2.03) days) was significantly shorter than the ICU group (2.26 (1.47-6.91) days, P = 0.007). Conclusions While performing endoscopy for esophageal foreign body removal in the OR may be associated with a shorter EPL and HLOS, no location was inferior for overall outcomes. Further prospective and randomized studies are needed to confirm our findings.},

Initial and follow-up management strategies depend on multiple patient and  ingested object-related factors.

This article reviews foreign body ingestion literature with important  implications to the adolescent patient and raises awareness of some highly  dangerous objects such as large button batteries, high-powered magnets, long  sharps, narcotic packages, and super absorbent objects. An additional focus  includes the management of esophageal food impaction. We highlight the unique  aspects to the care of the adolescent with intentional ingestion and co-morbid  psychiatric illness.

Impacted foreign bodies are now much less commonly dealt with by surgical means because of the easier and less dangerous method, in the hands of experts, of extraction through the esophagoscope, while surgical procedures have been almost eliminated from the treatment for cardiospasm. In this article the last three conditions, essentially, are considered.Until within the past fifty years the esophagus received scant attention from the surgeon in spite of the well recognized pathologic conditions for which, theoretically, surgical procedures might well have been indicated. This is all the more striking when one remembers that the ancient Hindoos operated on the bladder for stone, and that Herophilus of the Alexandrian School used the knife boldly on such internal organs},

Presenting  symptoms, clinical examination, and laboratory findings can guide selection of  diagnostic imaging. RECENT FINDINGS: Intussusception and intestinal malrotation  are potentially serious causes of intestinal obstruction, which are best  evaluated by ultrasound and upper gastrointestinal series, respectively.  Ultrasound has diagnostic importance in the evaluation of multiple diseases,  including appendicitis, by potentially decreasing the need for inpatient  observation, cholecystitis and complications of gall stones such as pancreatitis,  and ovarian diseases. Pelvic inflammatory disease should be considered in  evaluation of a teenage girl with lower abdominal pain. Less common causes of  acute abdominal pain include ingested foreign bodies, infected congenital  anomalies, and perforated peptic ulcer disease. SUMMARY: Presenting symptoms and  physical examination findings can narrow the number of potential diagnoses in  pediatric acute abdominal pain and thereby guide diagnostic imaging selection.  Abdominal/pelvic ultrasound, rather than computed tomography scan, is the  preferred modality for initial evaluation of many potential causes of pediatric  abdominal pain.},

  abstract = {Background---Expert guidelines for treatment of cardiac arrest recommend administration of epinephrine every three to five minutes. However, different dosing periods of epinephrine have not been systematically assessed. Objective---We evaluated the association between epinephrine dosing frequency and survival to hospital discharge in adults with an in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Methods---Using data from 2000--2009 in the Get With the Guidelines(GWTG)-Resuscitation IHCA registry (formerly the National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation [NRCPR]), we examined the association between epinephrine dosing period and survival to hospital discharge. Epinephrine dosing period was defined as the time between the first epinephrine dose and the resuscitation endpoint, divided by the total number of epinephrine doses received subsequent to the first epinephrine dose. Generalized estimating equations were used to construct multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for patient and arrest characteristics. Results---Included were 20,909 eligible IHCA events from 505 GWTG-Resuscitation participating hospitals. Compared to an epinephrine dosing period of 4 to {$<$}5 minutes per dose, survival to hospital discharge was significantly higher in patients with an epinephrine dosing period of 6 to {$<$}10 minutes per dose: for 6 to {$<$}7 min/dose, adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.41 (95\% CI: 1.12, 1.78); for 7 to {$<$}8 min/dose, adjusted OR, 1.30 (95\%CI: 1.02, 1.65); for 8 to {$<$}9 min/dose, adjusted OR, 1.79 (95\%CI: 1.38, 2.32); for 9 to {$<$}10 min/dose, adjusted OR, 2.17 (95\%CI: 1.62, 2.92). This pattern was consistent for both shockable and non-shockable cardiac arrest rhythms. Moreover, for the majority (87\%) of cardiac arrests due to non-shockable rhythms, an epinephrine dosing period of 1 to {$<$}3 minutes/dose was associated with lower rates of survival. Conclusion---In this large, observational, national registry of in-hospital cardiac arrest, we found that epinephrine dosing at a less frequent dosing period than recommended by consensus guidelines was associated with improved survival of in-hospital cardiac arrest. Our findings suggest that clinical trials may be needed to determine the role and dose frequency of epinephrine in the treatment of in-hospital cardiac arres},

However, this subject is poorly  investigated in epidemiological studies. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was  to assess the association between TMD and SCO. MATERIAL AND METHODS:  Seventy-eight individuals with TMD and 93 control individuals without TMD were  enrolled in a case-control study and paired according to age and gender.  Panoramic radiographs were made of all participants, and SCO was measured in  millimeters (mm) by a blinded researcher. Ossification was held to begin at  measurements of 30 mm or more. The association between symptoms (pain upon  swallowing or turning the head and the sensation of a foreign body in the throat)  and SCO was investigated. Pearson chi-square tests were used for the comparison  of proportions, ({$\alpha$}=.05). RESULTS: A total of 44.9\% of those with TMD and 46.2\% of  the control population exhibited SCO (P=.858). TMD was associated with pain upon  swallowing (P{$<$}.05) and upon turning the head P{$<$}.01), but there were no  associations between the symptoms possibly related to SCO and the presence of  ossification (pain upon swallowing P=.658; sensation of a foreign body in the  throat P=.980; pain upon turning the head P=.405). CONCLUSIONS: The results  suggest that there are no associations between TMD and SCO. Some symptoms  classically associated with SCO also occur in TMD patients.},

CASE REPORT A 18-year-old man was admitted with a 3-day history of a swallowed wooden toothpick. The patient had tenderness in the left flank area. Computed tomography indicated toothpick impaction at the splenic flexura of the colon. It was successfully removed with colonoscopy. After the procedure, abdominal radiography showed free air as a sign of perforation. Along with conservative management, the patient was discharged without surgery. CONCLUSIONS There is need for greater awareness of the hazardous of an ingested toothpick. Endoscopic approach should be considered in the first-line management of toothpick perforations.},

This study aims to describe characteristics of patients presenting with  suffocation injuries to emergency departments (EDs) in the United States (U.S.)  and to identify factors associated with mortality in this population. METHODS: We  conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study using the 2013 U.S National  Emergency Department Sample database. ED visits with primary diagnoses of  intentional or accidental suffocation injury, and injury by inhalation and  aspiration of foreign bodies or food (ICD-9-CM codes) were included. We performed  descriptive statistics to describe the study population. This was followed by  multivariate analyses to identify factors associated with mortality. RESULTS: We  included a total of 27,381 ED visits for suffocation injuries. Most suffered from  either inhalation and ingestion of food causing obstruction of respiratory tract  or suffocation (51.6\%), or suicide and self-inflicted injury by hanging,  strangulation, and suffocation (39.4\%). Overall mortality was 10.9\%. Over half  (54.7\%) of the patients were between 19 and 65 years old. Males were more common  than females (59.1\% vs. 40.9\%). Over half of the patients (54.9\%) were treated  and released from the ED. Factors associated with increased mortality included  male gender, young age (4-18 years), diseases of the cardiac, respiratory,  genitourinary and neurologic systems, intentional self-harm, and self-payer  status. CONCLUSION: Mortality from suffocation injuries remains high with  significant burden on children and adolescents and on patients with intentional  injuries. Tailored initiatives targeting identified modifiable factors through  implementation of behavioral and environmental change can reduce the risk of  suffocation injury and improve clinical outcomes of affected victims.},

Imaging can facilitate the selection of  appropriate treatment options and assist in differential diagnosis. Esophageal  obstruction in cattle is generally caused by greedy nature of chewing and  swallowing of food and foreign structures, including stones, potatoes,  trichobezoar, carrots, foodstuffs (i.e., hay), and rice chaff. Esophageal  obstruction in cattle can also be caused by artificial procedures, and early  detection and treatment are important to avoid severe esophageal injury and its  associated risks. Herein, an 11-month-old Japanese black heifer presented with  swelling and induration of the neck and snowball crepitation in the subcutaneous  area of the left shoulder. Radiography and endoscopy revealed a spring-like  foreign body in the esophagus and a cervical esophageal obstruction. Esophageal  surgery confirmed that the foreign body was a ruminal mechanical stimulating  brush (RB). The case died on day 8 after the initial examination. Pathological  necropsy revealed that the RB had entered the esophageal diverticulum and caused  esophageal obstruction. This case provides a valuable reminder about the risk of  esophageal disease with oral administration procedures.},

In this review, we describe the rationale for the use of US during CVC placement, the basic principles of this technique, and the current evidence and existing guidelines for its use. In addition, we recommend a structured approach for US-guided central venous access for clinical practice. Static and real-time US can be used to visualize the anatomy and patency of the target vein in a short-axis and a long-axis view. US-guided needle advancement can be performed in an "out-of-plane" and an "in-plane" technique. There is clear evidence that US offers gains in safety and quality during CVC placement in the internal jugular vein. For the subclavian and femoral veins, US offers small gains in safety and quality. Based on the available evidence from clinical studies, several guidelines from medical societies strongly recommend the use of US for CVC placement in the internal jugular vein. Data from survey studies show that there is still a gap between the existing evidence and guidelines and the use of US in clinical practice. For clinical practice, we recommend a six-step systematic approach for US-guided central venous access that includes assessing the target vein (anatomy and vessel localization, vessel patency), using real-time US guidance for puncture of the vein, and confirming the correct needle, wire, and catheter position in the vein. To achieve the best skill level for CVC placement the knowledge from anatomic landmark techniques and the knowledge from US-guided CVC placement need to be combined and integrated.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the management and outcomes of primary button battery ingestions and their sequelae at a single high-volume  center, and to propose a risk score to predict the likelihood of a severe  outcome. METHODS: The medical record was queried for all patients under 21 years  old evaluated at our institution for button battery ingestion from 2008 to 2021.  A severe outcome was defined as having at least one of the following:  deep/circumferential mucosal erosion, perforation, mediastinitis, vascular or  airway injury/fistula, or development of esophageal stricture. From a selection  of clinically relevant factors, logistic regression determined predictors of a  severe outcome, which were incorporated into a risk model. RESULTS: 143 patients  evaluated for button battery ingestion were analyzed. 24 (17\%) had a severe  outcome. The independent predictors of a severe outcome in multivariate analysis  were location of battery in the esophagus on imaging (96\%), battery size  {$>$}/~=~2~cm (95\%), and presence of any symptoms on presentation (96\%), with  P~{$<~$}0.001 in all cases. Predicted probability of a severe outcome ranged from 88\%  when all three risk factors were observed, to 0.3\% when none were present.  CONCLUSION: We report the presentation, management, and complication profiles of  a large cohort of BB ingestions treated at a single institution. A risk score to  predict severe outcomes may be used by providers initially evaluating patients  with button battery ingestion in order to allocate resources and expedite  transfer to a center with pediatric endoscopic and surgical capabilities.

The purpose of this study was to  evaluate the ability of WBI, with and without metoclopramide pretreatment, to  clear the GI tract of foreign bodies using previously established WBI end points,  ie, the presence of a clear effluent or the administration of 2 L/h PEG-ELS for 5  hours. Eleven healthy, adult, male volunteers participated in this controlled,  two-phase, blinded, crossover study. Ten fluorescent coffee beans were ingested  after an overnight fast followed 1 hour later by 10 mg of metoclopramide syrup or  an equivalent volume of placebo; 30 minutes later, WBI with PEG-ELS was begun at  2 L/h. All volunteers received 10 L of PEG-ELS during a 5-hour period. No  statistically significant difference (P {$>$} .05) was found between the two  pretreatments. For the metoclopramide group, the mean number of beans passed was  equal to 3.8 (+/- 2.5 standard deviation [SD]; 1 to 8 R); the mean number at  clear effluent was equal to 2.3. For the placebo group, the mean number of beans  passed was equal to 3.5 (+/- 1.9 SD; 2 to 7 R), and the mean number at clear  effluent was equal to 2.3. In conclusion, the presence of a clear effluent or the  administration of 10 L of PEG-ELS are not valid markers for the termination of  WBI if complete elimination of a foreign body is required. Pretreatment with 10  mg of oral metoclopramide does not enhance the efficiency of WBI.},

There are 157 published accounts of wounding of the heart and/or great vessels by pins and needles. The victims have ranged from infants to the elderly. Causative agencies were accidents, suicide, and homicide. A few were discovered at necropsy in presumably asymptomatic persons. Six of the accidental injuries were iatrogenic. The objects reached the heart or great vessels from transthoracic insertion, ingestion, embolization, aspiration, or transabdominal penetration. The overall mortality incidence was about 50\%. Acute cardiac tamponade was the dominant cause of death. Almost all individuals survived who were operated upon and from whom the object was removed. The right ventricle was hurt most often, but no region of the heart or of the great vessels was spared. Occasionally multiple parts were affected. The primary damage occurred principally while the foreign body was extracardiac and relatively immobilized, from repetitive scratching or puncturing of the beating heart. Chest pain and unfolding patterns of tamponade were inconsistent in onset, severity, and duration. Death ensuing days or weeks after the initial injury was frequent. Progressive haemopericardium in some cases was due to or aggravated by laceration of a structure from within outward. Late complications---several fatal---were consequent upon inflammation, sepsis or thromboembolism. It is urged that all foreign bodies in the heart or great vessels be retrieved, even if seemingly innocuous clinically.},

It is unclear if one test alone is sufficient, if both are required, or if the two investigations are complementary. Study objectives were to define the combined diagnostic yield of EFASTand CXR among stable blunt thoracic trauma patients and to determine if a normal EFAST and CXR might obviate the need for computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest. METHODS: All blunt trauma patients 15 years or older presenting to LAC+USC Medical Center in 2016 were screened. Only patients who underwent CT thorax were included. Patients were excluded if they presented more than 24 hours after injury, were transferred, or if they did not undergo EFAST and CXR. Demographics, physical examination (PEx) of the thorax, injury data, investigations, procedures, and outcomes were collected. The EFAST, CXR, and PEx findings were compared to the gold standard CT thorax to calculate the diagnostic yield of each investigation and combinations thereof in the assessment for clinically significant thoracic injury. RESULTS: One thousand three hundred eleven patients met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Most common mechanisms of injury were motor vehicle collision (n = 385, 29\%) and auto versus pedestrian trauma (n = 379, 29\%). Mean Injury Severity Score was 11 (1--75), with mean Abbreviated Injury Scale chest score of 1.6 (1--6). The sensitivities of EFAST, CXR, and PEx, either individually or in combination, were less than 0.73 in the detection of clinically significant thoracic injury. The most common missed clinically significant injuries were sternal fractures, scapular fractures, clavicular fractures, and pneumothoraces. Motorcycle collisions and auto versus pedestrian traumas resulted in the highest rates of missed injury. CONCLUSION:},

We hypothesized that using a lower target for partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) would result in lower mortality than using a higher target. METHODS In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 2928 adult patients who had recently been admitted to the ICU ({$\leq$}12 hours before randomization) and who were receiving at least 10 liters of oxygen per minute in an open system or had a fraction of inspired oxygen of at least 0.50 in a closed system to receive oxygen therapy targeting a Pao2 of either 60 mm Hg (lower-oxygenation group) or 90 mm Hg (higheroxygenation group) for a maximum of 90 days.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Emergency departments are facing nowadays an increasing number of illegal drug-related health problems, associated with medicolegal and/or social  consequences. Body stuffers are street cocaine dealers, who either store wrapped  packets of drugs in their rectum or hastily swallow them, prompted by fear of  police's arrest. These packets can be life threatening in case of leakage. We  evaluate the diagnostic value of unenhanced multidetector CT (MDCT) for detection  of cocaine-filled packets (CFP) ingested by body stuffers in a phantom model.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our phantom simulated normal bowel contents in which a  varying number of true and false CFP were randomly mixed. Both only differ in  radiological density. During 18 different reading sessions, four radiologists  independently evaluated the presence and number of true and false CFP.  Interobserver agreement, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative  predictive value were calculated. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement for detection  of any packets, for visualization of true, and false CFP was good (kappa=0.63,  0.74 and 0.58, respectively). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative  predictive value for detection of any packets was 95.6\%, 100\%, 100\% and 62.5\%,  respectively; for visualization of the true CFP 86.5\%, 100\%, 100\% and 77.6\%,  respectively; and for the false packets 98.1\%, 65\%, 88.6\% and 87.5\%,  respectively. CONCLUSION: Unenhanced MDCT without bowel preparation is a fast,  reliable and easily reproducible imaging modality for the immediate detection of  ingested CFP, thus facilitating medicolegal management of body stuffers.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Foreign bodies in the oesophagus represent a frequent emergency situation in ENT medicine. Usually the cases involve lumps of meat, bones, shards  of glass, bottle tops, batteries or dentures. We would like to report about an  unusual foreign body found in the oesophagus. PATIENT: A 45-year-old patient  presented himself in our interdisciplinary casualty department where he claimed  to have swallowed a butter-knife that morning as a bet. The ENT examination  showed no abnormal findings. The thorax X-Ray revealed a 14 cm-long foreign body  in projection to the oesophagus, which matched the knife. Following consultation  with the thorax surgeon, a rigid oesophagoscopy was conducted under endotracheal  intubation and the knife was easily removed using tongs. Archive searches  conducted in the meantime showed that foreign bodies had been removed from the  patient on numerous occasions by fellow surgeons either laparoscopically or via  open surgery. As a result, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric ward  with unimpeded swallowing reflex with a suspected self-harming syndrome.  DISCUSSION: As an ENT emergency, a foreign body in the oesophagus generally  requires intervention because of the risk of complications such as perforation or  pressure-induced necrosis of the oesophagus wall with resulting mediastinitis.  Suitable instruments are the flexible oesophagoscope, the rigid oesophagoscope  under anaesthesia or transcervical/transthoracic removal. The choice of procedure  crucially depends on the type and localisation of the foreign body in the  oesophagus. Particularly in cases of unusual foreign objects or repeated foreign  object ingestion, it should be considered whether a psychological illness could  be the cause and whether the introduction of appropriate therapy could be  expedient.},

METHODS In this multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, we randomly assigned patients who presented with acute coronary syndromes and for whom invasive evaluation was planned to receive either ticagrelor or prasugrel. The primary end point was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 1 year. A major secondary end point (the safety end point) was bleeding. RESULTS A total of 4018 patients underwent randomization. A primary end-point event occurred in 184 of 2012 patients (9.3\%) in the ticagrelor group and in 137 of 2006 patients (6.9\%) in the prasugrel group (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.09 to 1.70; P\,=\,0.006). The respective incidences of the individual components of the primary end point in the ticagrelor group and the prasugrel group were as follows: death, 4.5\% and 3.7\%; myocardial infarction, 4.8\% and 3.0\%; and stroke, 1.1\% and 1.0\%. Definite or probable stent thrombosis occurred in 1.3\% of patients assigned to ticagrelor and 1.0\% of patients assigned to prasugrel, and definite stent thrombosis occurred in 1.1\% and 0.6\%, respectively. Major bleeding (as defined by the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium scale) was observed in 5.4\% of patients in the ticagrelor group and in 4.8\% of patients in the prasugrel group (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95\% CI, 0.83 to 1.51; P\,=\,0.46). CONCLUSIONS Among patients who presented with acute coronary syndromes with or without ST-segment elevation, the incidence of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke was significantly lower among those who received prasugrel than among those who received ticagrelor, and the incidence of major bleeding was not significantly different between the two groups.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Within the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework, we performed a systematic review and developed evidence-based recommendations to answer the following PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes) question: should patients who present pulseless after critical injuries (with and without signs of life after penetrating thoracic, extrathoracic, or blunt injuries) undergo emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) (vs. resuscitation without EDT) to improve survival and neurologically intact survival? METHODS: All patients who underwent EDTwere included while those involving either prehospital resuscitative thoracotomy or operating room thoracotomy were excluded. Quantitative synthesis via meta-analysis was not possible because no comparison or control group (i.e., survival or neurologically intact survival data for similar patients who did not undergo EDT) was available for the PICO questions of interest. RESULTS: The 72 included studies provided 10,238 patients who underwent EDT. Patients presenting pulseless after penetrating thoracic injury had the most favorable EDT outcomes both with (survival, 182 [21.3\%] of 853; neurologically intact survival, 53 [11.7\%] of 454) and without (survival, 76 [8.3\%] of 920; neurologically intact survival, 25 [3.9\%] of 641) signs of life. In patients presenting pulseless after penetrating extrathoracic injury, EDT outcomes were more favorable with signs of life (survival, 25 [15.6\%] of 160; neurologically intact survival, 14 [16.5\%] of 85) than without (survival, 4 [2.9\%] of 139; neurologically intact survival, 3 [5.0\%] of 60). Outcomes after EDT in pulseless blunt injury patients were limited with signs of life (survival, 21 [4.6\%] of 454; neurologically intact survival, 7 [2.4\%] of 298) and dismal without signs of life (survival, 7 [0.7\%] of 995; neurologically intact survival, 1 [0.1\%] of 825).

METHODS We conducted a single-center, pragmatic, multiple-crossover trial comparing balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A) with saline among adults who were treated with intravenous crystalloids in the emergency department and were subsequently hospitalized outside an ICU. The type of crystalloid that was administered in the emergency department was assigned to each patient on the basis of calendar month, with the entire emergency department crossing over between balanced crystalloids and saline monthly during the 16-month trial. The primary outcome was hospital-free days (days alive after discharge before day 28). Secondary outcomes included major adverse kidney events within 30 days --- a composite of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (defined as an elevation of the creatinine level to {$\geq$}200\% of baseline) --- all censored at hospital discharge or 30 days, whichever occurred first. RESULTS A total of 13,347 patients were enrolled, with a median crystalloid volume administered in the emergency department of 1079 ml and 88.3\% of the patients exclusively receiving the assigned crystalloid. The number of hospital-free days did not differ between the balanced-crystalloids and saline groups (median, 25 days in each group; adjusted odds ratio with balanced crystalloids, 0.98; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.04; P = 0.41). Balanced crystalloids resulted in a lower incidence of major adverse kidney events within 30 days than saline (4.7\% vs. 5.6\%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.70 to 0.95; P = 0.01).

Methods: This was a cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial among 974 adults admitted to a tertiary medical intensive care unit from February 3, 2015 to May 31, 2015. The intravenous crystalloid used in the unit alternated monthly between saline (0.9\% sodium chloride) and balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A). Enrollment, fluid delivery, and data collection were performed using software tools within the electronic health record. The primary outcome was the difference between study groups in the proportion of isotonic crystalloid administered that was saline. The secondary outcome was major adverse kidney events within 30 days (MAKE30), a composite of death, dialysis, or persistent renal dysfunction. Measurements and Main Results: Patients assigned to saline (n = 454) and balanced crystalloids (n = 520) were similar at baseline and received similar volumes of crystalloid by 30 days (median [interquartile range]: 1,424 ml [500-3,377] vs. 1,617 ml [500-3,628]; P = 0.40). Saline made up a larger proportion of the isotonic crystalloid given in the saline group than in the balanced crystalloid group (91\% vs. 21\%; P {$<$} 0.001). MAKE30 did not differ between groups (24.7\% vs. 24.6\%; P =0.98). Conclusions: An electronic health record-embedded, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial comparing saline with balanced crystalloids can produce well-balanced study groups and separation in crystalloid receipt.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Both balanced crystalloids and saline are used for intravenous fluid administration in critically ill adults, but it is not known which results in better clinical outcomes. METHODS In a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial conducted in five intensive care units at an academic center, we assigned 15,802 adults to receive saline (0.9\% sodium chloride) or balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A) according to the randomization of the unit to which they were admitted. The primary outcome was a major adverse kidney event within 30 days --- a composite of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (defined as an elevation of the creatinine level to {$\geq$}200\% of baseline) --- all censored at hospital discharge or 30 days, whichever occurred first. RESULTS Among the 7942 patients in the balanced-crystalloids group, 1139 (14.3\%) had a major adverse kidney event, as compared with 1211 of 7860 patients (15.4\%) in the saline group (marginal odds ratio, 0.91; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 0.99; conditional odds ratio, 0.90; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 0.99; P = 0.04). In-hospital mortality at 30 days was 10.3\% in the balanced-crystalloids group and 11.1\% in the saline group (P = 0.06). The incidence of new renal-replacement therapy was 2.5\% and 2.9\%, respectively (P = 0.08), and the incidence of persistent renal dysfunction was 6.4\% and 6.6\%, respectively (P = 0.60).

The purpose of this study was to present cases of  patients with esophageal button battery ingestion treated at our clinic and to  emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Records of  patients admitted to our hospital for foreign body ingestion between January 2010  and May 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Cases with button battery lodged in  the esophagus were included in the study. Patient data regarding age, sex, length  of time after ingestion until admission, presenting clinical symptoms, type and  localization of the battery, management, and prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS:  Among 1891 foreign body ingestions, 71 were localized in the esophagus, and 8 of  those (11.2\%) were cases of button battery ingestion. Mean age was 1.7 years.  Admission was within 6 hours of ingestion in 5 cases, after 24 hours had elapsed  in 2, and 1 month after ingestion in 1 case. All patients but 1 knew the history  of ingestion. Prompt endoscopic removal was performed for all patients. Three  patients developed esophageal stricture, which responded to dilatation.  CONCLUSION: Early recognition and timely endoscopic removal is mandatory in  esophageal button battery ingestion. It should be suspected in the differential  diagnosis of patients with persistent respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although foreign body ingestion is relatively common, toothbrush swallowing is rare. A diagnosis of small-bowel perforation, caused by a sharp or pointed foreign body, is rarely made preoperatively because the clinical symptoms are usually nonspecific and can mimic other surgical conditions, such as appendicitis and diverticulitis. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of a swallowed toothbrush which passed past the pylorus and perforated the terminal ileum. The patient however presented with a fluctuant mass in the left iliac fossa, pyrexia and generalised tenderness mimicking a diverticular abscess. DISCUSSION: Ingestion of a foreign body is commonly encountered in the clinic among children, adults with intellectual impairment, psychiatric illness or alcoholism, and dental prosthetic-wearing elderly subjects. However, toothbrush swallowing is rare, with only approximately 40 reported cases. CONCLUSION: Bowel perforation by foreign bodies can mimic acute appendicitis and should be considered in differential diagnoses. Clinically, patients often do not recall ingesting the foreign body, which makes the clinical diagnosis more challenging, and a correct diagnosis is frequently delayed. Several radiological investigations, such as small-bowel series, ultrasonography, and computed tomography scans, may lead to the correct diagnosis, but in most patients, the diagnosis is not confirmed until the surgical intervention has been performed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine the association of prehospital transfusion and time to initial transfusion with injury survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of US military combat casualties in Afghanistan between April 1, 2012, and August 7, 2015. Eligible patients were rescued alive by MEDEVAC from point of injury with either (1) a traumatic limb amputation at or above the knee or elbow or (2) shock defined as a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or a heart rate greater than 120 beats per minute. EXPOSURES Initiation of prehospital transfusion and time from MEDEVAC rescue to first transfusion, regardless of location (ie, prior to or during hospitalization). Transfusion recipients were compared with nonrecipients (unexposed) for whom transfusion was delayed or not given. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mortality at 24 hours and 30 days after MEDEVAC rescue were coprimary outcomes. To balance injury severity, nonrecipients of prehospital transfusion were frequency matched to recipients by mechanism of injury, prehospital shock, severity of limb amputation, head injury, and torso hemorrhage. Cox regression was stratified by matched groups and also adjusted for age, injury year, transport team, tourniquet use, and time to MEDEVAC rescue. RESULTS Of 502 patients (median age, 25 years [interquartile range, 22 to 29 years]; 98\% male), 3 of 55 prehospital transfusion recipients (5\%) and 85 of 447 nonrecipients (19\%) died within 24 hours of MEDEVAC rescue (between-group difference, -14\% [95\% CI, -21\% to -6\%]; P = .01). By day 30, 6 recipients (11\%) and 102 nonrecipients (23\%) died (between-group difference, -12\% [95\% CI, -21\% to -2\%]; P = .04). For the 386 patients without missing covariate data among the 400 patients within the matched groups, the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality associated with prehospital transfusion was 0.26 (95\% CI, 0.08 to 0.84, P = .02) over 24 hours (3 deaths among 54 recipients vs 67 deaths among 332 matched nonrecipients) and 0.39 (95\% CI, 0.16 to 0.92, P = .03) over 30 days (6 vs 76 deaths, respectively). Time to initial transfusion, regardless of location (prehospital or during hospitalization), was associated with reduced 24-hour mortality only up to 15 minutes after MEDEVAC rescue (median, 36 minutes after injury; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.17 [95\% CI, 0.04 to 0.73], P = .02; there were 2 deaths among 62 recipients vs 68 deaths among 324 delayed transfusion recipients or nonrecipients). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among medically evacuated US military combat causalities in Afghanistan, blood product transfusion prehospital or within minutes of injury was associated with greater 24-hour and 30-day survival than delayed transfusion or no transfusion. The findings support prehospital transfusion in this setting.},

  abstract = {Introduction: In factitious disorder (Munchausen syndrome), patients induce or aggravate symptoms of physical or psychological illness to receive attention and medical treatment. The motivation of these patients is merely getting a sick role and medical care, and entering the medical system; most of these patients have simultaneous mood disorders (especially depression), or personality disorders. Patients with factitious disorder have no secondary gain. Case Presentation: Herein, we present a middle-aged Azerbaijani man from Sarab city, East Azerbaijan who referred to hospital with complaints of abdominal and leg pain. Based on examinations, he had undergone repeated surgical procedures (laparotomy and surgical removal of the external object from the leg) due to the presence of a foreign body (needle and nail) in the intestines and leg's calf. The interview was done based on DSM-5 by a psychiatrist and after a two-month follow-up, the diagnosis was affirmed by a second opinion through a ground round session at the department of psychiatry, Tabriz university of medical sciences, Tabriz, Iran. He is under treatment with an SSRI along with cognitive psychotherapy. Conclusions: Patients with atypical and unusual manifestations of an illness associated with frequent hospital admissions and receiving multiple therapies can lead us to the diagnosis of a factitious disorder. Although patients often deny their disease and evade treatment, he was ultimately diagnosed with factitious disorder and received psychiatric treatment. The treatment goal is to reduce mortality and morbidity and to treat the underlying psychiatric disorder.},

  abstract = {Background: Ambulance service blood transfusion is an area of rapid development. In New South Wales, Australia, the blood products carried by ambulance medical teams are often the first available to patients with critical bleeding. In addition to the blood products routinely carried by these teams, the Service created and implemented a method of initiating large-volume, mixed-product transfusions using existing blood banks: the Retrieval Transfusion Procedure (RTP). This article describes the trends and characteristics of New South Wales Ambulance RTP activations. Materials and Methods: This retrospective database review examines the patient records for all RTP activations. Key areas of investigation include logistics, product requests, population demographics, etiologies, physiology, mission timings, and transfusions. Results: Ambulance medical teams attended 27 531 missions in the reviewed period, 1573 patients received transfusion, and there were 138 RTP activations. Blood products were sourced from 40 banks and transported by police (46.7\%), ambulance (27.1\%), and helicopter (13.0\%) to refueling stops (39.2\%), prehospital scenes (24.2\%) and hospitals (15.8\%). The median time engaged on each mission was 189 minutes for metropolitan and 222 minutes for rural locations. Seventy-eight patients were transfused with RTP blood products; 83.3\% were traumas, of which 63.1\% were motor vehicle collisions. Up to 18 units of blood products were administered before hospital arrival. There was significant (P {$<$} .001) improvement in the mean shock index of transfused patients between the first and final observations recorded. Conclusions: Ambulance service extended blood product transfusion is logistically achievable and facilitates emergency transfusions throughout the state with minimal additional infrastructure.},

Several techniques are available for retrieving fish hooks, ranging from simple non-invasive techniques to more complicated and invasive surgical procedures. The purpose of this case report is to document the successful surgical retrieval of an oesophageal foreign body (fish hook) using a minimally invasive oesophagotomy technique (MIOT) in an Indian Flap-shell turtle (Lissemys punctata). The adult male Indian Flap-shell turtle (Lissemys punctata) presented with a nylon thread protruding from its mouth. The dorsoventral radiographs confirmed the presence of a foreign body in the caudal oesophagus, just outside the coelomic cavity. After the induction of general anaesthesia, a sterile artificial insemination (AI) sheath was passed intraorally through the fishing line until it reached the hook. The fish hook was then retrieved by making a 5 mm incision at the point where the tip of the AI sheath was felt. The incision in the oesophagus and skin was closed in a routine manner. The turtle was kept in secure captivity for 20 days, following which it was released to its natural habitat. The oesophagotomy technique used in this case reduces the size of the incision considerably, thereby decreasing the possibility of postoperative complications.},

The purpose of our study was to determine the optimal protocol  for radiographic survey post-coin ingestion. We hypothesized that for children  presenting with a clear history of coin ingestion a frontal chest radiograph  including the entire esophagus is adequate to guide treatment. METHODS: We  reviewed the clinical history and radiographic surveys of 134 patients presenting  with suspected or witnessed coin ingestion to the emergency department of a  tertiary care pediatric hospital between January 2012 and June 2016. Patient  demographics, presenting symptoms, anatomic coverage of survey, type, number and  location of radiopaque foreign bodies, intervention, and follow-up were recorded.  RESULTS: Coins were identified on radiographic surveys in 109 of 134 patients; 25  of 134 patients had no coin. Of those with coins, none of 109 had coin(s) in the  airway, 42 of 109 had coin(s) in the esophagus, and 67 of 109 had coin(s) distal  to the esophagus. Of those with esophageal coins, 35 of 42 reported symptoms, 7  of 42 were asymptomatic, 40 of 42 underwent endoscopic coin removal, and 2 of 42  had no intervention. Of 92 of 134 surveyed patients with no coin or coin distal  to the esophagus, 30 of 92 reported symptoms, 62 of 92 were asymptomatic, 90 of  92 had no further intervention, and 2 of 92 eventually underwent endoscopic coin  removal for specific indications (abdominal pain, delayed passage). When there  was no coin found in the esophagus, the negative predictive value for  intervention was 97.8\%. CONCLUSIONS: Following a clear history of coin ingestion,  a frontal chest radiograph including the entire length of the esophagus provides  sufficient information to direct patient management.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and characteristics of pediatric cervical spine injury (PCSI) utilizing the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID). Summary of Background Data. PCSI is debilitating, but comprehensive analyses have been difficult due to its rarity. There have been a few database studies on PCSI; however, the studies employed databases that suffer from selection bias. Methods. The triennial KID was queried from years 2000 to 2012 using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Pediatric admissions were divided into five age groups reflecting different developmental stages. PCSI was analyzed in terms of trend, demographics, injury characteristics, hospital characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes variables. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent risk factors for PCSI among trauma admissions and to identify independent risk factors for mortality among PCSI admissions. Results. Over the past decade, the overall prevalence of traumatic PCSI was 2.07\%, and the mortality rate was 4.87\%. Most frequent cause of PCSI was transportation accidents, accounting for 57.51\%. Upper cervical spine injury (C1-C4), cervical fracture with spinal cord injury, spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA), and dislocation showed a decreasing trend with age. Some comorbidities, including, but not limited to, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and paralysis were common across all age groups, while substance abuse showed a bimodal distribution. Independent risk factors for PCSI after trauma were older cohorts, non-Northeast region, and transportation accidents. For mortality after PCSI, independent risk factors were younger cohorts, transportation accidents, upper cervical spine injury, dislocation, and spinal cord injuries. Median length of stay and cost were 3.84 days and \$14742. Conclusion. Pediatric patients are highly heterogeneous, constantly undergoing behavioral, environmental, and anatomical changes. PCSI after trauma is more common among older cohorts; however, mortality after sustaining PCSI is higher among younger patients.},

Prison staff potentially have a crucial role in the identification and management of female prisoners at risk; despite this there has been little focus on the attitudes of prison staff towards female prisoners who self-harm. This paper presents such an explanation; qualitative methods were used, with semi-structured interviews with eight prison officers and five healthcare staff from one female prison in the North of England. Interviews were tape recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed iteratively, until category saturation was achieved. The data suggests that prison staff labelled self-harm as either `genuine' or `non-genuine.' Women whose self-harm was perceived as non-genuine by staff were viewed as `rational manipulators,' self-harming to achieve particular ends. Staff described feelings of resentment towards these women. Most staff reported that balancing their welfare and security functions was difficult, feeling most confident with their custody role. They described feeling untrained and unsupported in their welfare role, and pressurised due to time constraints and reported low staffing levels. This combination of factors left most staff reporting lack of confidence in dealing with women who self-harm.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Foreign body ingestion occur commonly. The majority of ingested foreign bodies will pass spontaneously. However, studies have shown that in the setting of intentional ingestion, the rate of endoscopic intervention may be much higher (63\%- 76\%) and the need for surgical intervention ranges from 12\% to 16\%. The majority of foreign body ingestions occur in the pediatric population. In adults, foreign body ingestion (i.e. non-food objects) occurs more commonly in those with psychiatric disorders, developmental delay, alcohol intoxication, and in incarcerated individuals seeking secondary gain via release to a medical facility. Methods: The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) and National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was used to determine the Emergency Department (ED) and inpatient burden of foreign body ingestion in the GI tract between 2006 and 2013. We analyzed all the patients with foreign body in the digestive system (ICD-9 code: 938), as their primary discharge diagnosis. Results: From 2006 to 2013, the number of patients presenting to the ED with foreign body ingestion in the alimentary tract increased considerably from 44,284 to 52,947. The rate of visits (per 100,000 visits) had increased from 14.8 to 16.7. The rate of admission amongst the patients presenting to the ED increased from 1\% to 1.5\%. The average length of stay (LoS) has increased from 2 to 3 days with associated significant increase in mean cost per discharge from \$4,957 to 24,314. The in-hospital mortality throughout these years remained negligible. Conclusion: Emergency department visits for foreign body ingestions have increased during the time frame analyzed. Not only the average LoS has increased, the cost associated with these hospitalizations has also increased almost five times. Increased ER presentations and hospitalizations could be due to increased incidence and prevalence of eosinophilic esophagitis, psychiatric illnesses, dietary non-compliance in patients at-risk for foreign body ingestion. We postulate that the increase in cost is likely attributed to more diagnostic and/or therapeutic interventions. More emphasis should be placed on interventions like dietary, nutrition and psychiatric counselling and closer monitoring of incarcerated individuals, to prevent further ER presentations and hospitalizations. In order to deliver more cost-conscious care, further studies to determine optimal methods to avoid these events from occuring.},

We examined the characteristics and outcomes of patients who required surgical intervention. STUDY DESIGN: Charts of all patients who underwent surgery at our institution for ingested drug packets between January 1990 and January 2005 were reviewed. Patients were identified by a pre-existing list of names collected prospectively and by admission codes. Reviewed parameters included presentation, method of diagnosis, indication for surgery, procedure, and patient outcome. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were identified, for whom charts were available for review. Main indications for surgery were drug toxicity and small bowel obstruction. Most packets were retrieved using a combination of milking and multiple enterotomies. A high rate (40\%) of postoperative wound infection was found. The incidence of wound infection correlated significantly with the number of enterotomies. CONCLUSION: Surgical intervention for body packing remains the treatment for a minority of these patients. Patients should be placed in lithotomy to facilitate the exposure of the entire gastrointestinal tract, and to allow milking of the packets and their possible retrieval through the anus. The number of enterotomies should be minimized in order to reduce the risk of wound infection. If multiple enterotomies are used, the surgeon should consider leaving the wound open for delayed closure.},

This study assesses the accessibility of intrathoracic structures provided by six different ET incisions. We hypothesize that the bilateral anterior thoracotomy ("clamshell" incision) provides the most rapid and definitive accessibility to intrathoracic structures. Methods: Six ET incision types (left anterolateral thoracotomy, right anterolateral thoracotomy, left 2nd intercostal space incision, left 3rd intercostal space incision, median sternotomy, and bilateral anterior thoracotomy) were performed multiple times on eight cadavers. The critical intrathoracic structures were assessed for rapid accessibility and control, and they were characterized as "readily accessible," "accessible," and " inaccessible" on anatomic accessibility maps. Results: Median sternotomy provided better access to intrathoracic structures than left and right anterior thoracotomies. Definitive control of the origin of the left subclavian artery was difficult with left 2nd or 3rd intercostal space incisions. Bilateral anterior thoracotomy, the clamshell incision, was easy to perform and gave superior access to all intrathoracic structures. Conclusions: In severe thoracic trauma, specific injuries are unknown, even if they can be anticipated. The best incision is therefore one that provides the most rapid and definitive access to all thoracic structures for assessment and control. While the right and left anterolateral incisions may be successfully employed by surgeons with extensive experience in ET, the clamshell incision remains the superior incision choice.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the prevalence and recognized association of pulmonary contusion and flail chest (PC-FC) as a combined, complex injury pattern with interrelated pathophysiology, the mortality and morbidity of this entity have not improved during the last three decades. The purpose of this updated EAST practice management guideline was to present evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of PC-FC. METHODS: A query was conducted of MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed and Cochrane databases for the period from January 1966 through June 30, 2011. All evidence was reviewed and graded by two members of the guideline committee. Guideline formulation was performed by committee consensus. RESULTS: Of the 215 articles identified in the search, 129 were deemed appropriate for review, grading, and inclusion in the guideline. This practice management guideline has a total of six Level 2 and eight Level 3 recommendations. CONCLUSION: Patients with PC-FC should not be excessively fluid restricted but should be resuscitated to maintain signs of adequate tissue perfusion. Obligatory mechanical ventilation in the absence of respiratory failure should be avoided. The use of optimal analgesia and aggressive chest physiotherapy should be applied to minimize the likelihood of respiratory failure. Epidural catheter is the preferred mode of analgesia delivery in severe flail chest injury. Paravertebral analgesia may be equivalent to epidural analgesia and may be appropriate in certain situations when epidural is contraindicated.},

  abstract = {Purpose of review~         We reviewed the recent advances in the initial approach to resuscitation of sepsis and septic shock patients.         Recent findings~         Sepsis and septic shock are life-threatening emergencies. Two key interventions in the first hour include timely antibiotic therapy and resuscitation. Before any laboratory results, the need for resuscitation is considered if a patient with suspected infection has low blood pressure (BP) or impaired peripheral circulation found at clinical examination. Until now, this early resuscitation in sepsis and septic shock was supported by improvements in outcome seen with goal-directed therapy. However, three recent, goal-directed therapy trials failed to replicate the originally reported mortality reductions, prompting a debate on how this early resuscitation should be performed. As resuscitation is often focussed on macrociculatory goals such as optimizing central venous pressure, the discordance between microcirculatory and macrocirculatory optimization during resuscitation is a potential argument for the lack of outcome benefit in the newer trials. Vasoactive drug dose and large volume resuscitation-associated-positive fluid balance, are independently associated with worse clinical outcomes in critically ill sepsis and septic shock patients. As lower BP targets and restricted volume resuscitation are feasible and well tolerated, should we consider a lower BP target to reduce the adverse effects of catecholamine' and excess resuscitation fluids. Evidence guiding fluids, vasopressor, and inotrope selection remains limited.         Summary~         Though the early resuscitation of sepsis and septic shock is key to improving outcomes, ideal resuscitation targets are elusive. Distinction should be drawn between microcirculatory and macrocirculatory changes, and corresponding targets. Common components of resuscitation bundles such as large volume resuscitation and high-dose vasopressors may not be universally beneficial. Microcirculatory targets, individualized resuscitation goals, and reassessment of completed trials using the updated septic shock criteria should be focus areas for future research.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The retrospective study includes patients in which urgent endoscopic investigations of the upper digestive tract were performed in a 23-year period, from 1st January 1994 to 1st January 2018. RESULTS: Altogether 13{$\mkern1mu$}196 patients were investigated: 5147 (39{$\mkern1mu\%$}) females and 8049 (61{$\mkern1mu\%$}) males, mean age 62.8 years, SD {\textpm}{$\mkern1mu$}18.5 years, range 1-106 years. In only 172 patients - 1.3{$\mkern1mu\%$} of all subjects - true foreign bodies were detected (in range from 1-8) in the esophagus or stomach. In these patients, a total of 242 endoscopic procedures were performed. In 95.9{$\mkern1mu\%$} the foreign bodies were removed endoscopically (165/172 patients); in 7 cases (4.1{$\mkern1mu\%$}) the endoscopic procedures were not successful. Among the foreign bodies removed were various metal or plastic objects: hooks, batteries, coins, keys, screws, razor blades, lighters, buttons, toys, 3 toothbrushes as well as impacted safety pins. In patients with successful endoscopic removal, no significant complications were noted. In 12~patients (12/165, 7.2{$\mkern1mu\%$}), hemorrhages from the region of the esophagogastric junction or stomach were observed; endoscopic hemostasis was performed in 10/12 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Urgent endoscopy has proved successful in removing true foreign bodies from the upper gastrointestinal tract in the analyzed period. Different factors affect the success of urgent intervention, the most important being adequate experience, skills, and patience of the endoscopic team.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Surgical wounds that become infected are often debrided because clinicians believe that removal of this necrotic or infected tissue may expedite wound healing. There are numerous methods of debridement available, but no consensus on which one is most effective for surgical wounds. Objectives To assess the effects of different methods of debridement on the rate of debridement and healing of surgical wounds. Search methods In October 2021, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. To identify additional studies, we searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies, reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology reports. There were no restrictions on language, date of publication, or study setting. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people with a surgical wound that required debridement, and reported time to complete wound debridement or time to wound healing, or both. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment using the RoB 1 tool, data extraction, and GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence. Main results In this fourth update, we identified one additional study for inclusion. The review now includes six studies, with 265 participants, aged three to 91 years. Five studies were published between 1979 and 1990 and one published in 2014. The studies were carried out in hospital settings in China, Denmark, Belgium, and the UK. Six studies provided six comparisons. Due to the heterogeneity of studies, it was not appropriate to conduct meta-analyses. Four studies evaluated the effectiveness of dextranomer beads/paste; however, each study used a different comparator (Eusol-soaked dressings, 10\% aqueous polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1\% chloramine-soaked packs, and silicone foam elastomer dressing). One study compared streptokinase/streptodornase with saline-soaked dressings, and one compared endoscopic surgical debridement with conventional 'open' surgical debridement. Five studies reported time to complete debridement (reported as time to a clean wound bed) and three reported time to complete healing. One study reported effect estimates (surgical debridement via endoscopy versus surgical debridement) for time to a clean wound bed and time to complete wound healing, and it was possible to calculate effect estimates for one other study (dextranomer paste versus silicone foam elastomer) for time to complete wound healing. For the other four studies that did not report effect estimates, it was not possible to calculate time to a clean wound bed or time to complete wound healing due to missing variance and participant exclusions. None of the included studies reported outcomes pertaining to proportion of wounds completely healed, rate of reduction in wound size, rate of infection, or quality of life. All studies had unclear or high risk of bias for at least one key domain. Dextranomer paste/beads (autolytic debridement) compared with four different comparators Four studies compared dextranomer paste or beads with Eusol-soaked gauze (20 participants), 10\% aqueous polyvinylpyrrolidone (40 participants), 0.1\% chloramine-soaked dressings (28 participants), or silicone foam elastomer (50 participants). There is very low-certainty evidence that there may be no clear difference in time to a clean wound bed between dextranomer beads and Eusol gauze. The study did not report adverse events. There is very low-certainty evidence that there may be no difference in time to a clean wound bed between dextranomer paste and 10\% aqueous polyvinylpyrrolidone gauze. There was low-certainty evidence that there may be no difference in deaths and serious adverse events. There may be a difference in time until the wounds were clinically clean and time to complete wound healing between dextranomer paste and 0.1\% chloramine favouring 0.1\% chloramine, but we are very uncertain. There is low-certainty evidence that there may be no difference in deaths and serious adverse events. There is very low-certainty evidence that there may be no difference in time to complete healing between dextranomer beads and silicone foam elastomer. The study did not report adverse events. Streptokinase/streptodornase solution (enzymatic) compared with saline-soaked dressings One study (21 participants) compared enzymatic debridement with saline-soaked dressings. There is low-certainty evidence that there may be no difference in time to a clean wound bed or secondary suture between streptokinase/streptodornase and saline-soaked dressings. There is very low-certainty evidence that there may be no difference in deaths and serious adverse events. Surgical debridement via endoscopic ('keyhole') surgery compared with surgical debridement by 'open' surgery (the wound is opened using a scalpel) One study (106 participants) reported time to complete wound healing and time to a clean wound bed. There is low-certainty evidence that there may be a reduction in time to complete wound healing and very low-certainty evidence that there may be no difference in time to a clean wound bed with surgical debridement via endoscopy compared to 'open' surgical debridement. The study did not report adverse events. Overall, the evidence was low to very low-certainty for all outcomes. Five included studies were published before 1991 and investigated treatments that are no longer available. Worldwide production of dextranomer products has been discontinued, except for dextranomer paste, which is currently only available in South Africa. Furthermore, Eusol, used in one study as the comparator to dextranomer, is rarely used due to risk of harmful effects on healthy tissue and the enzymatic agent streptokinase/streptodornase is no longer available worldwide. Authors' conclusions Evidence for the effects of different methods of debridement on complete wound debridement and healing of surgical wounds remains unclear. Adequately powered, methodologically robust RCTs evaluating contemporary debridement interventions for surgical wounds are needed to guide clinical decision-making. Plain language summary Is there a best way to remove dead tissue from surgical wounds? Key message We cannot be certain whether removal of dead or infected tissue of surgical wounds or care that is usually provided makes any difference to how long it takes to remove all of the dead tissue from the wound and for the wound to heal. What did we want to find out? Following surgery, most surgical wounds heal naturally with no complications. However, complications such as infection can occur, which may result in delayed healing. There are many different methods of removing dead or infected tissue (called debridement), such as surgical removal of the tissue, enzymes (naturally occurring proteins that dissolve the tissue), and mechanical methods (for example, a special dry gauze that is removed when the tissue has stuck to it). We wanted to look at the different ways to remove dead or infected tissue from wounds after surgical operations and find out how they affect the time it takes to remove all of the dead tissue from the wound and for the wound to heal. What did we do? We searched medical databases for well-designed studies including people of any age that compared one method of debridement versus a dummy treatment (placebo), no treatment, or another method of debridement after surgery. What did we find? We found six studies dating from 1979 to 2014 that compared different types of wound debridement with the way care was usually provided for wounds that had dead tissue within them after surgery. All six studies compared different types of debridement methods or different types of usual care, meaning we could not combine the results. The total number of participants within the studies was 265, and ages of participants ranged from three to 91 years. The studies were carried out in hospitals in China, Denmark, Belgium, and the UK. Four studies compared a treatment method that promotes the body's natural wound healing process (called autolytic) with different types of usual care. Overall, we found that this method may make little or no difference to how long it takes to remove all of the dead tissue. One study compared an enzyme with usual care, and we found that this method may make little or no difference to how long it takes to remove all of the dead tissue. One study compared different methods of removing dead tissue using surgery (one via 'keyhole' surgery, the other 'normal' surgery). We found that using keyhole surgery to remove the dead tissue may have little or no effect on time for the wound to heal, but we are very uncertain about the results. Only three of the studies (two autolytic and one using an enzyme) reported serious harmful events that led to discontinuation of treatment or hospital admission. There may be no difference in deaths and serious harmful events between the treatment methods. Overall, all the studies indicated that it is unclear whether any type of wound debridement is better than usual care at reducing time to remove all of the dead tissue, time to complete healing, serious harmful events that led to discontinuation of treatment, or hospital admission. What are the limitations of the evidence? Overall, we are very uncertain about the evidence, mainly because the studies had small numbers of people, and did not report the results well. Additionally, five studies used debridement products that are no longer used clinically. How up to date is the evidence? We searched for studies published up to October 2021.},

Background: PHBP are increasingly used for pre-hospital trauma resuscitation despite a lack of robust evidence demonstrating superiority over crystalloids. Provision of PHBP carries additional logistical and regulatory implications, and requires a sustainable supply of universal blood components. Methods: RePHILL is a multi-centre, two-arm, parallel group, open-label, phase III randomised controlled trial currently underway in the UK. Patients attended by a pre-hospital emergency medical team, with traumatic injury and hypotension (systolic blood pressure {$<$}90 mmHg or absent radial pulse) believed to be due to traumatic haemorrhage are eligible. Exclusion criteria include age {$<$}16 years, blood product receipt on scene prior to randomisation, Advanced Medical Directive forbidding blood product administration, pregnancy, isolated head injury and prisoners. A total of 490 patients will be recruited in a 1 :~1 ratio to receive either the intervention (up to two units of red blood cells and two units of lyophilised plasma) or the control (up to four boluses of 250 mL 0.9\% saline). The primary outcome measure is a composite of failure to achieve lactate clearance of {$\geq$}20\%/h over the first 2 hours after randomisation and all-cause mortality between recruitment and discharge from the primary receiving facility to non-acute care. Secondary outcomes include pre-hospital time, coagulation indices, in-hospital transfusion requirements and morbidity. Results: Pilot study recruitment began in December 2016. Approval to proceed to the main trial was received in June 2017. Recruitment is expected to continue until 2020. Conclusions: RePHILL will provide high-quality evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of PHBP resuscitation for trauma.},

METHODS: Children {$<$}18years  old who ingested a magnet were reviewed from 1/2011 to 6/2016 from two tertiary  center children's hospitals. Demographics, symptoms, management and outcomes were  analyzed. RESULTS: From 2011 to 2016, there were 89 magnet ingestions (50 from  hospital 1 and 39 from hospital 2); 50 (56\%) were males. Median age was 7.9  (4.0-12.0) years; 60 (67\%) presented with multiple magnets or a magnet and a  second metallic co-ingestion. Suspected locations found on imaging were: stomach  (53\%), small bowel (38\%), colon (23\%) and esophagus (3\%). Only 35 patients (39\%)  presented with symptoms and the most common symptom was abdominal pain (33\%). 42  (47\%) patients underwent an intervention, in which 20 (23\%) had an abdominal  operation. For those undergoing abdominal surgery, an exact logistic regression  model identified multiple magnets or a magnet and a second metallic object  co-ingestion (OR 12.9; 95\% CI, 2.4 - Infinity) and abdominal pain (OR 13.0; 95\%  CI, 3.2-67.8) as independent risk factors. CONCLUSION: Magnets have a high risk  of requiring surgical intervention for removal. Therefore, we developed a  management algorithm for magnet ingestion. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.},

The trend of drug use has changed from opium to methadone from 2006 to 2011. Presence of a large number of addicted people and methadone maintenance therapy clinics make methadone readily available in Iran. Therefore, evaluation of the epidemiological characteristic of methadone toxicity and its effects on the heart is essential. Methods: In This cross-sectional, retrospective, descriptive, analytical study all patients with methadone or opium toxicity who had been admitted to Vasei hospital, Sabzevar, Iran, during the years 2015 and 2016 were included, and their records were evaluated. Demographic data, addiction history, underlying diseases, and the outcome of admission were recorded. Then, corrected QT interval (QTc) of the first ECG of the patients after admission was evaluated. Results: The Majority of toxicities occurred in those above 30 years of age (71.4\%), who lived in cities (62.8\%), and were married (69.2\%). A positive history of addiction was considerably higher in the opium group (72.3\% versus 43.3\%). There was no significant difference regarding QTc prolongation between patients with methadone and opium toxicity (p = 0.3). Conclusion: QTc prolongation is one of the adverse effects of methadone or opium overdose. It seems that significant QTc prolongation is not uncommon among patients with opium overdose.},

Methods We evaluated the incidence, specific causes, and prognosis of syncope among women and men participating in the Framingham Heart Study from 1971 to 1998. Results Of 7814 study participants followed for an average of 17 years, 822 reported syncope. The incidence of a first report of syncope was 6.2 per 1000 person-years. The most frequently identified causes were vasovagal (21.2 percent), cardiac (9.5 percent), and orthostatic (9.4 percent); for 36.6 percent the cause was unknown. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios among participants with syncope from any cause, as compared with those who did not have syncope, were 1.31 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.14 to 1.51) for death from any cause, 1.27 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.64) for myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease, and 1.06 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.45) for fatal or nonfatal stroke. The corresponding hazard ratios among participants with cardiac syncope were 2.01 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.48 to 2.73), 2.66 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.69 to 4.19), and 2.01 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.06 to 3.80). Participants with syncope of unknown cause and those with neurologic syncope had increased risks of death from any cause, with multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of 1.32 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.60) and 1.54 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.12 to 2.12), respectively. There was no increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity or mortality associated with vasovagal (including orthostatic and medication-related) syncope. Conclusions Persons with cardiac syncope are at increased risk for death from any cause and cardiovascular events, and persons with syncope of unknown cause are at increased risk for death from any cause. Vasovagal syncope appears to have a benign prognosis. (N Engl J Med 2002;347:878-85.)},

  abstract = {Background: Severe traumatic injury continues to present challenges to healthcare systems around the world, and post-traumatic bleeding remains a leading cause of potentially preventable death among injured patients. Now in its fifth edition, this document aims to provide guidance on the management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following traumatic injury and encourages adaptation of the guiding principles described here to individual institutional circumstances and resources. Methods: The pan-European, multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma was founded in 2004, and the current author group included representatives of six relevant European professional societies. The group applied a structured, evidence-based consensus approach to address scientific queries that served as the basis for each recommendation and supporting rationale. Expert opinion and current clinical practice were also considered, particularly in areas in which randomised clinical trials have not or cannot be performed. Existing recommendations were re-examined and revised based on scientific evidence that has emerged since the previous edition and observed shifts in clinical practice. New recommendations were formulated to reflect current clinical concerns and areas in which new research data have been generated. Results: Advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of post-traumatic coagulopathy have supported improved management strategies, including evidence that early, individualised goal-directed treatment improves the outcome of severely injured patients. The overall organisation of the current guideline has been designed to reflect the clinical decision-making process along the patient pathway in an approximate temporal sequence. Recommendations are grouped behind the rationale for key decision points, which are patient- or problem-oriented rather than related to specific treatment modalities. While these recommendations provide guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of major bleeding and coagulopathy, emerging evidence supports the author group's belief that the greatest outcome improvement can be achieved through education and the establishment of and adherence to local clinical management algorithms. Conclusions: A multidisciplinary approach and adherence to evidence-based guidance are key to improving patient outcomes. If incorporated into local practice, these clinical practice guidelines have the potential to ensure a uniform standard of care across Europe and beyond and better outcomes for the severely bleeding trauma patient.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether any statistically supportable threshold between systolic pressure and mortality emerges from the data a priori, without assuming that a cut point exists. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Observational evaluation of a large prehospital database established as a part of the Excellence in Prehospital Injury Care Traumatic Brain Injury Study. Patients from the preimplementation cohort (January 2007 to March 2014) 10 years and older with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (Barell Matrix Type 1 classification, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision head region severity score of 3 or greater, and/or Abbreviated Injury Scale head-region severity score of 3 or greater) and a prehospital systolic pressure between 40 and 119 mm Hg were included. The generalized additive model and logistic regression were used to determine the association between systolic pressure and probability of death, adjusting for significant/important confounders. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS Among the 3844 included patients, 2565 (66.7\%) were male, and the median (range) age was 35 (10-99) years. The model revealed a monotonically decreasing association between systolic pressure and adjusted probability of death across the entire range (ie, from 40 to 119 mm Hg). Each 10-point increase of systolic pressure was associated with a decrease in the adjusted odds of death of 18.8\% (adjusted odds ratio, 0.812; 95\% CI, 0.748-0.883). Thus, the adjusted odds of mortality increased as much for a drop from 110 to 100 mm Hg as for a drop from 90 to 80 mm Hg, and so on throughout the range. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We found a linear association between lowest prehospital systolic blood pressure and severity-adjusted probability of mortality across an exceptionally wide range. There is no identifiable threshold or inflection point between 40 and 119 mm Hg. Thus, in patients with traumatic brain injury, the concept that 90 mm Hg represents a unique or important physiological cut point may be wrong. Furthermore, clinically meaningful hypotension may not be as low as current guidelines suggest. Randomized trials evaluating treatment levels significantly above 90 mm Hg are needed.},

This narrative review aims to explore the factors contributing to suicidality within the migrant groups, consequently highlighting the need for tailored interventions and supporting strategies. Firstly, we reviewed the evidences on the prevalence of suicidal ideation, attempted suicides, and deaths by suicide among migrants. The results were extremely heterogeneous, mostly depending on the different migrant group considered. Significant differences in suicide risk have been found depending on the legal status of migrants and their country of origin/migration. The second section explored the protective and risk factors for suicidal ideation and behaviours in different migrant groups. The analysis concluded that a set of factors may interact in various ways, contributing to a heterogeneous and complex framework underpinning the phenomenon of suicide. Migration itself may be a challenging and traumatizing experience, characterized by social isolation, cultural dislocation and adjustment, as well as economic and financial distress, all of which may exacerbate pre-existing mental health vulnerabilities or trigger new mental disorders. Acculturative stress, discrimination, and language barriers further compound these challenges, often hindering access to mental health services.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND After a person has been injured, prehospital administration of plasma in addition to the initiation of standard resuscitation procedures in the prehospital environment may reduce the risk of downstream complications from hemorrhage and shock. Data from large clinical trials are lacking to show either the efficacy or the risks associated with plasma transfusion in the prehospital setting. METHODS To determine the efficacy and safety of prehospital administration of thawed plasma in injured patients who are at risk for hemorrhagic shock, we conducted a pragmatic, multicenter, cluster-randomized, phase 3 superiority trial that compared the administration of thawed plasma with standard-care resuscitation during air medical transport. The primary outcome was mortality at 30 days. RESULTS A total of 501 patients were evaluated: 230 patients received plasma (plasma group) and 271 received standard-care resuscitation (standard-care group). Mortality at 30 days was significantly lower in the plasma group than in the standard-care group (23.2\% vs. 33.0\%; difference, -9.8 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval, -18.6 to -1.0\%; P\,=\,0.03). A similar treatment effect was observed across nine prespecified subgroups (heterogeneity chi-square test, 12.21; P\,=\,0.79). Kaplan--Meier curves showed an early separation of the two treatment groups that began 3 hours after randomization and persisted until 30 days after randomization (log-rank chi-square test, 5.70; P\,=\,0.02). The median prothrombintime ratio was lower in the plasma group than in the standard-care group (1.2 [interquartile range, 1.1 to 1.4] vs. 1.3 [interquartile range, 1.1 to 1.6], P{$<$}0.001) after the patients' arrival at the trauma center. No significant differences between the two groups were noted with respect to multiorgan failure, acute lung injury--acute respiratory distress syndrome, nosocomial infections, or allergic or transfusion-related reactions. CONCLUSIONS In injured patients at risk for hemorrhagic shock, the prehospital administration of thawed plasma was safe and resulted in lower 30-day mortality and a lower median prothrombintime ratio than standard-care resuscitation.

  abstract = {Background: Increased understanding of the pathophysiology of the acute coagulopathy of trauma has lead many to question the current transfusion approach to hemorrhagic shock. We hypothesized that warm fresh whole blood (WFWB) transfusion would be associated with improved survival in patients with trauma compared with those transfused only stored component therapy (CT). Methods: We retrospectively studied US Military combat casualty patients transfused {$>$}1 unit of red blood cells (RBCs). The following two groups of patients were compared: (1) WFWB, who were transfused WFWB, RBCs, and plasma but not apheresis platelets and (2) CT, who were transfused RBC, plasma, and apheresis platelets but not WFWB. The primary outcomes were 24-hour and 30-day survival. Results: Of 354 patients analyzed there were 100 in the WFWB and 254 in the CT group. Patients in both groups had similar severity of injury determined by admission eye, verbal, and motor Glasgow Coma Score, base deficit, international normalized ratio, hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, and injury severity score. Both 24-hour and 30-day survival were higher in the WFWB cohort compared with CT patients, 96 of 100 (96\%) versus 223 of 254 (88\%), ( p ؍ 0.018) and 95\% to 82\%, ( p ؍ 0.002), respectively. An increased amount (825 mL) of additives and anticoagulants were administered to the CT compared with the WFWB group, ( p {$<$} 0.001). Upon multivariate logistic regression the use of WFWB and the volume of WFWB transfused was independently associated with improved 30-day survival. Conclusions: In patients with trauma with hemorrhagic shock, resuscitation strategies that include WFWB may improve 30day survival, and may be a result of less anticoagulants and additives with WFWB use in this population.},

  abstract = {Recent combat experience reignited interest in transfusing whole blood (WB) for patients with life-threatening bleeding. US Army data indicate that WB transfusion is associated with improved or comparable survival compared to resuscitation with blood components. These data complement randomized controlled trials that indicate that platelet (PLT)-containing blood products stored at 4{$^\circ$}C have superior hemostatic function, based on reduced bleeding and improved functional measures of hemostasis, compared to PLT-containing blood products at 22{$^\circ$}C.             WB is rarely available in civilian hospitals and as a result is rarely transfused for patients with hemorrhagic shock. Recent developments suggest that impediments to WB availability can be overcome, specifically the misconceptions that WB must be ABO specific, that WB cannot be leukoreduced and maintain PLTs, and finally that cold storage causes loss of PLT function. Data indicate that the use of low anti-A and anti-B titer group O WB is safe as a universal donor, WB can be leukoreduced with PLT-sparing filters, and WB stored at 4{$^\circ$}C retains PLT function during 15 days of storage. The understanding that these perceived barriers are not insurmountable will improve the availability of WB and facilitate its use. In addition, there are logistic and economic advantages of WB-based resuscitation compared to component therapy for hemorrhagic shock. The use of low-titer group O WB stored for up to 15 days at 4{$^\circ$}C merits further study to compare its efficacy and safety with current resuscitation approaches for all patients with life-threatening bleeding.},

In a fraction of patients, FB ingestion can be a medical emergency with risk for fatal complications. Literature regarding success rates and complications of upper gastrointestinal FB extraction in adults is sparse. Methods: As a large tertiary care teaching hospital, we retrospectively reviewed charts of patients who presented with FB ingestion from 2011-2014. Demographics, ingestion characteristics, and outcome measurements were collected. Chi-Square test was used to investigate associations between these variables. Results: 260 patients presented with FB ingestion: 160 (61.5\%) men, mean age 60 years ({\textpm} 20.03), median age for accidental ingestion 61 years, purposeful ingestion 34 years. Ingestion was accidental in 95\%, ingested material was food bolus in 92\%, and intervention required intubation in 51\% of cases. The main symptom from FB ingestion was dysphagia (94\%). 22\% had an underlying psychiatric disorder; depression (n=43), anxiety (n=20) and bipolar disorder (n=15). Esophageal abnormalities were present in 79\% of patients at the time of endoscopy; majority was structural (92\%). Incidental findings during endoscopy included stricture (35\%), Schatzki's ring (29\%), hiatal hernia (25\%), ringed esophagus (22\%) GERD (5\%), Barret's esophagus (5\%) and malignancy (4\%). A biopsy was performed at the time of procedure for 90 patients; 40\% of this group had ringed esophagus. Compared to patients without a ringed esophagus, those that did had a higher proportion of eosinophilic esophagitis (25\% and 58\%, respectively;p=0.002). Of the 260 patients, 200 patients received intervention in ER, 46 patients as inpatient and 14 patients, as outpatient. All interventions that were done in ER were successful. Success rate of inpatient procedures was 89\%, outpatient 93\% with overall success rate 98\%. Flexible esophagogastroduodenoscopy was the mode of intervention in majority (n=252) with success rate 98\%. Frequency of location of FB with outcome is shown in figure 1. Specific complications of the procedure were bleeding 1.5\%, perforation 1.9\% aspiration pneumonia, 1.5\% and post procedure hospitalization (6.1\%). There were no reports of stricture, fistula, diverticula or abscess. Conclusions: Our study shows that flexible endoscopes have high success rates with minimal complications. During the study period, all patients presenting to our hospital underwent interventional endoscopy and it was found that the risk of complications was extremely low, proportion of successful removal was high, identified underlying abnormalities and facilitated biopsies. There was a statistically significant association between ringed esophagus and eosinophilic esophagitis, signifying the importance of biopsy at the time of endoscopy. (Figure presented).},

We present a newly developed, clinically oriented classification of the various types of shock and their therapeutic implications. Methods: This review is based on pertinent publications (1990--2018) retrieved by a selective search in PubMed, and on the relevant guidelines and meta-analyses. Results: There are only four major categories of shock, each of which is mainly related to one of four organ systems. Hypovolemic shock relates to the blood and fluids compartment while distributive shock relates to the vascular system; cardiogenic shock arises from primary cardiac dysfunction; and obstructive shock arises from a blockage of the circulation. Hypovolemic shock is due to intravascular volume loss and is treated by fluid replacement with balanced crystalloids. Distributive shock, on the other hand, is a state of relative hypovolemia resulting from pathological redistribution of the absolute intravascular volume and is treated with a combination of vasoconstrictors and fluid replacement. Cardiogenic shock is due to inadequate function of the heart, which shall be treated, depending on the situation, with drugs, surgery, or other interventional procedures. In obstructive shock, hypoperfusion due to elevated resistance shall be treated with an immediate life-saving intervention. Conclusion: The new classification is intended to facilitate the goal-driven treatment of shock in both the pre-hospital and the inpatient setting. A uniform treatment strategy should be established for each of the four types of shock.},

We conducted a search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus databases from 1990 to February 2017 using keyword and subject headings for syncope and troponin testing. Design and results of the included studies are extracted. Studies were assessed for heterogeneity and the pooled proportion of measured troponin and positive troponin result described. There were nine studies included for analysis. Significant statistical heterogeneity among studies was observed (P {$<$} 0.001). Using the random effects model, the pooled proportion of patients presenting to the ED after syncope who had troponin measured was 0.64 (95\% CI 0.46--0.82). Among patients who had been troponin tested, the pooled proportion who had a positive result was 0.19 (95\% CI 0.13--0.26). Variability among reported outcomes prevented further meta-analysis. Troponin testing was commonly performed for the assessment of patients with syncope with a substantial proportion returning positive results. The correlation between raised troponin and patient outcomes was not adequately reported. It is possible that an elevated troponin may indicate serious illness, rather than myocardial damage alone.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Recent studies have suggested that serum lactate may serve as a marker to predict mortality after resuscitation from cardiac arrest (CA). The relationship between serum lactate and CA outcomes requires further characterization, especially among patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH) and aggressive post-arrest care. Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients resuscitated from non-traumatic CA at three urban U.S. hospitals was performed using an established internet-based post-arrest registry. Adult ({$\geq$}18 years) patients resuscitated from CA and receiving TH treatment were included. Logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for potential confounders to survival outcomes. Survival to discharge served as the primary endpoint. Results: A total of 199 post-CA patients treated with TH between 5/2005 and 11/2011 were included in this analysis. The mean age was 56.9 {\textpm} 16.5 years, 85/199 (42.7\%) patients were female, and survival to discharge was attained in 84/199 (42.2\%). While lower initial post-CA serum lactate levels were not associated with increased survival to discharge, subsequent lactate measurements were significantly associated with outcomes (24-h serum lactate levels in survivors vs. non-survivors, 2.7 {\textpm} 0.5 vs. 4.2 {\textpm} 0.4 mmol/L, p {$<$} 0.01). Multivariable logistic regression confirmed this relationship with survival to discharge (p {$<$} 0.01). Conclusion: Lower serum lactate levels at 12 h and 24 h, but not initially following cardiac arrest, are associated with survival to hospital discharge after resuscitation from CA and TH treatment. Prospective investigation of serum lactate as a potential prognostic tool in CA is needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the last century, the management of blunt force trauma to the liver has changed from observation and expectant management in the early part of the 1900s to mainly operative intervention, to the current practice of selective operative and nonoperative management. These issues were first addressed by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma in the Practice Management Guidelines for Nonoperative Management of Blunt Injury to the Liver and Spleen published online in 2003. Since that time, a large volume of literature on these topics has been published requiring a reevaluation of the previous Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma guideline. METHODS: The National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health MEDLINE database were searched using PubMed (www.pubmed.gov). The search was designed to identify English-language citations published after 1996 (the last year included in the previous guideline) using the keywords liver injury and blunt abdominal trauma. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-six articles were reviewed, of which 94 were used to create the current practice management guideline for the selective nonoperative management of blunt hepatic injury. CONCLUSION: Most original hepatic guidelines remained valid and were incorporated into the greatly expanded current guidelines as appropriate. Nonoperative management of blunt hepatic injuries currently is the treatment modality of choice in hemodynamically stable patients, irrespective of the grade of injury or patient age. Nonoperative management of blunt hepatic injuries should only be considered in an environment that provides capabilities for monitoring, serial clinical evaluations, and an operating room available for urgent laparotomy. Patients presenting with hemodynamic instability and peritonitis still warrant emergent operative intervention. Intravenous contrast enhanced computed tomographic scan is the diagnostic modality of choice for evaluating blunt hepatic injuries. Repeated imaging should be guided by a patient's clinical status.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the last century, the management of blunt force trauma to the spleen has changed from observation and expectant management in the early part of the 1900s to mainly operative intervention, to the current practice of selective operative and nonoperative management. These issues were first addressed by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) in the Practice Management Guidelines for Non-operative Management of Blunt Injury to the Liver and Spleen published online in 2003. Since that time, a large volume of literature on these topics has been published requiring a reevaluation of the current EAST guideline. METHODS: The National Library of Medicine and the National Institute of Health MEDLINE database was searched using Pub Med (www.pubmed.gov). The search was designed to identify English-language citations published after 1996 (the last year included in the previous guideline) using the keywords splenic injury and blunt abdominal trauma. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-six articles were reviewed, of which 125 were used to create the current practice management guideline for the selective nonoperative management of blunt splenic injury. CONCLUSION: There has been a plethora of literature regarding nonoperative management of blunt splenic injuries published since the original EAST practice management guideline was written. Nonoperative management of blunt splenic injuries is now the treatment modality of choice in hemodynamically stable patients, irrespective of the grade of injury, patient age, or the presence of associated injuries. Its use is associated with a low overall morbidity and mortality when applied to an appropriate patient population. Nonoperative management of blunt splenic injuries should only be considered in an environment that provides capabilities for monitoring, serial clinical evaluations, and has an operating room available for urgent laparotomy. Patients presenting with hemodynamic instability and peritonitis still warrant emergent operative intervention. Intravenous contrast enhanced computed tomographic scan is the diagnostic modality of choice for evaluating blunt splenic injuries. Repeat imaging should be guided by a patient's clinical status. Adjunctive therapies like angiography with embolization are increasingly important adjuncts to nonoperative management of splenic injuries. Despite the explosion of literature on this topic, many questions regarding nonoperative management of blunt splenic injuries remain without conclusive answers in the literature.

Like other repetitive and ritualistic behaviours, pica may be postulated to fall at times on this spectrum. METHODS: Five cases of pica seen at our clinics are presented here in order to test this hypothesis. Phenomenology, neurobiology (where available) and pharmacotherapy data are provided in order to consider a possible relationship with OCD and OCD spectrum disorders. RESULTS: In 2 of the cases, pica appeared to be a compulsion and patients had additional symptoms which met diagnostic criteria for OCD. In 2 of the cases, the clinical picture and neurobiological data were reminiscent of an impulse control disorder. Four of the 5 patients responded to treatment with a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SRI). CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with a hypothesis that at least some cases of pica may usefully be conceptualised as lying within a compulsive-impulsive spectrum of symptoms and disorders.},

We examined the effect of two different c-spine evaluation protocols on c-spine immobilization and clinical outcomes. We prospectively evaluated consecutive intubated and mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of a Level I academic trauma center with a diagnosis of multiple blunt injuries who had normal findings on high-resolution helical computed tomogram of C1 to T1 with reconstructions (HCTrecon). From July 1, 2003 to June 30, 2005 (n = 140), the findings of HCTrecon and either clinical examination or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were required to be normal to discontinue c-spine immobilization (clinical/MRI protocol). From July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2006 (n = 75), the policy was changed to require normal finding only on HCTrecon to discontinue c-spine immobilization (HCTrecon protocol). Patients evaluated by the clinical/MRI and HCTrecon protocols had similar baseline characteristics. Compared with clinical/MRI patients, HCTrecon patients had their c-spines immobilized for fewer days (median, 6 days vs. 2 days; p {$<$} 0.001), were less likely to experience a complication of c-spine immobilization (64\% vs. 37\%, p = 0.010), required shorter periods of mechanical ventilation (median, 4 days vs. 3 days; p = 0.011), and had shorter stays in the ICU (median, 6 days vs. 4 days; p = 0.028) and hospital (median, 16 days vs. 14 days; p = 0.043). There was no difference in hospital mortality (13\% vs. 16\%, p = 0.920) and no missed c-spine injuries in either group. Discontinuation of c-spine precautions based on the normal findings of HCTrecon decreases the duration of c-spine immobilization in obtunded severely injured patients and is associated with fewer complications, fewer days of mechanical ventilation, and shorter stays in the ICU and hospital. {\copyright} 2007 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Inc.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To study whether compliance with methodological standards affected the reported accuracy of screening ultrasonography (US) for trauma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Meta-analysis was conducted of prospective investigations in which US was compared with any diagnostic reference test in patients with suspected abdominal injury. Reports were retrieved from electronic databases without language restrictions; added information was gained with manual search. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological rigor by using 27 items contained in the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) checklist and the Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy included in Systematic Reviews (QUADAS) instrument. Inconsistencies were resolved by means of consensus. Summary receiver operating characteristics and random-effects meta-regression were used to model the effect of methodological standards and other study features on US accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 62 trials, which included a total of 18 167 participants, were eligible for meta-analysis. The average proportion of men or boys was 71.7\%, the mean age was 30.6 years {\textpm} 10.8 (standard deviation), and the mean injury severity score was 16.7 {\textpm} 8.3. The prevalence of abdominal trauma was 25.1\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 21.1\%, 29.1\%). Pooled overall sensitivity and specificity of US were 78.9\% (95\% CI: 74.9\%, 82.9\%) and 99.2\% (95\% CI: 99.0\%, 99.4\%), respectively. Varying end points (hemoperitoneum or organ damage) did not change these results. US accuracy was much lower in children (sensitivity, 57.9\%; specificity, 94.3\%). Strong heterogeneity was observed in sensitivity, whereas specificity remained constant across trials. There was evidence of publication bias. Initial interobserver agreement with methodological standards ranged from poor ({$\kappa$} = 0.03, independent verification of US findings) to perfect ({$\kappa$} = 1.00, sufficiently short interval between US and reference test). By consensus, studies fulfilled a median of 13 methodological criteria (range, five to 20 criteria). In investigations that lacked individual methodological standards, researchers overestimated pooled sensitivity, with predicted differences of 9\%-18\%. The use of a single reference test, specification of the number of excluded patients, and calculation of CIs independently contributed to predicted sensitivity in a multivariate model. In 16 investigations (1309 subjects), a single reference test was used, which provided a combined sensitivity of 66.0\% (95\% CI: 56.2\%, 75.8\%). CONCLUSION: Bias-adjusted sensitivity of screening US for trauma is low. Adherence to methodological standards included in appraisal instruments like STARD and QUADAS is crucial to obtain valid estimates of test accuracy. {\copyright} RSNA, 2005.},

  abstract = {Objective To derive a clinical decision rule that is highly sensitive for detecting acute C-spine injury and will allow emergency department (ED) physicians to be more selective in use of radiography in alert and stable trauma patients. Design Prospective cohort study conducted from October 1996 to April 1999, in which physicians evaluated patients for 20 standardized clinical findings prior to radiography. In some cases, a second physician performed independent interobserver assessments. Setting Ten EDs in large Canadian community and university hospitals. Patients Convenience sample of 8924 adults (mean age, 37 years) who presented to the ED with blunt trauma to the head/neck, stable vital signs, and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. Main Outcome Measure Clinically important C-spine injury, evaluated by plain radiography, computed tomography, and a structured follow-up telephone interview. The clinical decision rule was derived using the ␬ coefficient, logistic regression analysis, and ␹2 recursive partitioning techniques. Results Among the study sample, 151 (1.7\%) had important C-spine injury. The resultant model and final Canadian C-Spine Rule comprises 3 main questions: (1) is there any high-risk factor present that mandates radiography (ie, age Ն65 years, dangerous mechanism, or paresthesias in extremities)? (2) is there any low-risk factor present that allows safe assessment of range of motion (ie, simple rear-end motor vehicle collision, sitting position in ED, ambulatory at any time since injury, delayed onset of neck pain, or absence of midline C-spine tenderness)? and (3) is the patient able to actively rotate neck 45{$^\circ$} to the left and right? By cross-validation, this rule had 100\% sensitivity (95\% confidence interval [CI], 98\%-100\%) and 42.5\% specificity (95\% CI, 40\%-44\%) for identifying 151 clinically important C-spine injuries. The potential radiography ordering rate would be 58.2\%. Conclusion We have derived the Canadian C-Spine Rule, a highly sensitive decision rule for use of C-spine radiography in alert and stable trauma patients. If prospectively validated in other cohorts, this rule has the potential to significantly reduce practice variation and inefficiency in ED use of C-spine radiography.},

Our objective was to determine whether increased ratios of fibrinogen to red blood cells (RBCs) decreased mortality in combat casualties requiring massive transfusion. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 252 patients at a U.S. Army combat support hospital who received a massive transfusion ({$>$}10 units of RBCs in 24 hours). The typical amount of fibrinogen within each blood product was used to calculate the fibrinogen-to-RBC (F:R) ratio transfused for each patient. Two groups of patients who received either a low ({$<$}0.2 g fibrinogen/RBC Unit) or high ({$>$}0.2 g fibrinogen/RBC Unit) F:R ratio were identified. Mortality rates and the cause of death were compared between these groups, and logistic regression was used to determine if the F:R ratio was independently associated with survival. Results: Two-hundred and fifty-two patients who received a massive transfusion with a mean (SD) ISS of 21 (؎10) and an overall mortality of 75 of 252 (30\%) were included. The mean (SD) F:R ratios transfused for the low and high groups were 0.1 grams/Unit (؎0.06), and 0.48 grams/Unit (؎0.2), respectively ( p {$<$} 0.001). Mortality was 27 of 52 (52\%) and 48 of 200 (24\%) in the low and high F:R ratio groups respectively ( p {$<$} 0.001). Additional variables associated with survival were admission temperature, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin, International Normalized Ratio (INR), base deficit, platelet concentration and Combined Injury Severity Score (ISS). Upon logistic regression, the F:R ratio was independently associated with mortality (odds ratio 0.37, 95\% confidence interval 0.171--0.812, p ؍ 0.013). The incidence of death from hemorrhage was higher in the low F:R group, 23/27 (85\%), compared to the high F:R group, 21/48 (44\%) ( p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions: In patients with combatrelated trauma requiring massive transfusion, the transfusion of an increased fibrinogen: RBC ratio was independently associated with improved survival to hospital discharge, primarily by decreasing death from hemorrhage. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the best source of fibrinogen and the optimal empiric ratio of fibrinogen to RBCs in patients requiring massive transfusion.},

  abstract = {Background: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is useful in the evaluation of early pregnancy by confirming intrauterine pregnancy and recognizing hemorrhage from ectopic pregnancy. We sought to determine whether transabdominal POCUS by itself or in conjunction with consultative radiology ultrasound (RADUS), reduces Emergency Department (ED) treatment time for patients with ectopic pregnancy requiring operative care, when compared to RADUS alone. A secondary objective was to determine whether the incorporation of POCUS reduces time to operative care for patients with ruptured ectopic pregnancy specifically, when compared to RADUS alone. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients admitted for operative management of ectopic pregnancy. We excluded patients with known ectopic pregnancy and/or imaging prior to arriving to the treatment area, found not to have an ectopic pregnancy, or did not undergo operative care. Descriptive statistics, classical and nonparametric statistical analysis, and linear regression were performed. Results: There were 220 patients admitted with ectopic pregnancy, 111 met exclusion criteria, yielding 109 for analysis. Of 109, 36 received POCUS (23/36 also had RADUS), while 73 received RADUS only. Among the POCUS group 31/36 (86\%) were classified as ruptured versus 47/73 (64\%) in the RADUS group. The average ED treatment time in the POCUS group for all admitted ectopic pregnancies was 157.9 min (standard deviation [SD] 101.3) versus 206.3 min (SD 76.6) in the RADUS group (p = 0.0141). The median time to operating room (OR) for ruptured ectopic pregnancies was 203.0 min (interquartile range [IQR] 159.0) in the POCUS group versus 293.0 min (IQR 139.0) in the RADUS group (p = 0.0002). Regression analysis of the primary outcome was limited by multiple interactions and sample size. When controlling for race, positive shock index and ED visit time, POCUS was found to be associated with a significantly shorter time to OR among ruptured ectopic pregnancies compared to RADUS (p = 0.0052). Conclusion: Compared to RADUS alone, incorporation of POCUS was associated with significantly faster ED treatment time for all ectopic pregnancies and significantly faster time to OR for ruptured ectopic pregnancies, even when combined with RADUS. When controlling for clinical differences, time to OR was still faster for patients who underwent POCUS. The integration of POCUS should be considered to expedite care for patients with ectopic pregnancy requiring operative care.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Many patients who suffer cardiac arrest do not respond to standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation. There is growing interest in utilizing veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (E-CPR) in the management of refractory cardiac arrest. We describe our preliminary experiences in establishing an E-CPR program for refractory cardiac arrest in Melbourne, Australia. Methods: The CHEER trial (mechanical CPR, Hypothermia, ECMO and Early Reperfusion) is a single center, prospective, observational study conducted at The Alfred Hospital. The CHEER protocol was developed for selected patients with refractory in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and involves mechanical CPR, rapid intravenous administration of 30 mL/kg of ice-cold saline to induce intra-arrest therapeutic hypothermia, percutaneous cannulation of the femoral artery and vein by two critical care physicians and commencement of veno-arterial ECMO. Subsequently, patients with suspected coronary artery occlusion are transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for coronary angiography. Therapeutic hypothermia (33 {\textopenbullet}C) is maintained for 24 h in the intensive care unit. Results: There were 26 patients eligible for the CHEER protocol (11 with OHCA, 15 with IHCA). The median age was 52 (IQR 38--60) years. ECMO was established in 24 (92\%), with a median time from collapse until initiation of ECMO of 56 (IQR 40--85) min. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed on 11 (42\%) and pulmonary embolectomy on 1 patient. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 25 (96\%) patients. Median duration of ECMO support was 2 (IQR 1--5) days, with 13/24 (54\%) of patients successfully weaned from ECMO support. Survival to hospital discharge with full neurological recovery (CPC score 1) occurred in 14/26 (54\%) patients. Conclusions: A protocol including E-CPR instituted by critical care physicians for refractory cardiac arrest which includes mechanical CPR, peri-arrest therapeutic hypothermia and ECMO is feasible and associated with a relatively high survival rate.},

Ventilatory parameters (i.e., PaO2/FiO2, dynamic compliance, per cent shunt, and A-a DO2) and extravascular lung water (EVLW) measurements were compared with scintigraphic determinations of pulmonary albumin extravasation. Albumin extravasation data demonstrated a pulmonary capillary permeability increase occurring shortly following trauma. The median albumin extravasation value in the patients within 24 hours of trauma was 3.6 {\texttimes} 10-5sec, compared to a control value of ---0.1 {\textpm} 0.7 {\texttimes} 10-5/sec. Intermediate levels of albumin extravasation were found in patients studied within 48 hours of total hip replacement (1.6 {\textpm} 0. 9 {\texttimes} 10-5/sec). Eighty per cent of patients studied within the first 48 hours of their trauma had albumin extravasation values exceeding the upper limit of normal as determined by the control value + 2 S.D. In contrast to albumin extravasation values, the PaO2/FiO2, dynamic compliance, per cent shunt, A-a DO2, and EVLW did not begin to deteriorate significantly until at least 48 hours after trauma. We conclude that severe multiple trauma induces an early increase in pulmonary capillary permeability as measured by albumin extravasation scintigraphy. This change is not detectable with other commonly used measures. {\copyright} 1986 by The Williams \& Wilkins Co.},

This article reports a  single surgeon's experience of endoscopic retrieval of foreign bodies from the  upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract. Methods A retrospective analysis of data of  all the patients who underwent endoscopic management for foreign body removal by  a single surgeon in a tertiary care hospital in southern India between 2015 and  2020 was conducted. Patient variables in terms of age, sex, type of foreign body,  its location in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the time between ingestion and  presentation, the time between presentation and endoscopy, treatment outcomes  were reviewed. Results A total of 97 patients were studied. The age range of the  patients studied was one month to 71 years. Males were predominant (n=64,  65.97\%). The most common retrieved foreign body were coins (n=31, 31.9\%). The  most common site of foreign body lodgment was the esophagus (n=75, 77.31\%), with  the upper third esophagus (n=38; 39.37\%) being the predominant site. The success  rate of endoscopic retrieval in our study was 97\%. No procedure-related  complications were encountered in any patient. Endoscopic management failed in  two patients who ultimately required surgical intervention. Conclusion Endoscopic  retrieval of foreign bodies in the UGI tract is a safe and effective modality.  Early endoscopy in such patients avoids surgical intervention and reduces  morbidity.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: A bezoar is an indigestible food or other material within the gastrointestinal tract. It can be ingested intentionally or  accidentally. The small bowel bezoar prevalence ranges between 0.4~\% and 4~\%, and  the prevalence is less than 0.5~\% for gastric bezoars. There are different types  of bezoars, but the mention of a plastic bezoar rarely appears in the literature.  To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a plastic bezoar in the  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old woman was admitted for  acute kidney injury, and while working her up, it was discovered that she had a  possible foreign body on computerized tomography scan. As a result, she underwent  exploratory laparotomy with the findings of plastic foreign objects identified  90~cm from the ileocecal valve and other objects identified in the stomach.  CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The impaction of these materials often occurs in narrow  areas such as the lower esophagus, duodenum, ileocecal valve or even the anus. In  this unique case, two points of impaction were noted: the first was in the small  bowel and the second point in the stomach. The approach to such cases could be  Endoscopic versus surgical or even chemical dissolution as a choice of treatment  is dependent on multiple factors. CONCLUSION: The approach to these cases is  multidisciplinary and depends on the availability of services and resources at  the treating hospital. Reporting such cases helps in managing challenging  situations. Additionally, a psychiatric assessment is a crucial step.},

  abstract = {Background: Even though asylum seekers are considered vulnerable to mental ill-health, knowledge of their suicidal behaviour is limited. The aim of this study was to improve our understanding of factors that influence the clinical assessment of asylum seekers who have attempted suicide compared to the assessment of non-asylum seekers. Methods: The study focused on 88 asylum seekers registered for suicide attempts in mental health services 2005--2009, who were matched for age and gender and compared with 88 suicide attempters with Swedish personal identity numbers. The medical records were analysed with a quantitative protocol, focusing on social risk and protective factors, health history, current clinical picture as well as the assessment procedure, diagnostics, patterns of treatment and follow-up in this clinical group. Data was analysed using the chi-square test, Fisher's exact probability test, and the Mann--Whitney U test. Results: As in earlier studies, asylum seekers were more traumatized, had different social risk factors and received different diagnoses than the controls. Asylum seekers were referred to less specialized follow-up after treatment, in spite of their health history and of previous and current clinical pictures indicating a similar or - in the case of the female asylum seekers - more serious mental health condition. Female asylum seekers also received more intense and prolonged in-patient treatment than female controls. Asylum seekers appeared to have social networks more often than the control group. However, there was less documentation of the social context, previous suicidal behaviour, and on suicide in the family and close environment of the asylum-seeking men. Information on suicidal intent was lacking in a majority of both groups. The time relation of the suicide attempt and the asylum process suggested the importance of the asylum decision, as well as the possible role of earlier mental health problems and premigration stress, for the suicidal behaviour. Conclusions: The groups had different sets of risk factors and clinical pictures. There was a lack of early and thorough exploration of suicide intent for both groups, and of contextual and subjective factors for the asylum seekers. Differences in follow-up indicate unequal access to care.},

AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the predictive risk factors associated with the complications of oesophageal foreign bodies. METHODS: Three hundred sixteen cases with foreign bodies in the oesophagus were retrospectively investigated. The predictive risk factors for complications after foreign body ingestion were analysed by multivariate logistic regression, and included age, size and type of foreign body ingested, duration of impaction, and the level of foreign body impaction. RESULTS: The types of oesophageal foreign bodies included fish bones (37.0\%), food (19.0\%), and metals (18.4\%). The complications associated with foreign bodies were ulcers (21.2\%), lacerations (14.9\%), erosions (12.0\%), and perforation (1.9\%). Multivariate analysis showed that the duration of impaction (p{$<$}0.001), and the type (p{$<$}0.001) and size of the foreign bodies (p{$<$}0.001) were significant independent risk factors associated with the development of complications in patients with oesophageal foreign bodies.

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Nasal pharyngolaryngoscopy (NPL) is performed as an outpatient and inpatient procedure on a daily basis, for a variety of indications. It frequently causes some degree of discomfort to the patient. Various different topical agents, which are intended to reduce this discomfort, are in common use. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of the various agents. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of topical preparations used to reduce discomfort and facilitate NPL in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 14 April 2010. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) looking at the effect of topical anaesthetic or vasoconstrictor agents used reduce discomfort and facilitate NPL in adult patients. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for further information where necessary. The primary outcome measured was pain/discomfort. Secondary outcomes that were looked at included side effects of the topical medications, ease of the procedure and the quality of the view from the operator's perspective. Main results We included eight RCTs (746 participants) in the review. The risk of bias in the studies was generally low. Five studies did not demonstrate any advantage in using a topical treatment prior to endoscopy. One study suggested that a vasoconstrictor alone should be used to reduce the general level of unpleasantness. Two studies did not compare treatment against placebo or no treatment, so it was not possible to draw meaningful conclusions from them. There may be some unpleasant side effects from the use of topical preparations, such as unpleasant taste. There was variation in the format of the outcome data and a lack of complete data; none of the included studies reported their results in a way that would allow pooling and we could not therefore perform meta-analysis. Authors' conclusions The included studies do not demonstrate any evidence to support the use of topical treatments prior to the use of a fibre-optic nasal endoscope. Some go as far as to suggest that these agents should not be used due to cost and unpleasant side effects. Five studies did not demonstrate any advantage in terms of reducing pain or discomfort when using a topical treatment prior to endoscopy. The absence of demonstrable effect may be due to relatively small patient groups. It is therefore possible that there is a small effect of using these sprays. Further research using standardised reporting methods is needed. Plain language summary Topical anaesthetic or vasoconstrictor (blood vessel narrowing) preparations for flexible fibre-optic nasal pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy Topical medications are often applied to the inside of a patient's nose prior to examining the nose, sinuses and throat with a flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscope. The aim of this is to reduce any discomfort the patient may feel and also to improve the adequacy of the examination. Types of preparation include lidocaine, phenylephrine and lidocaine, oxymetazoline, xylometazoline and cocaine and they are usually administered as a spray, although they may also be in the form of a solution which can be applied to cotton wool and placed in the nasal cavity, or as gels, pastes or creams. We looked for randomised controlled trials comparing any of these topical treatments with placebo, no treatment or another topical treatment in adult patients undergoing nasal pharyngolaryngoscopy (NPL). We included eight studies in the review (with a total of 746 patients). It was not possible to combine data from any of the studies, therefore we assessed the individual study results. Five of the studies did not demonstrate any advantage, in terms of reducing pain or discomfort, of using a topical treatment prior to endoscopy. One of these suggested that a vasoconstrictor (xylometazoline) alone reduced the level of "general unpleasantness". Two studies did not compare the treatment against placebo or no treatment. A final study actually suggested an increase in pain with the use of topical agents. There may be some unpleasant side effects from the use of topical preparations, such as unpleasant taste. Further standardised research is required.},

Our primary outcome was occurrence of a predefined serious event within 30 days after ED evaluation. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of 30-day serious events. Results: Of 3,727 potentially eligible patients, 2,871 (77\%) met all eligibility criteria. We excluded an additional 287 patients who received a diagnosis of a serious clinical condition while in the ED. In the final study cohort (nϭ2,584), we identified 173 (7\%) patients who experienced a 30-day serious event. High-risk predictors included age greater than 90 years, male sex, history of an arrhythmia, triage systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg, abnormal ECG result, and abnormal troponin I level. A low-risk predictor was a complaint of near syncope rather than syncope. A risk score, generated by summing high-risk predictors and subtracting the low-risk predictor, can stratify patients into low- (event rate 2.5\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.4\% to 3.6\%), intermediate- (event rate 6.3\%; 95\% CI 5.1\% to 7.5\%), and high-risk (event rate 20\%; 95\% CI 15\% to 25\%) groups. Conclusion: We identified predictors of 30-day serious events after syncope in adults aged 60 years and greater. A simple score was able to stratify these patients into distinct risk groups and, if externally validated, might have the potential to aid ED decisionmaking. [Ann Emerg Med. 2009;54:769-778.]},

The First International Workshop on Syncope Risk Stratification in the Emergency Department identified key research questions and methodological standards essential to advancing the science of ED-based syncope research. Methods We recruited a multinational panel of syncope experts. A preconference survey identified research priorities, which were refined during and after the conference through an iterative review process. Results There were 31 participants from 7 countries who represented 10 clinical and methodological specialties. High-priority research recommendations were organized around a conceptual model of ED decisionmaking for syncope, and they address definition, cohort selection, risk stratification, and management. Conclusion We convened a multispecialty group of syncope experts to identify the most pressing knowledge gaps and defined a high-priority research agenda to improve the care of patients with syncope in the ED.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coins are made of metal, which is generally radiopaque, and so physicians often have the misconception that all coins are detectable by  radiography. Here, we report a case of intentionally swallowed coins in the  oesophagus of an adult; the coins could not be detected on chest radiography but  were detected using computed tomography (CT). CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old  woman with a history of depression presented to the emergency department after an  intentional medication overdose and ingestion of two Japanese 1-yen coins. She  complained of persistent retrosternal discomfort. In order to confirm whether the  coins were in the oesophagus or trachea, an anteroposterior chest radiograph was  obtained; however, no coins were detected. Owing to her persistent symptoms, a  chest CT was performed. On the initial CT scan, two 1-yen coins were observed in  the oesophagus: one in the middle oesophagus and the other in the lower  oesophagus. After the scanning, the patient drank water with permission, but  vomited. No coins were found in her vomit, and the symptoms of retrosternal  discomfort had completely disappeared. A subsequent CT scan revealed that the two  1-yen coins were in the patient's stomach. CONCLUSIONS: Japanese 1-yen coins are  made of 100\% aluminium, which is less radiopaque than the metals that make up  coins (nickel, bronze, and lead), and so, they were not visible via chest  radiography in our case. Detecting very small or thin radiolucent foreign bodies  is not possible using a chest radiograph or contrast oesophagram, but is possible  via CT. CT is both increasingly convenient and non-invasive, unlike endoscopy or  bronchoscopy, and so, the use of CT scans should be considered in cases of  possible radiolucent foreign body ingestion.},

Background and Aim: Foreign body ingestion is a common cause for emergency department presentation. In adults, foreign body ingestion is more common in patients with underlying psychiatric comorbidity, the elderly, alcohol intoxication and prisoners. This study reviewed the management of patients presenting to a tertiary hospital with foreign body ingestion. Methods: A retrospective review of patients presenting with foreign body ingestion to a tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Victoria, was undertaken from January 2017 to December 2021. Patients were identified through medical records and data collected included patient demographics, descriptive data on the type of foreign body, length of stay, imaging modalities, management strategies and complications. Results: A total of 157 presentations by 62 patients with foreign body ingestion occurred between 2017 and 2021 (50\% male; median age 30 years). 82\% of patients had underlying psychiatric comorbidity and two-thirds had a previous history of self-harm. The majority of presentations occurred in prisoners (65\%). The most commonly ingested objects were batteries (23\%), alleged drug-containing balloons (17\%), razor blades (16\%), magnets (4\%) and miscellaneous (40\%) (Figure 1). High-risk ingestion, defined as sharp objects, length {$>$}5cm, diameter {$>$}2.5cm, button battery and/or magnet ingestion, and oesophageal location occurred in approximately two thirds of presentations. Most presentations (90\%) underwent radiological evaluation on admission, with the majority (67\%) having plain radiographs. Conservative management, defined as inpatient or outpatient observation, was the most common approach in 55\%. High-risk ingestions were more likely to be managed endoscopically compared with low-risk ingestions (51\% vs. 26\%; p=0.002). Patients presenting with high-risk ingestion were equally likely to be managed conservatively as they were endoscopically (46\% vs. 51\%; p=0.549). The median time to endoscopy in patients with high-risk foreign body located in the stomach was 19 hours. The median length of stay for all presentations was 2 days and did not differ between patients receiving conservative vs. endoscopic management (median 2.1 vs. 2.4 days). Complications, defined as perforation, bowel obstruction or fistula formation, did not occur in this cohort despite more than a half presenting with high-risk ingestions. 30-day re-presentation rates were high (31\%) and re-presentation rates did not differ between patients managed conservatively and endoscopically (29\% vs. 33\%; p=0.787). Conclusion: Conservative management for patients presenting with recurrent high-risk foreign body ingestion was safe in appropriately selected cases (Figure 2).

We present the case of a 26-year-old man who was brought from a  correctional facility after confessing to have swallowed a few shower curtain  hooks. Abdominal X-ray done in the emergency room revealed multiple foreign  bodies in the stomach. An upper endoscopy was done in the emergency room with the  use of an overtube. The first metal piece was caught by a snare and removed with  the endoscope. All other foreign bodies which were present on the abdominal X-ray  could not be visualized initially as there was retained food in the stomach.  After multiple attempts, four other foreign bodies were found and each one was  caught by the forceps and then the scope was removed with the forceps holding the  foreign body. There was an additional foreign body in the right mainstem  bronchus. The patient had coughed up the foreign body and swallowed it into the  gastrointestinal tract. A computed tomography scan of chest and abdomen was done  for evaluation, which showed the foreign body in the cecum. To our knowledge,  this is the first case report of a patient intentionally transferring a foreign  body from one organ system to another. Colonoscopy was done and the foreign body  was removed rectally with a snare without any complications.},

Results: Age, sex, Injury Severity Score, chest Abbreviated Injury Score, number of rib fractures, severity of lung contusion, and PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission were all equivalent in the two groups.

Percent forced vital capacity was higher in the S group at 1 month and thereafter (p {$<$} 0.05). The percentage of patients who had returned to full-time employment at 6 months was significantly higher in the S group (11 of 18) than in the I group (1 of 19). Conclusion: This study proved that in severe flail chest patients, surgical stabilization using Judet struts has beneficial effects with respect to less ventilatory support, lower incidence of pneumonia, shorter trauma intensive care unit stay, and reduced medical cost than internal fixation. Moreover, surgical stabilization with Judet struts improved percent forced vital capacity from the early phase after surgical fixation. Also, patients with surgical stabilization could return to their previous employment quicker than those with internal pneumatic stabilization, even in those with the same severity of flail chest. We therefore concluded that surgical stabilization with Judet struts may be preferably applied to patients with severe flail chest who need ventilator support.},

We aimed to analyze the different etiologies and clinical characteristics of acute  non-traumatic colon perforation beyond the neonatal period and to identify  surgical management and outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective study included 18  patients admitted with acute colon perforation and who received surgical  treatment. RESULTS: Age of patients ranged between 1 month and 15 years. Five  patients swallowed foreign objects (two swallowed magnets), two had colon  perforation secondary to a malignant tumor (both colorectal adenocarcinoma) and  two were iatrogenic (one prior colonoscopy, one air enema for intussusception).  There was one perforation due to chemotherapy and Amyand's hernia respectively.  The remaining seven patients had unknown etiologies; five of them were diagnosed  with colitis. Fifteen (83.3\,\%) patients underwent open laparotomy, among which  four attempted laparoscopy first. Three (16.7\,\%) patients underwent laparoscopic  surgery. Fourteen (77.8\,\%) patients received simple suture repairs and four  (22.2\,\%) received colonic resections and anastomosis. Four (22.2\,\%) patients  received a protective diverting colostomy and three (16.7\,\%) received an  ileostomy. CONCLUSIONS: There is a wide range of etiology besides necrotizing  enterocolitis and trauma, but a significant portion of children present with  unknown etiology. Type of surgery elected should be dependent on the patient's  etiology, disease severity and experience of surgeons.},

  abstract = {Objective: Self-harm and attempted suicide are risk factors for suicide in psychiatric hospital in-patients. This study aimed to analyse the circumstances of self-harm and suicide attempts in a Japanese psychiatric hospital so as to improve management and care. Methods: Incident reports of self-harm and suicide attempts during a 12.4-year period from November 2000 to March 2013 were reviewed. A descriptive analysis was conducted in terms of age, sex, and diagnosis of patients, as well as level, ward, situations, and causes of incidents. Results: During the study period, 90 cases of self-harm and attempted suicide involving 58 patients were reported. The rate of self-harm and suicide attempts was 0.05 per 1000 patient-days. The types of self-harm and suicide attempts included hanging (n = 25), wrist cutting (n = 19), ingestion of foreign objects (n = 17), and others (n = 29). The single case of completed suicide involved hanging, in a patient with schizophrenia. Among 55 patients with relevant data, the most common clinical diagnosis was mood disorder (41.8\%), followed by schizophrenia (36.4\%). Mood disorder was 3.5 times as prevalent in females as in males (14 vs. 4). Fourteen patients with mood disorder (n = 8) or schizophrenia (n = 6) were repeatedly involved in 46 of 89 cases of self-harm or attempted suicide; 11 were female. One woman with mood disorder attempted suicide 9 times within the same year. The top 3 management and care factors related to self-harm and suicide attempts were failure to adhere to preventive procedures (28\%), insufficient therapeutic communication (28\%), and difficulty in predicting suicide (20\%). Conclusion: Self-harm and suicide attempts at this psychiatric hospital occurred at a rate of 0.05 per 1000 patient-days between late 2000 and early 2013. Efforts are needed to increase compliance with suicide prevention procedures and therapeutic communication, so as to improve management and care of psychiatric in-patients and prevent them from committing suicide.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meta-analysis of preclinical data is used to evaluate the consistency of findings and to inform the design and conduct of future studies. Unlike clinical meta-analysis, preclinical data often involve many heterogeneous studies reporting outcomes from a small number of animals. Here, we review the methodological challenges in preclinical meta-analysis in estimating and explaining heterogeneity in treatment effects. METHODS: Assuming aggregate-level data, we focus on two topics: (1) estimation of heterogeneity using commonly used methods in preclinical meta-analysis: method of moments (DerSimonian and Laird; DL), maximum likelihood (restricted maximum likelihood; REML) and Bayesian approach; (2) comparison of univariate versus multivariable meta-regression for adjusting estimated treatment effects for heterogeneity. Using data from a systematic review on the efficacy of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in animals with stroke, we compare these methods, and explore the impact of multiple covariates on the treatment effects. RESULTS: We observed that the three methods for estimating heterogeneity yielded similar estimates for the overall effect, but different estimates for between-study variability. The proportion of heterogeneity explained by a covariate is estimated larger using REML and the Bayesian method as compared with DL. Multivariable meta-regression explains more heterogeneity than univariate meta-regression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the importance of careful selection of the estimation method and the use of multivariable meta-regression to explain heterogeneity. There was no difference between REML and the Bayesian method and both methods are recommended over DL. Multiple meta-regression is worthwhile to explain heterogeneity by more than one variable, reducing more variability than any univariate models and increasing the explained proportion of heterogeneity.},

Continually changing working teams in the Emergency Department does not always allow appropriate debriefing for difficult patient encounters and outcomes on shift. To address these challenges, we sought to adapt and implement a peer-support rounds called `Ice Cream Rounds' used in some Pediatric training programs for an EM training program. Methods: CCFP and Royal College EM residents were surveyed to determine interest and need for Ice Cream Rounds. Of the 31/50 respondents, 87\% (26/31) identified their co-residents as their main source of support after difficult patient encounters and 71\% (22/ 31) felt that current opportunities to debrief after difficult experiences were only ``sometimes'' or ``rarely'' adequate. Overall, 84\% (26/31) were interested in attending Ice Cream Rounds. Residents expressed that they did not want staff present for Ice Cream Rounds so two residents (SCS and TK) obtained training to lead peer-support sessions from The Faculty of Medicine Wellness Program. Attendance at rounds was voluntary and the EM program provided funding for refreshments. Two Ice Cream Rounds were piloted. Attendance and feedback was recorded from pilot sessions. Curriculum, Tool, or Material: Resident-only, peer-run confidential debriefing sessions. Sessions were voluntary and lasted one hour. Approximately 20-30/50 residents attended each Ice Cream Rounds. Discussions were confidential but include topics such as difficult patient encounters, poor patient outcomes, challenges in residency, and ethical issues. In response to positive attendance and feedback, the EM program provided 3-4 one-hour protected time slots with a stipend for refreshments for future academic years. Comments from residents consistently reaffirmed that Ice Cream Rounds was a helpful forum to discuss important issues with colleagues and provided a safe and confidential resource to help cope with residency challenges. Conclusion: We adapted, implemented, and evaluated a novel PeerSupport Wellness Rounds for debriefing resident issues and difficult patient encounters in a EM training program. To our knowledge this is the first Canadian initiative to implement such rounds in an EM training program. We believe that this template can be easily adopted by any EM training program and will effectively address wellness challenges faced by residents during their training.},

A 41-year-old male patient with intellectual disabilities presented after having swallowed approximately 20 sharp objects. While admitted to a psychiatric ward, surgeons removed a glove from his stomach endoscopically and pharmacologically facilitated the objects' complication-free bowel passage. The patient explained the swallowing as a means to release himself from tension induced by stress. His aberrant behavior also seemed to serve as a means to exert pressure on psychosocial workers. Other deviations included the pushing of sharp objects under the skin and multiple paraphiliae. As a child, the patient suffered from early psychological and physical traumatization. Both parents were allegedly physically abusive alcoholics., Conclusion. Apart from possible alcohol embryopathy and traumatic brain damage, meningitis, which the patient had at the age of three, is discussed as the most likely reason for his oligophrenia, associated with left-sided, temporo-parietal atrophy and epilepsy.},

The  purpose of this work is to study the different presentations of button battery  foreign bodies and present our experience in the diagnosis and management of this  hazardous problem in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 13  patients. The diagnostic protocol was comprised of a thorough history, head and  neck physical examination, and appropriate radiographic evaluation. The button  batteries were emergently extracted under general anesthesia. RESULTS: The  average follow-up period was 4.3 months. Five patients had a nasal button  battery. Four patients had an esophageal button battery. Three patients had a  button battery in the stomach. One patient had a button battery impacted in the  left external ear canal. Apart from a nasal septal perforation and a tympanic  membrane perforation, no major complications were detected. CONCLUSION: Early  detection is the key in the management of button battery foreign bodies. They  have a distinctive appearance on radiography, and its prompt removal is  mandatory, especially for batteries lodged in the esophagus. Physicians must  recognize the hazardous potential and serious implications of such an accident.  There is a need for more public education about this serious problem.},

(A 'service user' may be using any specialist learning disability health or social care facility with day, residential or therapeutic services). Of the 674 service users for whom surveys were returned, 47 were living in hospital, 396 were living in residential or group homes and 208 were living with relatives, or in their own homes. Eighteen subjects who had reported serious or repeated episodes of choking were interviewed in depth in their residences or workplaces. Responses were subjected to frequency analyses. Personal characteristics were analysed. Choking patterns were differentiated by food texture. Results. A total of 34\% of questionnaires on 674 service users were returned; 42\% of respondents reported one or more choking episodes. There was a significantly greater occurrence of choking among people with more severe learning disability, with Down syndrome, people who had an incomplete dentition or were taking a greater number of psychotropic drugs. Antisocial eating habits learnt in institutional settings presented an additional choking hazard for some individuals. Conclusion. Choking is a serious hazard for many adults with learning disabilities. This study establishes many of the characteristics associated with swallowing problems in this population. Clinicians and carers should benefit from awareness of these predictors, leading to better management of eating behaviours and habits. A choking and swallowing risk assessment should be included in routine health assessments of adults with learning disability, paying especial attention to the condition of a person's teeth; possible side effects from prescribed medication, and abnormal eating behaviour.},

However, its effectiveness is uncertain. Methods In this trial conducted at 51 centers (mostly in Australia or New Zealand), we randomly assigned patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock to receive either EGDT or usual care. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 90 days after randomization. Results Of the 1600 enrolled patients, 796 were assigned to the EGDT group and 804 to the usual-care group. Primary outcome data were available for more than 99\% of the patients. Patients in the EGDT group received a larger mean ({\textpm}SD) volume of intravenous fluids in the first 6 hours after randomization than did those in the usualcare group (1964{\textpm}1415 ml vs. 1713{\textpm}1401 ml) and were more likely to receive vasopressor infusions (66.6\% vs. 57.8\%), red-cell transfusions (13.6\% vs. 7.0\%), and dobutamine (15.4\% vs. 2.6\%) (P{$<$}0.001 for all comparisons). At 90 days after randomization, 147 deaths had occurred in the EGDT group and 150 had occurred in the usual-care group, for rates of death of 18.6\% and 18.8\%, respectively (absolute risk difference with EGDT vs. usual care, -0.3 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval, -4.1 to 3.6; P\,=\,0.90). There was no significant difference in survival time, in-hospital mortality, duration of organ support, or length of hospital stay. Conclusions In critically ill patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock, EGDT did not reduce all-cause mortality at 90 days.

  abstract = {Background: The aim of this study is to validate a previously published consensus-based quality indicator set for the management of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) at intensive care units (ICUs) in Europe and to study its potential for quality measurement and improvement. Methods: Our analysis was based on 2006 adult patients admitted to 54 ICUs between 2014 and 2018, enrolled in the CENTER-TBI study. Indicator scores were calculated as percentage adherence for structure and process indicators and as event rates or median scores for outcome indicators. Feasibility was quantified by the completeness of the variables. Discriminability was determined by the between-centre variation, estimated with a random effect regression model adjusted for case-mix severity and quantified by the median odds ratio (MOR). Statistical uncertainty of outcome indicators was determined by the median number of events per centre, using a cut-off of 10. Results: A total of 26/42 indicators could be calculated from the CENTER-TBI database. Most quality indicators proved feasible to obtain with more than 70\% completeness. Sub-optimal adherence was found for most quality indicators, ranging from 26 to 93\% and 20 to 99\% for structure and process indicators. Significant (p {$<$} 0.001) between-centre variation was found in seven process and five outcome indicators with MORs ranging from 1.51 to 4.14. Statistical uncertainty of outcome indicators was generally high; five out of seven had less than 10 events per centre. Conclusions: Overall, nine structures, five processes, but none of the outcome indicators showed potential for quality improvement purposes for TBI patients in the ICU. Future research should focus on implementation efforts and continuous reevaluation of quality indicators. Trial registration: The core study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02210221, registered on August 06, 2014, with Resource Identification Portal (RRID: SCR\_015582).},

In the fluid restriction group fluid boluses were permitted only if signs of severe hypoperfusion occurred, while in the standard care group fluid boluses were permitted as long as circulation continued to improve. Results:{\enspace} The co-primary outcome measures, resuscitation fluid volumes at day 5 and during ICU stay, were lower in the fluid restriction group than in the standard care group [mean differences -1.2 L (95 \% confidence interval -2.0 to -0.4); p {$<$} 0.001 and -1.4 L (-2.4 to -0.4) respectively; p {$<$} 0.001]. Neither total fluid inputs and balances nor serious adverse reactions differed statistically significantly between the groups. Major protocol violations occurred in 27/75 patients in the fluid restriction group. Ischaemic events occurred in 3/75 in the fluid restriction group vs. 9/76 in the standard care group (odds ratio 0.32; 0.08--1.27; p = 0.11), worsening of acute kidney injury in 27/73 vs. 39/72 (0.46; 0.23--0.92; p = 0.03), and death by 90 days in 25/75 vs. 31/76 (0.71; 0.36--1.40; p = 0.32).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients who are undergoing mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) often receive a high fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) and have a high arterial oxygen tension. The conservative use of oxygen may reduce oxygen exposure, diminish lung and systemic oxidative injury, and thereby increase the number of ventilator-free days (days alive and free from mechanical ventilation). METHODS We randomly assigned 1000 adult patients who were anticipated to require mechanical ventilation beyond the day after recruitment in the ICU to receive conservative or usual oxygen therapy. In the two groups, the default lower limit for oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Spo2) was 90\%. In the conservativeoxygen group, the upper limit of the Spo2 alarm was set to sound when the level reached 97\%, and the Fio2 was decreased to 0.21 if the Spo2 was above the acceptable lower limit. In the usual-oxygen group, there were no specific measures limiting the Fio2 or the Spo2. The primary outcome was the number of ventilatorfree days from randomization until day 28. RESULTS The number of ventilator-free days did not differ significantly between the conservative-oxygen group and the usual-oxygen group, with a median duration of 21.3 days (interquartile range, 0 to 26.3) and 22.1 days (interquartile range, 0 to 26.2), respectively, for an absolute difference of -0.3 days (95\% confidence interval [CI], -2.1 to 1.6; P\,=\,0.80). The conservative-oxygen group spent more time in the ICU with an Fio2 of 0.21 than the usual-oxygen group, with a median duration of 29 hours (interquartile range, 5 to 78) and 1 hour (interquartile range, 0 to 17), respectively (absolute difference, 28 hours; 95\% CI, 22 to 34); the conservative-oxygen group spent less time with an Spo2 exceeding 96\%, with a duration of 27 hours (interquartile range, 11 to 63.5) and 49 hours (interquartile range, 22 to 112), respectively (absolute difference, 22 hours; 95\% CI, 14 to 30). At 180 days, mortality was 35.7\% in the conservative-oxygen group and 34.5\% in the usual-oxygen group, for an unadjusted odds ratio of 1.05 (95\% CI, 0.81 to 1.37).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND After a single-center trial and observational studies suggesting that early, goaldirected therapy (EGDT) reduced mortality from septic shock, three multicenter trials (ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe) showed no benefit. This meta-analysis of individual patient data from the three recent trials was designed prospectively to improve statistical power and explore heterogeneity of treatment effect of EGDT. METHODS We harmonized entry criteria, intervention protocols, outcomes, resource-use measures, and data collection across the trials and specified all analyses before unblinding. After completion of the trials, we pooled data, excluding the protocolbased standard-therapy group from the ProCESS trial, and resolved residual differences. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included 1-year survival, organ support, and hospitalization costs. We tested for treatmentby-subgroup interactions for 16 patient characteristics and 6 care-delivery characteristics. RESULTS We studied 3723 patients at 138 hospitals in seven countries. Mortality at 90 days was similar for EGDT (462 of 1852 patients [24.9\%]) and usual care (475 of 1871 patients [25.4\%]); the adjusted odds ratio was 0.97 (95\% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.14; P\,=\,0.68). EGDT was associated with greater mean ({\textpm}SD) use of intensive care (5.3{\textpm}7.1 vs. 4.9{\textpm}7.0 days, P\,=\,0.04) and cardiovascular support (1.9{\textpm}3.7 vs. 1.6{\textpm}2.9 days, P\,=\,0.01) than was usual care; other outcomes did not differ significantly, although average costs were higher with EGDT. Subgroup analyses showed no benefit from EGDT for patients with worse shock (higher serum lactate level, combined hypotension and hyperlactatemia, or higher predicted risk of death) or for hospitals with a lower propensity to use vasopressors or fluids during usual resuscitation. CONCLUSIONS In this meta-analysis of individual patient data, EGDT did not result in better outcomes than usual care and was associated with higher hospitalization costs across a broad range of patient and hospital characteristics.

  abstract = {Background In a single-center study published more than a decade ago involving patients presenting to the emergency department with severe sepsis and septic shock, mortality was markedly lower among those who were treated according to a 6-hour protocol of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT), in which intravenous fluids, vasopressors, inotropes, and blood transfusions were adjusted to reach central hemodynamic targets, than among those receiving usual care. We conducted a trial to determine whether these findings were generalizable and whether all aspects of the protocol were necessary. Methods In 31 emergency departments in the United States, we randomly assigned patients with septic shock to one of three groups for 6 hours of resuscitation: protocol-based EGDT; protocol-based standard therapy that did not require the placement of a central venous catheter, administration of inotropes, or blood transfusions; or usual care. The primary end point was 60-day in-hospital mortality. We tested sequentially whether protocol-based care (EGDT and standard-therapy groups combined) was superior to usual care and whether protocol-based EGDT was superior to protocol-based standard therapy. Secondary outcomes included longer-term mortality and the need for organ support. Results We enrolled 1341 patients, of whom 439 were randomly assigned to protocol-based EGDT, 446 to protocol-based standard therapy, and 456 to usual care. Resuscitation strategies differed significantly with respect to the monitoring of central venous pressure and oxygen and the use of intravenous fluids, vasopressors, inotropes, and blood transfusions. By 60 days, there were 92 deaths in the protocol-based EGDT group (21.0\%), 81 in the protocol-based standard-therapy group (18.2\%), and 86 in the usual-care group (18.9\%) (relative risk with protocol-based therapy vs. usual care, 1.04; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.31; P\,=\,0.83; relative risk with protocol-based EGDT vs. protocol-based standard therapy, 1.15; 95\% CI, 0.88 to 1.51; P\,=\,0.31).

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To validate the Canadian Syncope Risk Score (CSRS) in a new cohort of patients with syncope to determine its ability to predict 30-day serious outcomes not evident during index ED evaluation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective multicenter cohort study conducted at 9 EDs across Canada included patients 16 years and older who presented to EDs within 24 hours of syncope. Patients were enrolled from March 2014 to April 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Baseline characteristics, CSRS predictors, and 30-day adjudicated serious outcomes, including arrhythmic (arrhythmias, interventions for arrhythmia, or unknown cause of death) and nonarrhythmic (myocardial infarction, structural heart disease, pulmonary embolism, or hemorrhage) serious outcomes, were collected. Calibration and discrimination characteristics for CSRS validation were calculated. RESULTS A total of 3819 patients were included (mean [SD] age 53.9 [22.8] years; 2088 [54.7\%] female), of whom 139 (3.6\%) experienced 30-day serious outcomes, including 13 patients (0.3\%) who died. In the validation cohort, there were no differences between the predicted and observed risk, the calibration slope was 1.0, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.91 (95\% CI, 0.88-0.93). The empirical probability of a 30-day serious outcome during validation was 3.64\% (95\% CI, 3.09\%-4.28\%) compared with the model-predicted probability of 3.17\% (95\% CI, 2.66\%-3.77\%; P = .26). The proportion of patients with 30-day serious outcomes increased from 3 of 1631 (0.3\%) in the very-low-risk group to 40 of 78 (51.3\%) in the very-high-risk group (Cochran-Armitage trend test P {$<$} .001). There was a similar significant increase in the serious outcome subtypes with increasing CSRS risk category. None of the very-low-risk and low-risk patients died or experienced ventricular arrhythmia. At a threshold score of -1 (2145 of 3819 patients), the CSRS sensitivity and specificity were 97.8\% (95\% CI, 93.8\%-99.6\%) and 44.3\% (95\% CI, 42.7\%-45.9\%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The CSRS was successfully validated and its use is recommended to guide ED management of patients when serious causes are not identified during index ED evaluation. Very-low-risk and low-risk patients can generally be discharged, while brief hospitalization can be considered for high-risk patients. We believe CSRS implementation has the potential to improve patient safety and health care efficiency.},

  abstract = {Background{\enspace} The WHO and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend various triage tools to assist decision-\-making for patients with suspected COVID-19. We aimed to compare the accuracy of triage tools for predicting severe illness in adults presenting to the ED with suspected COVID-19. Methods{\enspace} We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 EDs across the UK. We collected data from people attending with suspected COVID-19 and used presenting data to determine the results of assessment with the WHO algorithm, National Early Warning Score version 2 (NEWS2), CURB-65, CRB-65, Pandemic Modified Early Warning Score (PMEWS) and the swine flu adult hospital pathway (SFAHP). We used 30-\-day outcome data (death or receipt of respiratory, cardiovascular or renal support) to determine prognostic accuracy for adverse outcome. Results{\enspace} We analysed data from 20\,891 adults, of whom 4611 (22.1\%) died or received organ support (primary outcome), with 2058 (9.9\%) receiving organ support and 2553 (12.2\%) dying without organ support (secondary outcomes). C-s\- tatistics for the primary outcome were: CURB-65 0.75; CRB-65 0.70; PMEWS 0.77; NEWS2 (score) 0.77; NEWS2 (rule) 0.69; SFAHP (6-p\- oint rule) 0.70; SFAHP (7-\-point rule) 0.68; WHO algorithm 0.61. All triage tools showed worse prediction for receipt of organ support and better prediction for death without organ support. At the recommended threshold, PMEWS and the WHO criteria showed good sensitivity (0.97 and 0.95, respectively) at the expense of specificity (0.30 and 0.27, respectively). The NEWS2 score showed similar sensitivity (0.96) and specificity (0.28) when a lower threshold than recommended was used. Conclusion{\enspace} CURB-65, PMEWS and the NEWS2 score provide good but not excellent prediction for adverse outcome in suspected COVID-19, and predicted death without organ support better than receipt of organ support. PMEWS, the WHO criteria and NEWS2 (using a lower threshold than usually recommended) provide good sensitivity at the expense of specificity.},

The duration of follow-up was 90 days. Eligibility criteria included a blood culture positive for growth of gram-negative bacteria, clinical stability within 4 days of initial blood culture, an available susceptibility report on day 4, and initiation of appropriate empirical IV antibiotic treatment within 24 hours of blood culture.Switching to oral antibiotics within 4 days after initial blood culture compared with continuing IV antibiotic treatment for at least 5 days after initial blood culture.The main outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied to adjust for confounding. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed using pooled logistic regression to estimate absolute risk, risk difference (RD), and risk ratio (RR); 95\% CIs were computed using bootstrapping.A total of 914 individuals were included in the target trial emulation analysis (512 [56.0\%] male; median age, 74.5 years [IQR, 63.3-83.2 years]); 433 (47.4\%) transitioned early to oral antibiotic treatment, and 481 (52.6\%) received prolonged IV treatment. Ninety-nine individuals (10.8\%) died during follow-up. The proportion of individuals who died was higher in the group receiving prolonged IV treatment (69 [14.3\%] vs 30 [6.9\%]). In the intention-to-treat analysis, 90-day all-cause mortality risk was 9.1\% (95\% CI, 6.7\%-11.6\%) for the early-switch group and 11.7\% (95\% CI, 9.6\%-13.8\%) for the group receiving prolonged IV treatment; the RD was -2.5\% (95\% CI, -5.7\% to 0.7\%) and RR was 0.78 (95\% CI, 0.60-1.10). In the per-protocol analysis, the RD was -0.1\% (95\% CI, -3.4\% to 3.1\%) and RR was 0.99 (95\% CI, 0.70-1.40).In this cohort study of uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia, early transition to oral antibiotics within 4 days of initial blood culture was associated with 90-day all-cause mortality risk comparable to that of continuing IV antibiotic treatment and may be an effective alternative to prolonged IV treatment.},

Laboratory studies and an increasing number of observational studies have raised the possibility that prolonged RBC storage adversely affects clinical outcomes. In this article, the laboratory and animal experiments evaluating changes to RBCs during prolonged storage are reviewed. Subsequently, the clinical studies that have evaluated the clinical consequences of prolonged RBC storage are reviewed.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although detailed analyses of the postmortem findings of various critically ill patient groups have been published, no such study has been performed in patients with sepsis. In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed macroscopic postmortem examinations of surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients who died from sepsis or septic shock. METHODS: Between 1997 and 2006, the ICU database and autopsy register were reviewed for patients who were admitted to the ICU because of sepsis/septic shock, or who developed sepsis/septic shock at a later stage during their ICU stay and subsequently died from of sepsis/septic shock. Clinical data and postmortem findings were documented in all patients. RESULTS: Postmortem results of 235 patients (84.8\%) were available for statistical analysis. The main causes of death as reported in the patient history were refractory multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (51.5\%) and uncontrollable cardiovascular failure (35.3\%). Pathologies were detected in the lungs (89.8\%), kidneys/urinary tract (60\%), gastrointestinal tract (54\%), cardiovascular system (53.6\%), liver (47.7\%), spleen (33.2\%), central nervous system (18.7\%), and pancreas (8.5\%). In 180 patients (76.6\%), the autopsy revealed a continuous septic focus. The most common continuous foci were pneumonia (41.3\%), tracheobronchitis (28.9\%), peritonitis (23.4\%), uterine/ovarial necrosis (9.8\% of female patients), intraabdominal abscesses (9.1\%), and pyelonephritis (6\%). A continuous septic focus was observed in 63 of the 71 patients (88.7\%) who were admitted to the ICU because of sepsis/septic shock and treated for longer than 7 days. CONCLUSIONS: Relevant postmortem findings explaining death in surgical ICU patients who died because of sepsis/septic shock were a continuous septic focus in approximately 80\% and cardiac pathologies in 50\%. The most frequently affected organs were the lungs, abdomen, and urogenital tract. More diagnostic, therapeutic and scientific efforts should be launched to identify and control the infectious focus in patients with sepsis and septic shock.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As a significant proportion of patients receiving palliative care suffer from states of anxiety, depression, delirium, or other mental symptoms, psychiatry and palliative care already collaborate closely in the palliative care of medical conditions. Despite this well-established involvement of psychiatrists in palliative care, psychiatry does not currently explicitly provide palliative care for patients with mental illness outside the context of terminal medical illness. DISCUSSION: Based on the WHO definition of palliative care, a, a working definition of palliative psychiatry is proposed. Palliative psychiatry focuses on mental health rather than medical/physical issues. We propose that the beneficiaries of palliative psychiatry are patients with severe persistent mental illness, who are at risk of therapeutic neglect and/or overly aggressive care within current paradigms. These include long-term residential care patients with severe chronic schizophrenia and insufficient quality of life, those with therapy-refractory depressions and repeated suicide attempts, and those with severe long-standing therapy-refractory anorexia nervosa. An explicitly palliative approach within psychiatry has the potential to improve quality of care, person-centredness, outcomes, and autonomy for patients with severe persistent mental illness. CONCLUSIONS: The first step towards a palliative psychiatry is to acknowledge those palliative approaches that already exist implicitly in psychiatry. Basic skills for a palliative psychiatry include communication of diagnosis and prognosis, symptom assessment and management, support for advance (mental health) care planning, assessment of caregiver needs, and referral to specialized services. Some of these may already be considered core skills of psychiatrists, but for a truly palliative approach they should be exercised guided by an awareness of the limited functional prognosis and lifespan of patients with severe persistent mental illness.},

Compared with manual chest com- pression, an automated load-distributing band (LDB) chest compression device pro- duces greater blood flow to vital organs and may improve resuscitation outcomes. Objective To compare resuscitation outcomes following out-of-hospital cardiac ar- rest when an automated LDB-CPR device was added to standard emergency medical services (EMS) care with manual CPR. Design, Setting, and Patients Multicenter, randomized trial of patients experi- encing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United States and Canada. The a priori pri- mary population was patients with cardiac arrest that was presumed to be of cardiac origin and that had occurred prior to the arrival of EMS personnel. Initial study enroll- ment varied by site, ranging from late July to mid November 2004; all sites halted study enrollment on March 31, 2005. Intervention Standard EMS care for cardiac arrest with an LDB-CPR device (n=554) or manual CPR (n=517). Main OutcomeMeasures The primary end point was survival to 4 hours after the 911 call. Secondary end points were survival to hospital discharge and neurological status among survivors. Results Following the first planned interim monitoring conducted by an independent data and safety monitoring board, study enrollment was terminated. No difference ex- isted in the primary end point of survival to 4 hours between the manual CPR group and the LDB-CPR group overall (N=1071; 29.5\% vs 28.5\%; P=.74) or among the pri- mary study population (n=767;24.7\%vs 26.4\%, respectively; P=.62). However,among the primary population, survival to hospital discharge was9.9\%in the manualCPRgroup and 5.8\% in the LDB-CPR group (P=.06, adjusted for covariates and clustering). A ce- rebral performance category of 1 or 2 at hospital discharge was recorded in 7.5\% of patients in the manual CPR group and in 3.1\% of the LDB-CPR group (P=.006). Conclusions Use of an automated LDB-CPR device as implemented in this study was associated with worse neurological outcomes and a trend toward worse survival than manual CPR. Device design or implementation strategies require further evaluation.},

It is associated with serious physical complications, including bowel obstruction, perforation and haemorrhage. Episodes of deliberate foreign body ingestion were identified retrospectively from 5417 incident records from two inpatient forensic services (one mental health and one intellectual disability) over a one year timeframe, using related search terms. Rates were compared according to gender, diagnosis and level of security. Incidents of deliberate foreign body ingestion were found to occur on average every 2.7 days across the study population, with 133 incidents recorded over a one year period, accounted for by 27 patients. Women and patients in lower levels of security were significantly more likely to engage in deliberate foreign body ingestion. Staff responses to this behaviour were highly variable. Deliberate foreign body ingestion occurs frequently within inpatient forensic services, and can have significantly detrimental physical implications for affected patients. Further research should investigate the psychiatric and intellectual disability profile of such individuals in further detail, as well as exploring patient narratives; both of which will help inform development of treatment strategies.

We performed initial imaging within 6 hours of early goal-directed therapy initiation and late follow-up studies at 24-hour intervals until death or resolution of organ dysfunction. We imaged 5 sublingual sites and analyzed the data offline in a blinded fashion. We calculated 3 microcirculatory perfusion indices: flow velocity score, flow heterogeneity index, and capillary density. We analyzed early data to compare survivors versus nonsurvivors and examine correlations with systemic hemodynamic measurements. We used a linear mixed-effects model for longitudinal analyses. Results: We performed 66 orthogonal polarization spectral studies in 26 sepsis patients. Early microcirculatory indices were more markedly impaired (lower flow velocity and more heterogeneous perfusion) in nonsurvivors compared with survivors. These same early indices, flow velocity and heterogeneity, were also more markedly impaired with increasing severity of systemic cardiovascular dysfunction (lower arterial pressure or increasing vasopressor requirement). Conclusion: Early microcirculatory perfusion indices in severe sepsis and septic shock are more markedly impaired in nonsurvivors compared with survivors and with increasing severity of global cardiovascular dysfunction.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Despite the effectiveness of endoscopies in removing ingested foreign bodies (FBs) impacted in the esophagus, the merits and limitations of  flexible endoscopy (FE) and rigid endoscopy (RE) remain unclear. Therefore, this  study compares the advantages and disadvantages of both endoscopic procedures  from a clinical perspective. METHODS: A retrospective review was made of 273  patients suspected of esophageal FBs in emergency consultations of a tertiary  medical referral center from March 2010 to March 2014. All patients received  routine physical examinations, otolaryngological examinations, and X-rays of the  neck and chest. The door-to-endoscopy time, procedure time, postendoscopic  hospital stay, successful removal rates, and complications were analyzed as well.  RESULTS: In this study, the most common esophageal FBs were fish and animal bones  (76\%) in adults and coins (74\%) in children. The patients with existing  esophageal FBs had significantly more frequent symptoms of dysphagia and signs of  linear opacity as detected with lateral neck radiography than those without FB.  Additionally, the door-to-endoscopy time, procedure time, and postendoscopic  hospital stay was significantly shorter in FE patients than in RE patients.  However, both RE and FE patients had high rates of successful FB removal (95\%)  and low complication rates (2\%). CONCLUSION: Both FE and RE remove esophageal FBs  successfully, as evidenced by their high success rates, low complication rates,  and high detection rates. Although FE under local anesthesia is a less  time-consuming procedure for adults, RE under general anesthesia may be  preferable for children and can serve as an alternative to FE.},

Methods: PubMed and EMBASE were searched from inception to July 2016 for eligible studies that evaluated the utility of POC echocardiography in patients with cardiac arrest. Modified QUADAS was used to appraise the quality of included studies. A random-effect bivariate model and a hierarchical summary receiving operating curve were used to summarize the performance characteristics of focused echocardiography. Results: Initial search identified 961 citations of which 15 were included in our final analysis. A total of 1695 patients had POC echocardiography performed during resuscitation. Ultrasonography was mainly utilized to detect spontaneous cardiac movement (SCM) and identify reversible causes of cardiac arrest. Subcostal, apical and parasternal views were used to identify cardiac tamponade, pulmonary embolism, and pleural view for tension pneumothorax. Results of meta-analysis showed that SCM detected by focused echocardiography had a pooled sensitivity (0.95, 95\%CI: 0.72--0.99) and specificity (0.80, 95\%CI: 0.63--0.91) in predicting return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) during cardiac arrest, with a positive likelihood ratio of 4.8 (95\% CI: 2.5--9.4) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.06 (95\%CI: 0.01--0.39). Conclusion: POC focused echocardiography can be used to identify reversible causes and predict shortterm outcome in patients with cardiac arrest. In patients with a low pretest probability for ROSC, absence of SCM on echocardiography can predict a low likelihood of survival and guide the decision of resuscitation termination.},

However, multiple sharply pointed foreign bodies located in different organs are rare conditions and no definite treatment guidelines has been established. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 31-year-old amateur magician visited the outpatient clinic with a chief complaint of epigastric discomfort. He might have accidentally swallowed some needles while practicing a magic trick 2 days before. DIAGNOSIS: Imaging tests revealed 1 needle was stuck in the left liver lobe through the stomach wall, 1 was in the third portion of the duodenum, 3 were in the ascending colon, and 2 were in the transverse colon. INTERVENTIONS: A needle in the duodenum and 5 in the colon were removed by endoscopy. The needle stuck in the liver from the stomach was not visible inside the stomach and was successfully removed by laparoscopy a few days later. OUTCOMES: The patient was able to tolerate an oral diet and was discharged on postoperative day 4 without any complications. LESSONS: Developing a treatment plan in cases of multiple sharp FB may be difficult. A multidisciplinary team of endoscopists and surgeons is needed to determine the best possible treatment plan. This experience illustrates the importance of the planning of the sequence and method of removal of multiple foreign bodies from the gastrointestinal tract.},

  abstract = {Background{\enspace} There has been little research into the prehospital management of cardiac arrest following hanging despite it being among the most prevalent methods of suicide worldwide. The aim of this study was to report the characteristics, resuscitative treatment and outcomes of patients managed in the prehospital environment for cardiac arrest secondary to hanging and compare these with all-\-cause out-o\- f-h\- ospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Methods{\enspace} Data from a UK ambulance service cardiac arrest registry were extracted for all cases in which treatment was provided for OHCA due to hanging between 1 January 2013 and 30 June 2018. Cases were linked to outcome data obtained from the Trauma Audit and Research Network. Comparison of the cohort was made to previously published data from a UK study of all-\-cause OHCA with 95\% CIs calculated for the proportional difference between the studies in selected presentation and outcome variables. Results{\enspace} 189 cases were identified. 95 patients were conveyed to hospital and four of these survived to discharge. 40 patients were conveyed despite absence of a spontaneous circulation and none of these patients survived. While only three patients were initially in a shockable rhythm, DC shocks were administered in 20 cases. There was one case of failed ventilation prompting front-\-of-n\- eck access for oxygenation. By comparison with all-\-cause OHCA the proportion of patients with a spontaneous circulation at hospital handover was similar (27.0\% vs 27.5\%; 0.5\% difference, 95\%\,CI -5.9\% to 6.8\%, p=0.882) but survival to hospital discharge was significantly lower (2.2\% vs 8.4\%; 6.2\% difference, 95\%\,CI 4.1\% to 8.3\%, p=0.002). Conclusion{\enspace} Clinical outcomes following OHCA due to hanging are poor, particularly when patients are transported while in cardiac arrest. Failure to ventilate was uncommon, and clinicians should be alert to the possibility of shockable rhythms developing during resuscitation.},

The purpose of this report is to describe an unusual case of acute appendicitis in adult caused by  accidental ingestion of a needle, and treated with appendectomy. PRESENTATION OF  CASE: A 64 year-old white woman, seamstress, was admitted with abdominal pain  complaints. Plain radiograph and CT scan showed metal density suggesting a  foreign body in the lower right abdomen. A diagnostic laparoscopic procedure  identified a perforated appendicitis due to a needle perforation. Laparoscopic  appendicectomy and foreign body removal were performed. DISCUSSION: Acute  appendicitis due foreign body ingestion is extremely rare. Laparoscopy was the  chosen access once it was more suitable for inventory of the gastrointestinal  tract and help avoiding harm of the medical team during hand maneuvers of open  access surgery. CONCLUSION: Foreign body ingestion should be remembered as an  unusual differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis.},

Here, we present an exceptional and rare case of a  hypodermic needle FB that transmigrated to the left atrium and presented as a  left atrial mass.

An  echocardiogram was performed revealing a left atrial mass concerning for myxoma.  During the surgical removal of the mass, a hypodermic needle was found attached  to the roof of the left atrium surrounded by thrombotic and fibrotic tissue,  which was confirmed by pathology. DISCUSSION: Cardiac FBs are caused generally by  penetrating wounds from direct trauma. Fewer cases have been reported regarding  cardiac FB caused by ingestion from migration of the object to the heart. Signs  and symptoms for cardiac FB may mimic those of cardiac masses. Cardiac FBs often  require surgical intervention to avoid complications.},

  abstract = {Introduction Esophageal perforation in adults is most frequently caused by ingested foreign bodies. They can migrate through the esophageal wall, damaging the nearby organs such as the aorta or the trachea, with fatal outcome. After the diagnosis, the viable treatments for extracting the foreign body and repairing the perforation are several. The appropriate treatment, may be endoscopic, surgical or combined, depending on the level of the perforation, on the co-morbidities of the patient and on the available resources. Presentation of case This paper describes a case of a 68 years old patient with a double EP caused by a meat-bone that perforated the thoracic esophageal wall, approaching the aorta on the left side and the azygos vein on the right side. Discussion Because of the double transfixion and the position near the aorta and the azygos, it was not possible to remove safely the bone during the endoscopy. The management required a combined endoscopic and surgical approach. This way it was possible to detect easily the location of the perforation, to remove safely the foreign body, to repair the perforation both from the outside and from the inside, and to place the nasogastric tube under direct vision. Conclusion Even when the type of esophageal perforation requires surgical treatment, the simultaneous use of endoscopy proved to be an advantage in order to extract the foreign body safely, to perform a double repair of the perforation and to place the nasogastric tube under direct vision.},

For abdominal injuries, however, the sensitivity for detection of injury is low and thus the utility of ultrasound as a screening tool is limited.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The underlying clinical condition and the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) environment make critical illness a stressful event. Although the usual management consists of sedation, non-pharmacological interventions such as music therapy have been suggested for their drug-sparing effect. Aim of the present review is to assess the current evidence on the effectiveness of music therapy in reducing stress and anxiety in critically ill, adult patients. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review of publications was undertaken using MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, Indice Italiano di Letteratura di Scienze Infermieristiche. We included studies of critically ill patients that assessed any effect of music therapy on stress and anxiety, which were variably assessed according to each study's definition. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Eleven studies were included (10 RCTs and one quasi-experimental design), for a total of 959 patients (range 17-373). The overall quality of the studies was satisfactory; several potential sources for bias were identified. Music therapy was generally provided as a single, 30'-intervention, ranging from 15 to 60'. Only in two studies was the intervention repeated more than once daily. The control groups were standard care, relaxation, headphones with no music or noise-cancelling headphones. Music therapy determined a significant reduction in the levels of anxiety and stress, as assessed by self-reported scales and physiologic parameters. Pooled analysis was not performed due to the heterogeneity of the interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant heterogeneity in trial designs, timing and features of the intervention, music therapy is consistently associated with a reduction in anxiety and stress of critically ill patients.},

METHODS:  Refugee children admitted to pediatric surgery department of a teaching hospital  during the years 2012-2017 were included. Patients' files were reviewed  retrospectively for sociodemographic and medical features. RESULTS: A total of  254 patients with the mean age of 4.6\,{\textpm}\,4.15~years (0-16~years) were treated.  Male-to-female ratio was 1.7. Most common diagnosis were inguino-scrotal  pathologies (n\,=\,50, 19.7\%) followed by foreign body ingestion (n\,=\,37, 14.6\%)  and corrosive esophagitis (n\,=\,22, 8.7\%). The cause of admission was a  potentially preventable trauma in 24.4\% of cases. Comorbid medical conditions  were present in 49 patients (19.3\%). Anemia was detected in 23.2\% of cases.  Weight according to age and gender were\,{$<$}\,3 percentile in 29.1\% of patients.  Difficulties in communication, lack of former medical history and advanced  presentation of disease were the challenges faced by caregivers. CONCLUSION: The  primary diagnoses for admission of refugee children were different from the  routine practice and a significant part were from preventable causes.  Comorbidities were common potentially having a negative influence on treatment  processes. This can be a result of unfavorable living conditions and lack of  medical care during migration.},

This study evaluated the optimal TXA dose for treating TBI using a network meta-analysis (NMA).                                         METHODS               Five databases were searched for peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from inception to May 2024. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) RCTs, (2) patients older than 1 month with TBI, (3) interventions of TXA and control, (4) primary outcomes of mortality and poor neurological outcomes and secondary outcomes of vascular occlusive events, and (5) full-text peer-reviewed articles. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. Frequency-based NMA was performed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation working-group approach.                                         RESULTS               We included 10 RCTs comprising 11,237 patients with TBI. Placebo showed higher mortality compared with that of a 2-g bolus of TXA (risk ratio, 1.53; 95\% confidence interval, 1.08--2.17). Higher mortality was observed with a 1-g bolus of TXA followed by 1-g maintenance TXA compared with that of a 2-g bolus of TXA (risk ratio, 1.44; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02--2.03). No significant differences in poor neurological outcomes or vascular occlusive events were observed between the treatment groups.                                         CONCLUSION               Placebo and a 1-g bolus followed by 1-g maintenance TXA were associated with higher mortality rates than those of a 2-g bolus of TXA. No difference in vascular occlusive events was observed with either treatment, indicating that our NMA recommends 2 g of TXA. However, the data for the 2-g bolus of TXA were from a single study, and further research is needed to draw definitive conclusions.

  abstract = {Ingested toothpicks are a relatively rare event, but they may cause serious gut injuries and can be listed among rare causes of perforation, peritonitis, sepsis  or death. Unless the foreign bodies were intentionally swallowed, many patients  who ingested them fail to remember the event and they do not refer it during the  medical history collection; this makes diagnosis problematic. In this work, a  case of perforation of the sigmoid colon is described, caused by a toothpick  ingestion. The patient had to be surgically treated because of a complication:  the formation of an entero-iliac fistula with subsequent development of a  pseudoaneurysm of the right external iliac artery. Vascular perforation due to  toothpick ingestion has rarely been reported. In similar cases, it could be  difficult to establishing the correct diagnosis because of the low sensitivity  and accuracy rates of diagnostic investigations. The ingestion of foreign bodies  should be kept in mind as an important differential diagnosis in patients with  acute abdomen or chronic abdominal pain of unknown origin.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES:: The purpose was to define which clinical conditions warrant delay of definitive fixation for pelvis, femur, acetabulum, and spine fractures. A model was developed to predict the complications. DESIGN:: Statistical modeling based on retrospective database. SETTING:: Level 1 trauma center. PATIENTS:: A total of 1443 adults with pelvis (n = 291), acetabulum (n = 399), spine (n = 102), and/or proximal or diaphyseal femur (n = 851) fractures. INTERVENTION:: All fractures were treated surgically. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS:: Univariate and multivariate analysis of variance assessed associations of parameters with complications. Logistic predictive models were developed with the incorporation of multiple fixed and random effect covariates. Odds ratios, F tests, and receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated. RESULTS:: Twelve percent had pulmonary complications, with 8.2\% overall developing pneumonia. The pH and base excess values were lower (P {$<$} 0.0001) and the rate of improvement was also slower (all Ps {$<$} 0.007), with pneumonia or any pulmonary complication. Similarly, lactate values were greater with pulmonary complications (all Ps {$<$} 0.02), and lactate was the most specific predictor of complications. Chest injury was the strongest independent predictor of pulmonary complication. Initial lactate was a stronger predictor of pneumonia (P = 0.0006) than initial pH (P = 0.047) or the rate of improvement of pH over the first 8 hours (P = 0.0007). An uncomplicated course was associated with the absence of chest injury (P {$<$} 0.0001) and definitive fixation within 24 (P = 0.007) or 48 hours (P = 0.005). Models were developed to predict probability of complications with various injury combinations using specific laboratory parameters measuring residual acidosis. CONCLUSIONS:: Acidosis on presentation is associated with complications. Correction of pH within 8 hours to {$>$}7.25 was associated with fewer pulmonary complications. Presence and severity of chest injury, number of fractures, and timing of fixation are other significant variables to include in a predictive model and algorithm development for Early Appropriate Care. The goal is to minimize complications by definitive management of major skeletal injury once the patient has been adequately resuscitated. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:: Prognostic Level II.

  abstract = {Rationale and aim: The purpose of this study is to acquire a better understanding of Food Foreign Bodies (FFB) injuries in children characterizing the risk of complications and prolonged hospitalization due to food items according to patients' characteristics, circumstances of the accident, Foreign Body (FB) features and FB location, as emerging from the SUSY Safe Web-Registry. Methods: The present study uses data provided by the SUSY Safe Project, a DG SANCO co-funded project started in February 2005, which was aimed at establishing an international registry of cases of Foreign Bodies (FB) injuries in children aged 0-14 years. The analysis was carried out on injuries due to a food item. FB location was reported according to ICD9-CM code: ears (ICD931). nose (ICD932), pharynx and larynx (ICD933) trachea, bronchi and lungs (ICD934), mouth, esophagus and stomach (ICD935). Age and gender injury distributions were assessed. Data regarding adult supervision and activity before injury were also evaluated. FBs which most frequently cause complications were identified. The association between children age, adult presence, object characteristics and hospitalization/complications was computed using unweighted odds ratios and the related 95\% confidence intervals. Results: 16,878 FB injuries occurred in children aged 0-14 years have been recorded in the SUSY Safe databases. FB type was specified in 10,564 cases; among them 2744(26\%) were due to a food item. FB site was recorded in 1344 cases: FB was located in the ears in 99 patients, while 1140 occurred in the upper and lower respiratory tract; finally, 105 food items were removed from mouth, esophagus and stomach. Complications occurred in 176 cases and the most documented was pulmonary or bronchial infections (23\%) followed emphysema or atelectasis and by and asthma (7\%). Bones were the commonest retrieved FFB encountered in this study, while nuts seem to be the FFB most frequently associated to complications. Conclusions: On the basis of this study we make the strong recommendation that parents should be adequately educated and provide age-appropriate food to their children and be present in order to supervise them during eating especially during a critical period ranging from 2 to 3 years of age.

Cannabinoid acids from hemp (Cannabis sativa) were found to be allosteric as well as orthosteric ligands with micromolar affinity for the spike protein. In follow-up virus neutralization assays, cannabigerolic acid and cannabidiolic acid prevented infection of human epithelial cells by a pseudovirus expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and prevented entry of live SARS-CoV-2 into cells. Importantly, cannabigerolic acid and cannabidiolic acid were equally effective against the SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant B.1.1.7 and the beta variant B.1.351. Orally bioavailable and with a long history of safe human use, these cannabinoids, isolated or in hemp extracts, have the potential to prevent as well as treat infection by SARS-CoV-2.},

  abstract = {To help researchers conduct a systematic review or meta-analysis as efficiently and transparently as possible, we designed a tool to accelerate the step of screening titles and abstracts. For many tasks---including but not limited to systematic reviews and meta-analyses---the scientific literature needs to be checked systematically. Scholars and practitioners currently screen thousands of studies by hand to determine which studies to include in their review or meta-analysis. This is error prone and inefficient because of extremely imbalanced data: only a fraction of the screened studies is relevant. The future of systematic reviewing will be an interaction with machine learning algorithms to deal with the enormous increase of available text. We therefore developed an open source machine learning-aided pipeline applying active learning: ASReview. We demonstrate by means of simulation studies that active learning can yield far more efficient reviewing than manual reviewing while providing high quality. Furthermore, we describe the options of the free and open source research software and present the results from user experience tests. We invite the community to contribute to open source projects such as our own that provide measurable and reproducible improvements over current practice.},

This systematic review assessed the success rate of antibiotics in the treatment of ACC.                                         Methods               A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library databases was performed. Primary outcomes were the need for emergency intervention and recurrence of ACC after initial non-operative management of ACC. Risk of bias was assessed. Pooled event rates were calculated using a random-effects model.                                         Results               Twelve randomized trials, four prospective and ten retrospective studies were included. Only one trial including 84 patients compared treatment with antibiotics to that with no antibiotics; there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of length of hospital stay and morbidity. Some 5830 patients with ACC were included, of whom 2997 had early cholecystectomy, 2791 received initial antibiotic treatment, and 42 were treated conservatively. Risk of bias was high in most studies, and all but three studies had a low level of evidence. For randomized studies, pooled event rates were 15 (95 per cent c.i. 10 to 22) per cent for the need for emergency intervention and 10 (5 to 20) per cent for recurrence of ACC. The pooled event rate for both outcomes combined was 20 (13 to 30) per cent.                                         Conclusion               Antibiotics are not indicated for the conservative management of ACC or in patients scheduled for cholecystectomy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In healthy volunteers, we investigated the ability of the pulse oximeter--derived peripheral perfusion index (PPI) to detect progressive reductions in central blood volume. METHODS: Twenty-five awake, spontaneously breathing, healthy male volunteers were subjected to progressive reductions in central blood volume by inducing stepwise lower body negative pressure (LBNP) with 20 mm Hg for 5 minutes per step, from 0 to -20, -40, -60, and back to 0 mm Hg. Throughout the procedure, stroke volume (SV), heart rate (HR), and mean arterial blood pressure were recorded using volume-clamp finger plethysmography. Assessment of the PPI was done by pulse oximetry. Additionally, the forearm-to-fingertip skin-temperature gradient was measured. Data are presented as mean {\textpm} SE. PPI underwent log transformation and is presented as median (25th--75th). RESULTS: Of the 25 subjects, one did not complete the study because of cardiovascular collapse. After the first LBNP step (-20 mm Hg), PPI decreased from 2.2 (1.6--3.3) to 1.2 (0.8--1.6) (P = 0.007) and SV decreased from 116 {\textpm} 3.0 mL to 104 {\textpm} 2.6 mL (P = 0.02). The magnitude of the PPI decrease (41\% {\textpm} 6.0\%) was statistically different from that observed for SV (9\% {\textpm} 1.3\%) and HR (3\% {\textpm} 1.9\%). During progression of LBNP, SV decreased and HR increased progressively with the increased applied negative pressure, whereas the PPI remained low throughout the remainder of the protocol and returned to baseline values when LBNP was released. At -60 mm Hg LBNP, SV decreased and HR increased by 36\% {\textpm} 0.9 \% and 33\% {\textpm} 2.4\% from baseline, respectively. Mean arterial blood pressure remained in the same range throughout the experiment. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the pulse oximeter--derived PPI may be a valuable adjunct diagnostic tool to detect early clinically significant central hypovolemia, before the onset of cardiovascular decompensation in healthy volunteers.{\enspace} (Anesth Analg 2013;116:351--6)},

  abstract = {Introduction: Emergency department thoracotomy is an established procedure for cardiac arrest in patients suffering from penetrating thoracic trauma and yields relatively high survival rates (up to 21\%) in patients with cardiac tamponade. To minimize the delay between arrest and thoracotomy, some have advocated thoracotomy on the accident scene. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of patients with return of spontaneous circulation and subsequent survival after out of hospital thoracotomy in the Netherlands. Methods: A retrospective analysis of data collected on all out of hospital thoracotomies performed in the Netherlands after penetrating trauma between April 1st, 2011 and September 30th, 2016 was performed. Data on patient characteristics, trauma mechanism and outcome were collected and analyzed. Primary outcome measure was return of spontaneous circulation after the intervention. Survival to hospital discharge was the secondary outcome variable. Results: Thirty-three prehospital emergency thoracotomies were performed. Ten patients (30\%) had gunshot wounds and 23 patients (70\%) had stab wounds. Nine patients (27\%) had return of spontaneous circulation and were presented to the hospital. Of these, one patient survived until discharge without neurological damage. Five died in the emergency department or operating room and three died in ICU. Conclusion: Return of spontaneous circulation after out of hospital thoracotomy for cardiac arrest due to penetrating thoracic injury is achievable, but a substantial number of patients die during the in hospital resuscitation phase. However, neurologic intact survival can be achieved.},

  abstract = {Introduction Paediatric traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) is a high acuity, low frequency event. Traditionally, survival from TCA has been reported as low, with some believing resuscitation is futile. Within the adult population, there is growing evidence to suggest that with early and aggressive correction of reversible causes, survival from TCA may be comparable with that seen from medical out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Key to this survival has been the adoption of a standardised approach to resuscitation. The aim of this study was, by a process of consensus, to develop an algorithm for the management of paediatric TCA for adoption in the UK. Methods A modified consensus development meeting of UK experts involved in the management of paediatric TCA was held. Statements discussed at the meeting were drawn from those that did not reach consensus (positive/negative) from a linked three-round online Delphi study. 19 statements relating to the diagnosis, management and futility of paediatric TCA were initially discussed in small groups before each participant anonymously recorded their agreement with the statement using 'yes', 'no' or 'don't know'. In keeping with our Delphi study, consensus was set a priori at 70\%. Statements reaching consensus were included in the proposed algorithm. Results 41 participants attended the meeting. Of the 19 statements discussed, 13 reached positive consensus and were included in the algorithm. A single statement regarding initial rescue breaths reached negative consensus and was excluded. Consensus was not reached for five statements, including the use of vasopressors and thoracotomy for haemorrhage control in blunt trauma. Conclusion In attempt to standardise our approach to the management of paediatric TCA and to improve outcomes, we present the first consensus-based algorithm specific to the paediatric population. While this algorithm was developed for adoption in the UK, it may be applicable to similar healthcare systems internationally.},

Defining which patients require care in a major trauma centre is a critical component of developing, evaluating and enhancing regional major trauma systems. Traditionally, trauma patients have been classified using the Injury Severity Score (ISS), but resource-b\- ased criteria have been proposed as an alternative. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between ISS and the use of life-\-saving interventions (LSI). Methods{\enspace} Retrospective cohort study using the Trauma Audit Research Network database for all adult patients (aged {$\geq$}18\,years) between 2006 and 2014. Patients were categorised as needing an LSI if they received one or more interventions from a previously defined list determined by expert consensus. Results{\enspace} 193\,290 patients met study inclusion criteria: 56.9\% male, median age 60.0 years (IQR 41.2--78.8) and median ISS 9 (IQR 9--16). The most common mechanism of injury was falls {$<$}2\,m (52.1\%), followed by road traffic collisions (22.2\%). 15.1\% received one or more LSIs. The probability of a receiving an LSI increased with increasing ISS, but only a low to moderate correlation was evident (0.334, p{$<$}0.001). A clinically significant number of cases (5.3\% and 7.6\%) received an LSI despite having an ISS {$\leq$}8\,or {$<$}15, respectively. Conclusions{\enspace} A clinically significant number of adult trauma patients requiring LSIs have an ISS below the traditional definition of major trauma. The traditional definition should be reconsidered and either lowered, or an alternative metric should be used.},

Physical examination was essentially unremarkable, and the abdomen  showed no signs of perforation peritonitis. X-rays of the abdomen showed multiple  'nail'-like radiopaque shadows in the abdominal cavity with no evidence of free  gas under the domes of the diaphragm. A non-operative expectant management was  pursued. The patient had passed all the sharps in stools without any complication  and was discharged after 12 days. After 3\,weeks, the patient presented with  non-bilious vomiting. Further investigations revealed pyloric stenosis with no  oesophageal luminal stenosis. To bypass the pyloric stenosis, a Billroth II  gastrojejunostomy was performed. The postoperative period was uneventful, and the  recovery was smooth.},

As the incidence of FBs requiring operative removal varies from 1\% to 14\%, it was decided to perform this study and compare the data with those from the world literature, as well as to outline an algorithm for management, including indications for surgery. We reviewed all patients with FB ingestion from 1973 to 1993. There were 542 patients with 1203 ingestions, aged 15 to 82 years. Among them, 69.9\% (n= 379) were jail inmates at the time of ingestion, 22.9\% (n= 124) had a history of psychosis, and 7.2\% (n= 39) were alcoholics or denture-wearing elderly subjects. Most foreign bodies passed spontaneously (75.6\%;n= 410). Endoscopic removal was possible in 19.5\% (n= 106) and was not associated with any morbidity. Only 4.8\% (n= 26) required surgery. Of the latter, 30.8\% (n= 8) had long gastric FBs with no tendency for distal passage and were removed via gastrotomy; 15.4\% (n= 4) had thin, sharp FBs, causing perforation; and 53.8\% (n= 14) had FBs impacted in the ileocecal region, which were removed via appendicostomy. Conservative approach to FB ingestion is justified, although early endoscopic removal from the stomach is recommended. In cases of failure, surgical removal for gastric FBs longer than 7.0 cm is wise. Thin, sharp FBs require a high index of suspicion because they carry a higher risk for perforation. The ileocecal region is the most common site of impaction. Removal of the FB via appendicostomy is the safest option and should not be delayed more than 48 hours.},

  abstract = {Background: Overuse of head computed tomography (CT) for syncope has been reported. However, there is no literature synthesis on this overuse. We undertook a systematic review to determine the use and yield of head CT and risk factors for serious intracranial conditions among syncope patients. Methods: We searched Embase, Medline, and Cochrane databases from inception until June 2017. Studies including adult syncope patients with part or all of patients undergoing CT head were included. We excluded case reports, reviews, letters, and pediatric studies. Two independent reviewers screened the articles and collected data on CT head use, diagnostic yield (proportion with acute hemorrhage, tumors or infarct), and risk of bias. We report pooled percentages, I2, and Cochran's Q-test. Results: Seventeen articles with 3,361 syncope patients were included. In eight ED studies (n = 1,669), 54.4\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 34.9\%--73.2\%) received head CT with a 3.8\% (95\% CI = 2.6\%--5.1\%) diagnostic yield and considerable heterogeneity. In six in-hospital studies (n = 1,289), 44.8\% (95\% CI = 26.4\%--64.1\%) received head CT with a 1.2\% (95\% CI = 0.5\%--2.2\%) yield and no heterogeneity. In two articles, all patients had CT (yield 2.3\%) and the third enrolled patients {$\geq$} 65 years old (yield 7.7\%). Abnormal neurologic findings, age {$\geq$} 65 years, trauma, warfarin use, and seizure/stroke history were identified as risk factors. The quality of all articles referenced was strong. Conclusion: More than half of patients with syncope underwent CT head with a diagnostic yield of 1.1\% to 3.8\%. A future large prospective study is needed to develop a robust risk tool.},

Previous reports, all retrospective in nature, have not identified any cases of CSI in either children or adults in the absence of neck pain, neurologic symptoms, distracting injury, or altered mental status. The objective of this study was to examine the incidence and spectrum of spine injury in patients who are younger than 18 years and to evaluate the efficacy of the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) decision instrument for obtaining cervical spine radiography in pediatric trauma victims. METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter study to evaluate pediatric blunt trauma victims. All patients who presented to participating emergency departments underwent clinical evaluation before radiographic imaging. The presence or absence of the following criteria was noted: midline cervical tenderness, altered level of alertness, evidence of intoxication, neurologic abnormality, and presence of painful distracting injury. Presence or absence of each individual criterion was documented for each patient before radiographic imaging, unless the patient was judged to be too unstable to complete the clinical evaluation before radiographs. The decision to radiograph a patient was entirely at the physician's discretion and not driven by the NEXUS questionnaire. The presence or absence of CSI was based on the final interpretation of all radiographic studies. Data on all patients who were younger than 18 years were sequestered from the main database for separate analysis. RESULTS: There were 3065 patients (9.0\% of all NEXUS patients) who were younger than 18 years in this cohort, 30 of whom (0.98\%) sustained a CSI. Included in the study were 88 children who were younger than 2, 817 who were between 2 and 8, and 2160 who were 8 to 17. Fractures of the lower cervical vertebrae (C5-C7) accounted for 45.9\% of pediatric CSIs. No case of spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality was reported in any child in this study, although 22 cases were reported in adults. Only 4 of the 30 injured children were younger than 9 years, and none was younger than 2 years. Tenderness and distracting injury were the 2 most common abnormalities noted in patients with and without CSI. The decision rule correctly identified all pediatric CSI victims (sensitivity: 100.0\%; 95\% confidence interval: 87.8\%-100.0\%) and correctly designated 603 patients as low risk for CSI (negative predictive value: 100.0\%; 95\% confidence interval: 99.4\%-100.0\%). CONCLUSIONS: The lower cervical spine is the most common site of CSI in children, and fractures are the most common type of injury. CSI is rare among patients aged 8 years or younger. The NEXUS decision instrument performed well in children, and its use could reduce pediatric cervical spine imaging by nearly 20\%. However, the small number of infants and toddlers in the study suggests caution in applying the NEXUS criteria to this particular age group.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: This report identifies a group of children in whom severe acute food bolus impaction (AFBI) was the leading symptom of gastroesophageal  reflux (GER) in the absence of stricture. METHODS: The esophageal structure and  function of 8 patients treated for AFBI requiring endoscopic removal of  alimentary foreign bodies in 6 of them (up to 4 times in 1 case) were  investigated by barium meal, esophagoscopy-biopsy, pH-metering, pull-through  stationary manometry, and 24-hour ambulatory manometry. The results were compared  with those in a group of age-matched regular refluxers (n = 14) without AFBI.  RESULTS: Six boys and 2 girls aged 108 +/- 59 months had impaction. Six children  had symptoms of GER like vomiting during infancy, heartburn, or respiratory tract  disease. Barium swallow ruled out stenosis in all patients and showed small  hiatal hernias in 3. All had endoscopic and histologic esophagitis (moderate to  severe in 6), and one had Schatzki ring. All but one (who had 8.45 mm Hg) had  normal lower esophageal sphincter pressure (16.2 +/- 4.7 mm Hg, mean +/- SD), and  all showed normal sphincteric relaxation. Esophageal body motility was not  significantly different from that in regular refluxers except in 6 children in  whom energetic distal peristalsis after reflux episodes could be seen  particularly during the night. Three of them had amazingly powerful distal waves  during the day and even stronger, simultaneous, wide and bizarre-shaped waves  during sleep. Symptoms improved in all cases after antireflux medication. Four  patients were cured after antireflux surgery. CONCLUSIONS: AFBI is a dramatic but  practically unheard of symptom of GER in children. It should be differentiated  from dysphagia and reveals motor dysfunction, sometimes severe, of the esophageal  body in the absence of sphincteric obstruction. Antireflux medication or surgery  were uniformly successful in our patients.},

Objectives: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of dynamic parameters used to predict fluid responsiveness in ventilated patients with a circulatory failure of any cause. Methods: In this multicenter prospective study, respiratory variations of superior vena cava diameter (ASVC) measured using transesophageal echocardiography, of inferior vena cava diameter (AIVC) measured using transthoracic echocardiography, of the maximal Doppler velocity in left ventricular outflow tract (AVmaxAo) measured using either approach, and pulse pressure variations (APP) were recorded with the patient in the semirecumbent position. In each patient, a passive leg raise was performed and an increase of aortic velocity time integral greater than or equal to 10\% defined fluid responsiveness. Measurements and Main Results: Among 540 patients (379 men; age, 65 {\textpm} 13 yr; Simplified Acute Physiological Score II, 59 {\textpm} 18; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, 10 {\textpm} 3), 229 exhibited fluid responsiveness (42\%). APP, AVmaxAo, ASVC, and AIVC could be measured in 78.5\%, 78.0\%, 99.6\%, and 78.1\% of cases, respectively. ASVC greater than or equal to 21\%, AVmaxAo greater than or equal to 10\%, and AIVC greater than or equal to 8\% had a sensitivity of 61\% (95\% confidence interval, 57-66\%), 79\% (75-83\%), and 55\% (50-59\%), respectively, and a specificity of 84\% (81-87\%), 64\% (59-69\%), and 70\% (66-75\%), respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of ASVC was significantly greater than that of AIVC (P = 0.02) and APP (P = 0.01). Conclusions: AVmaxAo had the best sensitivity and ASVC the best specificity in predicting fluid responsiveness. ASVC had a greater diagnostic accuracy than AIVC and APP, but its measurement requires transesophageal echocardiography.},

Design Prospective observational study conducted November 1999, with 2 components: a blood sampling study and an anemia and blood transfusion study. Setting and Patients The blood sampling study included 1136 patients from 145 western European ICUs, and the anemia and blood transfusion study included 3534 patients from 146 western European ICUs. Patients were followed up for 28 days or until hospital discharge, interinstitutional transfer, or death. Main Outcome Measures Frequency of blood drawing and associated volume of blood drawn, collected over a 24-hour period; hemoglobin levels, transfusion rate, organ dysfunction (assessed using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score), and mortality, collected throughout a 2-week period. Results The mean (SD) volume per blood draw was 10.3 (6.6) mL, with an average total volume of 41.1 (39.7) mL during the 24-hour period. There was a positive correlation between organ dysfunction and the number of blood draws (r=0.34; PϽ.001) and total volume drawn (r=0.28; PϽ.001). The mean hemoglobin concentration at ICU admission was 11.3 (2.3) g/dL, with 29\% (963/3295) having a concentration of less than 10 g/dL. The transfusion rate during the ICU period was 37.0\% (1307/3534). Older patients and those with a longer ICU length of stay were more commonly transfused. Both ICU and overall mortality rates were significantly higher in patients who had vs had not received a transfusion (ICU rates: 18.5\% vs 10.1\%, respectively; ␹2=50.1; PϽ.001; overall rates: 29.0\% vs 14.9\%, respectively; ␹2= 88.1; PϽ.001). For similar degrees of organ dysfunction, patients who had a transfusion had a higher mortality rate. For matched patients in the propensity analysis, the 28-day mortality was 22.7\% among patients with transfusions and 17.1\% among those without (P=.02); the KaplanMeier log-rank test confirmed this difference. Conclusions This multicenter observational study reveals the common occurrence of anemia and the large use of blood transfusion in critically ill patients. Additionally, this epidemiologic study provides evidence of an association between transfusions and diminished organ function as well as between transfusions and mortality.},

  abstract = {Background: Septic shock is the most severe form of sepsis, in which profound underlying abnormalities in circulatory and cellular/metabolic parameters lead to substantially increased mortality. A clear understanding and up-to-date assessment of the burden and epidemiology of septic shock are needed to help guide resource allocation and thus ultimately improve patient care. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was therefore to provide a recent evaluation of the frequency of septic shock in intensive care units (ICUs) and associated ICU and hospital mortality. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from 1 January 2005 to 20 February 2018 for observational studies that reported on the frequency and mortality of septic shock. Four reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved via consensus. Random effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate pooled frequency of septic shock diagnosed at admission and during the ICU stay and to estimate septic shock mortality in the ICU, hospital, and at 28 or 30 days. Results: The literature search identified 6291 records of which 71 articles met the inclusion criteria. The frequency of septic shock was estimated at 10.4\% (95\% CI 5.9 to 16.1\%) in studies reporting values for patients diagnosed at ICU admission and at 8.3\% (95\% CI 6.1 to 10.7\%) in studies reporting values for patients diagnosed at any time during the ICU stay. ICU mortality was 37.3\% (95\% CI 31.5 to 43.5\%), hospital mortality 39.0\% (95\% CI 34.4 to 43. 9\%), and 28-/30-day mortality 36.7\% (95\% CI 32.8 to 40.8\%). Significant between-study heterogeneity was observed. Conclusions: Our literature review reaffirms the continued common occurrence of septic shock and estimates a high mortality of around 38\%. The high level of heterogeneity observed in this review may be driven by variability in defining and applying the diagnostic criteria, as well as differences in treatment and care across settings and countries.},

There were no granulomas and no fissuring ulcers. This case highlights that an inflammatory mass in the small intestine caused by the perforation of ingested foreign body can mimic Crohn's disease.

Recurrent episodes were found in 4 pts.  DISCUSSION: Almost all episodes can be treated conservatively with observation  and endoscopy but the management of this pts has a financial impact on healthcare  cost and on security costs.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gastric pharmacobezoars are a rare entity that can induce mechanical gastric outlet obstructions and sometimes prolong toxic  pharmacological effects. Certain medications, such as sustained-release forms,  contain cellulose derivatives that may contribute to the adhesion between pills  and lead to the creation of an aggregate resulting in a pharmacobezoar. Case  reports are rare, and official guidelines are needed to help medical teams choose  proper treatment options. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 40-year-old  Caucasian woman with borderline personality disorder and active suicidal thoughts  who was found unconscious after a massive drug consumption of slow-release  clomipramine, lorazepam, and domperidone. On her arrival in the emergency room,  endotracheal intubation was preformed to protect her airway, and a chest x-ray  revealed multiple coffee grain-sized opaque masses in the stomach. She was  treated with activated charcoal followed by two endoscopic gastric  decontaminations 12\,h apart in order to extract a massive gastric pharmacobezoar  by manual removal of the tablets. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates that in the  case of a massive drug consumption, a pharmacobezoar should be suspected,  particularly when cellulose-coated pills are ingested. Severe poisoning due to  delayed drug release from the gastric aggregate is a potential complication.  Detection by x-ray is crucial, and treatment is centered on removal of the  aggregate. The technique of decontamination varies among experts, and no formal  recommendations exist to date. It seems reasonable that endoscopic evaluation  should be performed in order to determine the appropriate technique of  decontamination. Care should be patient-oriented and take into account the  clinical presentation and any organ failure, and it should not be determined  solely by the suspected medication ingested. Thus, serum levels are not  sufficient to guide management of tricyclic antidepressant intoxication.},

Coins that are in the esophagus and are causing  symptoms (cough, stridor, respiratory distress, drooling or pain) are managed  with immediate removal via various methods. Asymptomatic coins have been a  perplexing problem to the clinician for decades, with some advocating for  immediate removal while others are proponents of "watchful waiting". RECENT  FINDINGS: This article will provide a review of the current literature on  management options for symptomatic and asymptomatic esophageal coins. The article  will discuss clinical decision-making strategies for the diagnosis of the  unwitnessed ingestion, as well as diagnostic studies, such as plain radiographs,  as well as novel modalities, such as metal detectors. Discussion of the anatomic  issues related to esophageal foreign bodies will be addressed. Treatment options  for asymptomatic patients will be reviewed utilizing data from retrospective  studies as well as a prospective randomized trial. SUMMARY: In the symptomatic  patient with an esophageal coin, immediate removal via endoscopy is recommended.  For the asymptomatic patient with an esophageal coin, current data support  expectant management for a period of 12-24 h with the hope of spontaneous passage  and avoidance of general anesthesia and surgical procedure.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe the incidence and management of gastrointestinal tract Buckyball magnets ingestions in a multicenter Chinese pediatric patient  population, and discuss the preventive measures. METHODS: Medical records of 74  pediatric patients from 9 large Chinese hospitals during the past 10\,years, who  were diagnosed as buckyball magnets ingestion and got invasive treatment, were  retrospectively studied. The follow-up was through telephone and outpatient  service to estimate the post-surgery condition. Information collection was  through online questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the 74 cases, there were 50 boys  (68\%) and 24 girls (32\%). The median age was 36 (interquartile range (IQR) 22-77)  months, with a range of 7\,months to 11\,years, and it showed two peaks, the first  between 1 and 3\,years, and the second between 6 to 11\,years. The annual case  number showed a sharp increase over time, and the total case number in the last  2\,years (2017 and 2018) showed a greater than 9-fold increase when compared with  the first 2\,years (2013 and 2014). The majority of ingestions were unintentional,  with only 3 patients deliberately swallowing the Buckyball magnets. The median  time of ingestion until the onset of emergent symptoms was 2 (IQR 1-5) days, and  ranged from 4\,h to 40\,days. Twenty-one patients had no symptoms, and the  remaining cases presented with abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, abdominal  distension, excessive crying, melena, and the ceasing of flatus and defecation.  Gastroscopy, colonoscopy, laparoscopic surgery and laparotomy surgery were  performed in accordance with the algorithm from the North American Society of  Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN). Procedural and  operative findings included gastrointestinal mucosa erosion, ischemia and  necrosis, perforation, and abdominal abscess, fistula and intestinal obstruction.  The median number of Buckyball magnets ingested was 4 (IQR 2-8), with a range  from 1 to 39. During the median follow-up period of 6 (IQR 1-15) months, 3  patients had intestinal obstruction, and one underwent a second operation. The  remaining 71 patients courses were uneventful during the follow-up period. None  of the 74 patients reported a second swallowing of foreign bodies. CONCLUSIONS:  The incidence of pediatric gastrointestinal tract magnets ingestion in China is  increasing. Management of such patients should follow the NASPGHAN algorithm.  Preventive measures to limit children's access to Buckyball magnets should be  taken from three levels, namely the national administration, producer, and  consumer.},

However, there may be difficulty locating FBs and complications associated with their removal. This study aimed to identify risk factors and complications correlated to the presence and removal of FBs. Methods This 5-year retrospective study enrolled 1,311 patients between June 2014 and April 2019. Demographic and endoscopic data were collected, containing age, gender, types and location of FBs, duration of FB ingestion, accessory devices, endoscopic methods, and complications. Logistic regression analysis was applied to evaluate the predictive risk factors. Results Among 1,131 patients, FBs were found in 90.16\% of cases. A major predictor for the presence of FB was a presentation of less than 24 hours (h). The types of FBs were jujube pits (36.72\%) and fish bones (22.00\%), and over 80\% of the FBs were discovered in the esophagus. Complications were found in 239 cases (20.22\%), of which hemorrhage (162/239, 67.78\%) was the most frequent. Age {$\geq$}60, duration {$\geq$}24 h, and FBs ingested in the esophagus were considered as risk factors for developing complications. Conclusions In conclusion, the longer duration, age {$\geq$}60, and impaction in the esophagus were risk factors for developing complications following the ingestion of FBs. These factors should be considered when developing assessment and treatment plans in the management of FB ingestion.},

However, different dosing periods of epinephrine have not been systematically assessed. Objective---We evaluated the association between epinephrine dosing frequency and survival to hospital discharge in adults with an in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Methods---Using data from 2000--2009 in the Get With the Guidelines(GWTG)-Resuscitation IHCA registry (formerly the National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation [NRCPR]), we examined the association between epinephrine dosing period and survival to hospital discharge. Epinephrine dosing period was defined as the time between the first epinephrine dose and the resuscitation endpoint, divided by the total number of epinephrine doses received subsequent to the first epinephrine dose. Generalized estimating equations were used to construct multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for patient and arrest characteristics. Results---Included were 20,909 eligible IHCA events from 505 GWTG-Resuscitation participating hospitals. Compared to an epinephrine dosing period of 4 to {$<$}5 minutes per dose, survival to hospital discharge was significantly higher in patients with an epinephrine dosing period of 6 to {$<$}10 minutes per dose: for 6 to {$<$}7 min/dose, adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.41 (95\% CI: 1.12, 1.78); for 7 to {$<$}8 min/dose, adjusted OR, 1.30 (95\%CI: 1.02, 1.65); for 8 to {$<$}9 min/dose, adjusted OR, 1.79 (95\%CI: 1.38, 2.32); for 9 to {$<$}10 min/dose, adjusted OR, 2.17 (95\%CI: 1.62, 2.92). This pattern was consistent for both shockable and non-shockable cardiac arrest rhythms. Moreover, for the majority (87\%) of cardiac arrests due to non-shockable rhythms, an epinephrine dosing period of 1 to {$<$}3 minutes/dose was associated with lower rates of survival. Conclusion---In this large, observational, national registry of in-hospital cardiac arrest, we found that epinephrine dosing at a less frequent dosing period than recommended by consensus guidelines was associated with improved survival of in-hospital cardiac arrest. Our findings suggest that clinical trials may be needed to determine the role and dose frequency of epinephrine in the treatment of in-hospital cardiac arrest.},

Two hundred thirty-nine foreign bodies (98.8\%) were successfully managed endoscopically. The surgery rate was 0.4\%. There was no morbidity or mortality. Twenty-five percent of the cases were done under general endotracheal anesthesia. Coins in the esophagus are removed promptly if in the cervical or mid esophagus, and within 12 hours if in the distal esophagus. Once in the stomach, they will usually pass without difficulty. Meat impaction resulting in an obstructed esophagus is an urgent problem and the bolus should be removed within hours. Sharp and pointed foreign bodies can be very difficult to manage. Dry runs with a reproduction of the foreign body are essential to successful removal. Button batteries lodged in the esophagus represent an emergency and should be removed without delay. Once in the stomach, they will usually pass through the gastrointestinal tract without difficulty. The forward-viewing flexible panendoscope has become the instrument of choice in managing foreign bodies in most tertiary medical centers as well as in the community hospitals.},

Patients with esophageal foreign bodies were not included in the study group. A 10-year experience is reported. Each patient's physical examination findings at presentation, white blood cell count, length of hospital stay, number and types of foreign bodies ingested, endoscopic interventions, surgical interventions, and complications were reviewed. There were 75 separate hospitalizations, all occurring in 22 male prison inmates. A total of 256 foreign bodies were ingested. Patients incurred 281 hospitalization days (average 3.7 days per admission). One patient had signs of peritonitis. White blood cell count was less than 10 K/{$\mu$}L in 85\%. Sixty-four endoscopies were performed with removal of 79 of 163 foreign bodies (48\% success rate). Five patients required general anesthesia because of a lack of cooperation. Complications occurred in four of them, one requiring laparotomy. Eight additional laparotomies were performed. One was performed for an acute abdomen on admission and one for the development of an acute abdomen after conservative management. Two were performed to remove metal bezoars. Four additional laparotomies were performed because of surgeon preference. Among the 23 patients admitted and managed conservatively, 77 (97\%) of 79 foreign bodies passed spontaneously. One patient required laparotomy. Of the 256 ingested foreign bodies, 79 were removed endoscopically, 71 were removed surgically, and 106 passed spontaneously. The size, shape, and number were not predictive of the ability to transit the gastrointestinal tract. Foreign body ingestion is problematic in prison inmates. With conservative management, most foreign bodies will pass spontaneously. Endoscopy has a high failure rate and is associated with significant complications. Surgical intervention should be reserved for those who have acute conditions in the abdomen or large bezoars. ( J Gastrointest Surg 2002; 6:496--500.)},

Previous trials and meta-analyses have led to different conclusions on whether a high fraction of supplemental inspired oxygen during anaesthesia may decrease or increase mortality and surgical site infections in surgical patients. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of an FIO 2  equal to or greater than 60\% compared with a control FIO 2  at or below 40\% in the perioperative setting in terms of mortality, surgical site infection, respiratory insufficiency, serious adverse events and length of stay during the index admission for adult surgical patients. We looked at various outcomes, conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses, examined the role of bias and applied trial sequential analysis (TSA) to examine the level of evidence supporting or refuting a high FIO 2  during surgery, anaesthesia and recovery. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, International Web of Science, the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), advanced Google and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) up to February 2014. We checked the references of included trials and reviews for unidentified relevant trials and reran the searches in March 2015. We will consider two studies of interest when we update the review. Selection criteria We included randomized clinical trials that compared a high fraction of inspired oxygen with a routine fraction of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia, surgery and recovery in individuals 18 years of age or older. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data independently. We conducted random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses, and for dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs). We used published data and data obtained by contacting trial authors. To minimize the risk of systematic error, we assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. To reduce the risk of random errors caused by sparse data and repetitive updating of cumulative meta-analyses, we applied trial sequential analyses. We used Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results We included 28 randomized clinical trials (9330 participants); in the 21 trials reporting relevant outcomes for this review, 7597 participants were randomly assigned to a high fraction of inspired oxygen versus a routine fraction of inspired oxygen. In trials with an overall low risk of bias, a high fraction of inspired oxygen compared with a routine fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with all-cause mortality (random-effects model: RR 1.12, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.36; GRADE: low quality) within the longest follow-up and within 30 days of follow-up (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.99, 95\% CI 0.61 to 1.60; GRADE: low quality). In a trial sequential analysis, the required information size was not reached and the analysis could not refute a 20\% increase in mortality. Similarly, when all trials were included, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with all{\dbend}{\dbend}{\dbend}cause mortality to the longest follow-up (RR 1.07, 95\% CI 0.87 to 1.33) or within 30 days of follow-up (Peto OR 0.83, 95\% CI 0.54 to 1.29), both of very low quality according to GRADE. Neither was a high fraction of inspired oxygen associated with the risk of surgical site infection in trials with low risk of bias (RR 0.86, 95\% CI 0.63 to 1.17; GRADE: low quality) or in all trials (RR 0.87, 95\% CI 0.71 to 1.07; GRADE: low quality). A high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with respiratory insufficiency (RR 1.25, 95\% CI 0.79 to 1.99), serious adverse events (RR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.65 to 1.43) or length of stay (mean difference -0.06 days, 95\% CI -0.44 to 0.32 days). In subgroup analyses of nine trials using preoperative antibiotics, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was associated with a decrease in surgical site infections (RR 0.76, 95\% CI 0.60 to 0.97; GRADE: very low quality); a similar effect was noted in the five trials adequately blinded for the outcome assessment (RR 0.79, 95\% CI 0.66 to 0.96; GRADE: very low quality). We did not observe an effect of a high fraction of inspired oxygen on surgical site infections in any other subgroup analyses. Authors' conclusions As the risk of adverse events, including mortality, may be increased by a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60\% or higher, and as robust evidence is lacking for a beneficial effect of a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60\% or higher on surgical site infection, our overall results suggest that evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of a high fraction of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia and surgery. Given the risk of attrition and outcome reporting bias, as well as other weaknesses in the available evidence, further randomized clinical trials with low risk of bias in all bias domains, including a large sample size and long-term follow-up, are warranted. Plain language summary The effects of giving adult patients a high inspiratory oxygen fraction around the time of surgery Review question The normal air that we breathe contains 21\% oxygen. This systematic review assesses the beneficial and harmful effects of a percentage of inspired oxygen of 60\% to 90\% compared with a routine percentage of 30\% to 40\% given during anaesthesia, during surgery and in the immediate recovery period on the numbers of deaths and surgical site infections reported in adult surgical patients. Background Reduced lung and circulatory function during surgery can lead to reduced levels of oxygen (hypoxia). Also, oxygen levels are often low in wounds at the end of surgery. This may impair bacterial killing and wound healing. Trials and previous meta-analyses have led to different conclusions as to whether a high percentage of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia may decrease or increase the risk of death or surgical site infections. This systematic review used improved Cochrane methodology for carrying out systematic reviews to reassess available evidence derived from randomized clinical trials. Study characteristics We identified 28 randomized clinical trials. Eight trials with 4918 participants reported on risk of death, and 15 trials with 7219 participants reported on surgical site infections within 14 to 30 days of surgery. Four trials reported serious adverse events, three trials respiratory insufficiency, nine trials length of stay during the associated hospital admission and one trial quality of life. All trials were conducted without direct industry funding. The number of participants in each trial ranged from 38 to 2012. The mean age of participants was 50 years (range 15 to 92 years) and 63\% were women. Types of surgery included abdominal surgery (eight trials), caesarean section (four trials), breast surgery (one trial), orthopaedic surgery (two trials) and various other surgical procedures (four trials). Key results A high percentage of inspired oxygen was not statistically associated with increased risk of death, or with a decrease in surgical site infections, in all trials that measured these outcomes, in trials of highest quality and in those with longest follow-up. An increased risk of adverse events could not be proved right or wrong for a high percentage of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia and surgery. Quality and quantity of the evidence Only five of the included trials had low risk of bias. The trials randomly assigned 9330 participants, of whom only 7537 participants provided data for this review. The number of participants required to detect or reject a 20\% relative risk reduction in deaths was not reached; therefore the observed results were uncertain.},

This study aims to evaluate a management protocol where endoscopic examination  was only selectively used after routine direct laryngoscopy to minimize patient  discomfort and the need for general anesthesia in children. METHOD: A management  protocol for foreign body ingestion based on symptoms was introduced in 1998 and  records of children admitted to a university-affiliated hospital between January  1999 and October 2005 with suspected foreign body ingestion were evaluated.  Symptoms, radiologic and endoscopic findings, and outcome were reviewed. RESULTS:  A total of 282 patients were admitted. The mean age of patients was 5.75 years  (range, 9 months to 17 years). There were 167 boys and 115 girls. Based on our  protocol, 84 (29.8\%) patients required an upper endoscopy. Fish bones were most  commonly involved (68.8\%). Foreign bodies, which were either removed or  dislodged, were found during upper endoscopy in only 25 (8.8\%) patients overall.  All patients had an uneventful outcome. No complications or mortalities were  encountered. There were no readmissions for those who did not undergo endoscopic  examination. CONCLUSION: It is safe to selectively perform upper endoscopy  depending on symptoms when managing children with foreign body ingestion.},

  abstract = {Background: Prehospital research has found little evidence in support of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, these studies generally examine city-based emergency medical services (EMS) systems. The training and experience of ACLS-skilled paramedics differs internationally, and this may also contribute to negative findings. Additionally, the frequency of negative outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest suggests that it is difficult to establish sufficient numbers to detect an effect. Purpose: To examine the effect of ACLS on cardiac arrest in Queensland, Australia. Queensland has a population of 3.8 million and an area of over 1.7 million km2, and is served by a statewide EMS system, which deploys resources using a two-tier model. Advanced treatments such as intubation and cardioactive drug administration are provided by extensively trained intensive care paramedics. Methods: An observational, retrospective design was used to examine all cases of cardiac arrest attended by the Queensland Ambulance Service from January 2000 to December 2002. Logistic regression was used to examine the effect of the presence of an intensive care paramedic on survival to hospital discharge, adjusting for age, sex, initial rhythm, the presence of a witness and bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Results: The presence of an intensive care paramedic had a significant effect on survival (OR = 1.43, 95\% CI = 1.02 to 1.99). Conclusions: Highly trained ACLS-skilled paramedics provide added survival benefit in EMS systems not optimised for early defibrillation. The reasons for this benefit are multifactorial, but may be the result of greater skill level and more informed use of the full range of prehospital interventions.},

  abstract = {I.V. fluid therapy does not result in the extracellular volume distribution expected from Starling's original model of semi-permeable capillaries subject to hydrostatic and oncotic pressure gradients within the extracellular fluid. Fluid therapy to support the circulation relies on applying a physiological paradigm that better explains clinical and research observations. The revised Starling equation based on recent research considers the contributions of the endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL), the endothelial basement membrane, and the extracellular matrix. The characteristics of capillaries in various tissues are reviewed and some clinical corollaries considered. The oncotic pressure difference across the EGL opposes, but does not reverse, the filtration rate (the `no absorption' rule) and is an important feature of the revised paradigm and highlights the limitations of attempting to prevent or treat oedema by transfusing colloids. Filtered fluid returns to the circulation as lymph. The EGL excludes larger molecules and occupies a substantial volume of the intravascular space and therefore requires a new interpretation of dilution studies of blood volume and the speculation that protection or restoration of the EGL might be an important therapeutic goal. An explanation for the phenomenon of context sensitivity of fluid volume kinetics is offered, and the proposal that crystalloid resuscitation from low capillary pressures is rational. Any potential advantage of plasma or plasma substitutes over crystalloids for volume expansion only manifests itself at higher capillary pressures.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             The Trauma Hemostasis and Oxygenation Research (THOR) Network has developed a consensus statement on the role of permissive hypotension in remote damage control resuscitation (RDCR). A summary of the evidence on permissive hypotension follows the THOR Network position on the topic. In RDCR, the burden of time in the care of the patients suffering from noncompressible hemorrhage affects outcomes. Despite the lack of published evidence, and based on clinical experience and expertise, it is the THOR Network's opinion that the increase in prehospital time leads to an increased burden of shock, which poses a greater risk to the patient than the risk of rebleeding due to slightly increased blood pressure, especially when blood products are available as part of prehospital resuscitation.             The THOR Network's consensus statement is, ``In a casualty with life-threatening hemorrhage, shock should be reversed as soon as possible using a blood-based HR fluid. Whole blood is preferred to blood components. As a part of this HR, the initial systolic blood pressure target should be 100 mm Hg. In RDCR, it is vital for higher echelon care providers to receive a casualty with sufficient physiologic reserve to survive definitive surgical hemostasis and aggressive resuscitation. The combined use of blood-based resuscitation and limiting systolic blood pressure is believed to be effective in promoting hemostasis and reversing shock''},

  abstract = {The Trauma Hemostasis and Oxygenation Research (THOR) Network has developed a consensus statement on the role of permissive hypotension in remote damage control resuscitation (RDCR). A summary of the evidence on permissive hypotension follows the THOR Network position on the topic. In RDCR, the burden of time in the care of the patients suffering from noncompressible hemorrhage affects outcomes. Despite the lack of published evidence, and based on clinical experience and expertise, it is the THOR Network's opinion that the increase in prehospital time leads to an increased burden of shock, which poses a greater risk to the patient than the risk of rebleeding due to slightly increased blood pressure, especially when blood products are available as part of prehospital resuscitation.The THOR Network's consensus statement is, "In a casualty with life-threatening hemorrhage, shock should be reversed as soon as possible using a blood-based HR fluid. Whole blood is preferred to blood components. As a part of this HR, the initial systolic blood pressure target should be 100 mm Hg. In RDCR, it is vital for higher echelon care providers to receive a casualty with sufficient physiologic reserve to survive definitive surgical hemostasis and aggressive resuscitation. The combined use of blood-based resuscitation and limiting systolic blood pressure is believed to be effective in promoting hemostasis and reversing shock".},

  abstract = {Introduction: Intentional foreign body ingestion represents a challenge to treat for emergency room physicians, endoscopists, and psychiatrists alike. Time from ingestion and composition of the ingested object are often unclear on initial presentation, making it difficult for endoscopists to determine the optimal timing for attempting procedural removal. Fortunately, over 80 percent of these ingested foreign bodies pass without the need for endoscopic intervention. We present a case, however, where emergent collaborative endoscopic intervention was needed. Case Description/Methods: A 29-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder presented following purposeful ingestion of a foreign body. The patient was in a cemetery when he experienced auditory hallucinations instructing him to swallow his crucifix necklace. Following ingestion, the patient immediately experienced drooling, coughing, and dysphagia. Despite his attempts to selfexpel the crucifix, it remained lodged. On arrival to the emergency department, the patient was intubated for airway protection. Initial laboratory findings were unremarkable except for a urine drug screen that was positive for amphetamines. Initially, the gastroenterology team was consulted, and EGD was pursued. An Olympus endoscope was inserted into the mouth and advanced under direct visualization to the upper esophageal sphincter where a metallic tip was seen. Rat tooth forceps were used to attempt to grasp the metallic object but resistance was met, and the procedure was aborted. Otolaryngology was then consulted and performed a direct laryngoscopy using a Lindholm laryngoscope. Evaluation showed that the distal aspect of the cross was down into the cervical esophagus while the right aspect of the cross was in the patient's hypopharynx. The otolaryngology team was able to use a grasper to grab the clasp of the cross with successful removal. Following the procedure, the patient was safely extubated and eventually was eventually transferred to an inpatient psychiatric hospital. Discussion: This case highlights the importance of a multi-specialty approach to purposeful foreign body ingestion. Flexible endoscopy has become the instrument of choice in managing foreign bodies and, with the advent of retrieval devices, it has led to more than a 90 percent success rate of retrieval. Our case highlights that even when unsuccessful the importance of working alongside our otolaryngology colleagues can ensure safe outcomes.},

However, some patients with esophageal foreign body ingestion do not come to the hospital immediately and may delay medical intervention from the time of ingestion. The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of adults with suspected esophageal foreign body ingestion according to the time of ingestion and types of foreign bodies. A total of 326 adult patients (151 men and 175 women) were analyzed, and divided into two groups according to the time period: within or beyond 24 hours from ingestion to endoscopic intervention. A total of 172 patients (52.7\%) were found to have ingested foreign bodies; 73.5\% were removed smoothly, 10.3\% were treated by push technique and 16.0\% with failed retrieval received alternative treatments. A higher proportion of patients in the beyond-24 hours group suffered from odynophagia (25.9 vs. 12.9\%, P {$<$} 0.05). Negative identification of esophageal foreign bodies was more frequent in the beyond-24 hours group (67 vs. 40.2\%, P {$<$} 0.05), but these patients showed higher proportions of esophageal ulcers (21.1 vs. 7.2\%, P {$<$} 0.05). The beyond-24 hours group also showed a significantly higher rate of foreign bodies in the lower esophagus (40.0 vs. 15.3\%, P {$<$} 0.05). Patients with esophageal food bolus impaction had significant delayed endoscopic intervention, longer therapeutic endoscopic time, higher proportions of esophageal cancer, stricture and fewer complications. Endoscopic intervention within 24 hours from the time of ingestion should be considered early in adults, because delaying intervention may produce more symptomatic esophageal ulcerations with odynophagia.},

PURPOSE: To evaluate the  potential value of computed tomography (CT) in guiding the selection of surgical  treatment for patients with ingested foreign bodies in the lower gastrointestinal  tract. METHODS: Between January 2014 and December 2023, we analyzed the data of  58 patients (median age: 65.4~years; range, 31-96~years) with ingested foreign  bodies in the lower gastrointestinal tract who underwent CT examinations.  Patients were treated either conservatively (35 cases) or surgically (23 cases).  The angle between the long axis of the foreign body and the intestinal canal  (FB-IC angle) was measured. CT findings and clinical variables were evaluated to  identify potential indicators for surgical treatment through univariate and  multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed  the FB-IC angle (P\,=\,0.002), presence of free peritoneal gas (P\,=\,0.002), white  blood cell count (P\,=\,0.018), and neutrophil count (P\,=\,0.007) as significant  factors associated with surgical treatment. Multivariate analysis demonstrated  that the FB-IC angle (odds ratio, 1.033; P\,=\,0.045) and the presence of free  peritoneal gas (odds ratio, 41.335; P\,=\,0.002) are independent indicators for  surgical management. The FB-IC angle showed an area under the receiver operating  characteristic curve of 0.755, with a cutoff value of 51.25 degrees. CONCLUSION:  The FB-IC angle and presence of free peritoneal gas serve as potential predictive  imaging markers for surgical intervention.},

  abstract = {To determine whether an epinephrine-induced early increase in arterial lactate concentration can prognosticate the outcome during shock state, we conducted a retrospective study in a 16-bed medical intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in France. One hundred consecutive patients admitted because of a shock state irrespective of etiology and treated with epinephrine were included. Patients were not enrolled if they received epinephrine administration before intensive care unit admission. Sequential arterial lactate measurements were performed at the time of epinephrine infusion (H0) and 4 h later (H4) in which \$lactate was defined as (100 {\^A} [arterial lactateH4 j arterial lactateH0]/arterial lactateH0) and expressed as a percentage. Etiology of shock was septic (82\%), cardiogenic (10\%), or hemorrhagic (8\%). Twenty-eightYday mortality rate was 72\%. At admission, arterial lactate concentration was elevated (4.96 T 3.8 mmol/L) and was further increased upon epinephrine administration, reaching a peak at H4 (8.22 T 3.66). When patients were stratified according to their outcome, nonsurvivors displayed the same pattern as survivors, although with a significant upward shift in values (ANOVA, P = 0.0003). The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and \$lactate were the only variables associated with the 28-day risk of death, with an odds ratio of 1.32 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.06Y1.65; P = 0.01) and 0.99 (95\% CI, 0.99Y0.99; P = 0.03), respectively, in multivariate analysis. At a value of 100\%, \$lactate predicted death, with a 71\% sensitivity (95\% CI, 51\%Y87\%) and a 67\% specificity (95\% CI, 43\%Y85\%). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis confirmed this finding, with a 52.4\% death rate among patients with \$lactate greater than 100 comparatively to 84.7\% when \$lactate was less than 100 (log-rank test, P = 0.0002). An adapted response (lactate production) to a pharmacological trigger (epinephrine) is associated with better prognosis during shock of various etiologies.},

Repeated concussions are thought to lead to long-term brain damage including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). With the worldwide growing interest in studying sport-related concussion the search for biomarkers for early diagnosis and progression of neuronal injury has also became priority. MicroRNAs are short, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. Due to their high stability in biological fluids, microRNAs can serve as biomarkers in a variety of diseases including pathologies of the nervous system. In this exploratory study, we have evaluated changes in the expression of selected serum miRNAs in collegiate football players obtained during a full practice and game season. We found a miRNA signature that can distinguish with good specificity and sensitivity players with concussions from non-concussed players. Furthermore, we found miRNAs associated with the acute phase (let-7c-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-181c-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-154-5p, miR-431-5p, miR-151a-5p, miR-181d-5p, miR-487b-3p, miR-377-3p, miR-17-5p, miR-22-3p, and miR-126-5p) and those whose changes persist up to four months after concussion (miR-17-5p and miR-22-3p).},

Patients and Methods: We report the case of a 67-year-old man with diffuse swelling of the cheek and the discharge of pus from the parotid duct orifice caused by a fish bone that had penetrated into the parotid duct. The preoperative examination using ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a linear foreign body. Results: The fish bone was thought to be embedded deeply in the parotid duct; therefore, we used a combined approach (endoscopy with open surgery), because we anticipated difficulties with endoscopic removal of the fish bone. The endoscopic view showed that the fish bone had partially penetrated the soft tissue in the parotid duct wall, but the fish bone could not be removed endoscopically. With endoscopic assistance, the impacted fish bone was removed using an intraoral surgical approach. The clinical outcome was satisfactory during a 10-month follow-up period, with no evidence of complications. Conclusions: The combined surgical and endoscopic approach resulted in the safe and effective removal of a foreign body from the salivary duct that could not be removed using sialendoscopy alone.

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Most patients with oesophageal and gastro-oesophageal carcinoma are diagnosed at an advanced stage and require palliative intervention. Although there are many kinds of interventions, the optimal one for the palliation of dysphagia remains unclear. This review updates the previous version published in 2009. Objectives The aim of this review was to systematically analyse and summarise the efficacy of different interventions used in the palliation of dysphagia in primary oesophageal and gastro-oesophageal carcinoma. Search methods To find new studies for this updated review, in January 2014 we searched, according to the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases model, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library ), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL; and major conference proceedings (up to January 2014).   Selection criteria Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in which patients with inoperable or unresectable primary oesophageal cancer underwent palliative treatment. Different interventions like rigid plastic intubation, self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) insertion, brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy, chemotherapy, oesophageal bypass surgery, chemical and thermal ablation therapy, either head-to-head or in combination, were included. The primary outcome was dysphagia improvement. Secondary outcomes included recurrent dysphagia, technical success, procedure related mortality, 30-day mortality, adverse effects and quality of life. Data collection and analysis Data collection and analysis were performed in accordance with the methods of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Review Group. Main results We included 3684 patients from 53 studies. SEMS insertion was safer and more effective than plastic tube insertion. Thermal and chemical ablative therapy provided comparable dysphagia palliation but had an increased requirement for re-interventions and for adverse effects. Anti-reflux stents provided comparable dysphagia palliation to conventional metal stents. Some anti-reflux stents might have reduced gastro-oesophageal reflux and complications. Newly-designed double-layered nitinol (Niti-S) stents were preferable due to longer survival time and fewer complications compared to simple Niti-S stents. Brachytherapy might be a suitable alternative to SEMS in providing a survival advantage and possibly a better quality of life, and might provide better results when combined with argon plasma coagulation or external beam radiation therapy. Authors' conclusions Self-expanding metal stent insertion is safe, effective and quicker in palliating dysphagia compared to other modalities. However, high-dose intraluminal brachytherapy is a suitable alternative and might provide additional survival benefit with a better quality of life. Some anti-reflux stents and newly-designed stents lead to longer survival and fewer complications compared to conventional stents. Combinations of brachytherapy with self-expanding metal stent insertion or radiotherapy are preferable due to the reduced requirement for re-interventions. Rigid plastic tube insertion, dilatation alone or in combination with other modalities, and chemotherapy alone are not recommended for palliation of dysphagia due to a high incidence of delayed complications and recurrent dysphagia. Plain language summary Interventions for reducing difficulty in swallowing in people with oesophageal cancer Review question For most patients with unresectable or inoperable oesophageal cancer, providing clinical benefit with palliative treatment is highly desirable. However, the optimal palliative technique for dysphagia improvement and better quality of life is not established. Background Dysphagia (difficulty or discomfort in swallowing) is common among patients with unresectable or inoperable oesophageal cancer. There are five levels of dysphagia, ranging from the ability to eat a normal diet to some solids, semisolids, liquids and to complete dysphagia. Study characteristics The review included randomised controlled studies comparing the use of different interventions to improve dysphagia among patients with inoperable or unresectable primary oesophageal cancer. To find new studies for this updated review, in January 2014 we searched, according to the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases model, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library ), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL; and major conference proceedings (up to January 2014). Key results The review updates the previous version but still fails to present any obvious superiority of one technique over another among the different kinds of interventions. Self-expanding metal stents provided safer and more effective relief of dysphagia compared to rigid plastic stents. Other techniques like radiotherapy or brachytherapy were also suitable alternatives and might be favourable in improving quality of life and prolonging survival. Individual differences should be emphasised when the intervention type was determined. Quality of the evidence Half of the studies included in this review were of high quality. Most studies did not state the methods used to seek and report quality of life outcomes and adverse effects.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To manage the acquired benign complicated tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) and bronchial-gastric stump fistula (BGSF) are clinical technical  challenge. The purpose of this study is to retrospectively review a surgical  "double patch" technique in treating nonmalignant complicated TEF and BGSF, and  then clarify the long-term curative effect of the technique. METHODS: Clinical  records of 30 patients with non-malignant complicated TEF and BGSF treated by  "double patch" technique in Tangdu Hospital between August 2004 and August 2014,  were analyzed and summarized retrospectively. RESULTS: Thirty patients (19 males  and 11 females) underwent "double patch" surgical repair of acquired benign  complicated TEF and BGSF. The median age of the patients was 40.2{\textpm}21.1 years. The  most common causes were the following: TEF [22], BGSF [8]. Post-intubation injury  [6], trauma [5], foreign body and stents [10], complications from prior  esophageal surgery [8], and caustic ingestion [1]. The follow-up was completed  for 24 months in all the patients (100\%). The operative mortality was 0\% (0/30).  Twenty-six patients (86.7\%) recovered uneventfully while four patients (13.3\%)  exhibited some major complications in the perioperative and postoperative  periods. One patient (3.3\%) developed recurrence of tracheal fistula in situ, two  patients (6.7\%) showed pneumonia, and one patient (3.3\%) developed fistula  esophageal anastomosis. All the 30 patients resumed oral intake finally.  CONCLUSIONS: The double patch technique is an effective and safe method to repair  the acquired non-malignant complicated TEF and BGSF.},

In general, perforation  of the esophagus often results in periesophagitis and even fatal abscesses. The  presence of a giant foreign body in the neck without obvious symptoms or  complications for many years is rare. CASE SUMMARY: We present the case of a  32-year-old man who intentionally swallowed a thermometer which was unable to be  located by endoscopy at his initial visit. He had no remarkable symptoms for 5  years other than paresthesia and limited movement of the left neck until 7 d  before this admission. The foreign body was removed successfully by the surgery.  CONCLUSION: The presence of a giant foreign body in the neck without obvious  symptoms or complications for many years is rare. Both endoscopic and  radiological examinations are essential for the diagnosis of alimentary foreign  bodies.},

  abstract = {Introduction and importance Although foreign bodies are a rare cause of gastrointestinal tract perforation, they may serve as a nidus for hepatic abscess. Abdominal pain is the most common presenting symptom. We present a case of an ingested pen causing duodenal perforation and hepatic abscess several months after initially presenting with a pericardial effusion. Case presentation A 59-year-old female living in an intensive tertiary mental health facility was noted to have an incidental pericardial effusion during work-up for hyponatremia. Seven months later, she developed a new fever and was noted to have interval increase in the pericardial effusion size. This prompted further investigation which finally revealed that an ingested pen had perforated through the first part of the duodenum and caused an abscess in the left lobe of the liver. The pericardial effusion was presumed secondary to local inflammation. Upon discovery of the abscess, the patient underwent successful operative management including abscess drainage, foreign body extraction, and duodenal repair. Clinical discussion Reports of hepatic abscess from foreign body causing duodenal perforation are rare, with bone fragments and toothpicks the most common foreign bodies implicated. There is one other previously reported case of an ingested pen. Abdominal pain is present in up to 85\% of cases, but fever may be the only presenting symptom. Conclusion Foreign body migration causing a hepatic abscess may present non-specifically with unexplained fever or even pericardial effusion. Psychiatric comorbidities may contribute to delays in diagnosis due to difficulties recalling the episode of ingestion.},

This study aimed to analyze the incidence of inedible substance ingestion in a Japanese psychiatric hospital. Methods: Inedible substance ingestion incidents were extracted from an incident report database spanning 2000--2012 at a 400-bed psychiatric hospital in Japan. We tabulated the frequencies of incidents in accordance with major diagnosis, ingested materials, incident levels, and time of occurrence. Results: The incidence rate was 0.09/1000 patient days, and 149 cases in 105 patients were classified as having experienced inedible substance ingestion. The most common diagnosis was dementia (n = 58), followed by schizophrenia (n = 22).

Materials ingested by schizophrenic patients were liquid soap, detergent or shampoo, and cigarettes. Inedible substance ingestion among dementia patients occurred mostly before or during meals. Among schizophrenic patients, the peak period of incidents was in the evening. Conclusions: Dementia patients were overrepresented in the inedible substance ingestion incidents. Items they wore or applied to their bodies were often subject to ingestion, and such behaviours mostly occurred around meal time. Therefore, the nursing staff were able to discover them quickly and treat most of the cases free of serious consequences.

METHODS: We review our experience to compare surgical and nonsurgical  approaches for treating symptomatic body-packing patients. RESULTS: From April  2004 to March 2007, 45 patients were referred to our hospital. Nine of them  underwent surgical intervention. The number of packets and total swallowed drugs  were more among surgically-treated patients (P = 0.003, 0.004 respectively). The  mean duration between drug swallowing and admission to the hospital was longer  among surgically-treated patients (P = 0.001). Surgically-treated patients were  more symptomatic. Resistant toxicity and symptomatic cocaine and heroin mixture  packing were the most common indications for surgery. Surgery was usually  performed without any complication. CONCLUSION: Surgical intervention is  indicated for body packers with persistent nonresponsive toxicity,  gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation, and symptomatic cocaine packers.},

We determined the frequency, yield, and costs of tests obtained to evaluate older persons with syncope. We also calculated the cost per test yield and determined whether the San Francisco Syncope Rule (SFSR) improved test yield. Methods---Review of 2,106 consecutive patients 65 years and older admitted following a syncopal episode. Results---Electrocardiograms (99\%), telemetry (95\%), cardiac enzymes (95\%), and head computed tomography (CT) (63\%) were the most frequently obtained tests. Cardiac enzymes, CTs, echocardiograms, carotid ultrasounds, and electroencephalography all affected diagnosis or management in {$<$}5\% of cases and helped determine etiology of syncope {$<$} 2\% of the time. Postural blood pressure, performed in only 38\% of episodes, had the highest yield with respect to affecting diagnosis (18-26\%) or management (25-30\%) and determining etiology of the syncopal episode (15-21\%). The cost per test affecting diagnosis or management was highest for electroencephalography (\$32,973), CT (\$24,881), and cardiac enzymes (\$22,397) and lowest for postural blood pressure (\$17-\$20). The yields and costs for cardiac tests were better among patients meeting, than not meeting, SFSR. For example, the cost per cardiac enzymes affecting diagnosis or management was \$10,331 in those meeting, versus \$111,518 in those not meeting, the SFSR. Conclusions---Many unnecessary tests are obtained to evaluate syncope. Selecting tests based on history and examination and prioritizing less expensive and higher yield tests would ensure a more informed and cost-effective approach to evaluating older patients with syncope.},

Unintentional foreign body ingestion commonly occurs accidentally in children aged between 3 months and 6 years and at advanced ages or results  from psychiatric disorders such as hallucination in patients with mental  retardation. Most of the ingested foreign bodies are naturally discharged from  the body but some of them may require surgical intervention. Presentation of  Case. A 29-year-old mentally retarded female patient was admitted to the  emergency service with a two-day history of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness, defense, and rebound on  palpation. Radiological examination revealed diffuse air-fluid levels and a  radiopaque impression of a metal object in the right upper quadrant. The metal  teaspoon causing ileal perforation was extracted by emergency laparotomy. On  postoperative day 7, the patient was uneventfully discharged following a  psychiatric consultation. Discussion. Foreign body ingestion can occur  intentionally in children at developing ages and old-age patients, or adults and  prisoners, whereas it may occur unintentionally in patients with mental  retardation due to hallucination. However, repeated foreign body ingestion is  very rare in individuals other than mentally retarded patients. Conclusion.  Mentally retarded patients should be kept under close surveillance by surgeons  and psychiatrists due to their tendency to ingest foreign bodies.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of a buffered crystalloid compared with saline on renal complications in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Editorial page 1695 Supplemental content at jama.com DESIGN AND SETTING Double-blind, cluster randomized, double-crossover trial conducted in 4 ICUs in New Zealand from April 2014 through October 2014. Three ICUs were general medical and surgical ICUs; 1 ICU had a predominance of cardiothoracic and vascular surgical patients. PARTICIPANTS All patients admitted to the ICU requiring crystalloid fluid therapy were eligible for inclusion. Patients with established AKI requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) were excluded. All 2278 eligible patients were enrolled; 1152 of 1162 patients (99.1\%) receiving buffered crystalloid and 1110 of 1116 patients (99.5\%) receiving saline were analyzed. INTERVENTIONS Participating ICUs were assigned a masked study fluid, either saline or a buffered crystalloid, for alternating 7-week treatment blocks. Two ICUs commenced using 1 fluid and the other 2 commenced using the alternative fluid. Two crossovers occurred so that each ICU used each fluid twice over the 28 weeks of the study. The treating clinician determined the rate and frequency of fluid administration. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was proportion of patients with AKI (defined as a rise in serum creatinine level of at least 2-fold or a serum creatinine level of Ն3.96 mg/dL with an increase of Ն0.5 mg/dL); main secondary outcomes were incidence of RRT use and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS In the buffered crystalloid group, 102 of 1067 patients (9.6\%) developed AKI within 90 days after enrollment compared with 94 of 1025 patients (9.2\%) in the saline group (absolute difference, 0.4\% [95\% CI, -2.1\% to 2.9\%]; relative risk [RR], 1.04 [95\% CI, 0.80 to 1.36]; P = .77). In the buffered crystalloid group, RRT was used in 38 of 1152 patients (3.3\%) compared with 38 of 1110 patients (3.4\%) in the saline group (absolute difference, -0.1\% [95\% CI, -1.6\% to 1.4\%]; RR, 0.96 [95\% CI, 0.62 to 1.50]; P = .91). Overall, 87 of 1152 patients (7.6\%) in the buffered crystalloid group and 95 of 1110 patients (8.6\%) in the saline group died in the hospital (absolute difference, -1.0\% [95\% CI, -3.3\% to 1.2\%]; RR, 0.88 [95\% CI, 0.67 to 1.17]; P = .40). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients receiving crystalloid fluid therapy in the ICU, use of a buffered crystalloid compared with saline did not reduce the risk of AKI. Further large randomized clinical trials are needed to assess efficacy in higher-risk populations and to measure clinical outcomes such as mortality.},

Multicentre collaboration can result in higher rates of patient enrolment than single-centre trials, thereby generating larger studies of shorter duration. Multicentre studies have rigorous study protocols to ensure uniform data collection among centres; however, heterogeneity in clinical practice among centres may be a major confounding factor in interpreting the results of these studies. The discrepancy between the results of single- and multi-centre studies may also be explained by variations in study protocols, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and adherence to study protocol. Factors related to timing of therapy, characteristics of the control group, and dosing of the study drugs may also be important. The results of multicentre studies should be interpreted with careful attention to their pros and cons.},

  abstract = {Foreign body ingestion is a relatively common occurrence, which may lead to morbidity and mortality. The aim of the present study was to report the experience of management of upper gastrointestinal foreign bodies by endoscopy in a large center. All patients who presented at the Department of Gastroenterology at Nanfang Hospital (Guangzhou, China) with complaints regarding upper gastrointestinal (GI) foreign body ingestion from December 1987 to December 2013. Hospital medical charts and endoscopic records were examined to evaluate etiology, treatment, and outcomes for these patients. A total of 846 patients were enrolled in the present study, from which foreign bodies were detected in 737 (87.1\%) patients via X-ray or endoscopy. The objects most frequently ingested were bones (n=395, 53.6\%). The detected foreign bodies were predominantly located in the cervical esophagus (n=325, 44.1\%). Endoscopic foreign body extraction was successful in 92.5\% of cases, whereas surgery was required in 6 patients. The most frequently used endoscopic accessory devices were retrieval forceps (n=480, 65.1\%). The complication rate was 6.9\%, including mucosal laceration (n=10) and others, all of which were managed conservatively. Associated GI diseases were reported in 74 (10.0\%) patients, including postesophagectomy (n=34) and others. In conclusion, the endoscopic procedure was safe and effective for the removal of foreign bodies from the upper gastrointestinal tract, with a high success rate and low complication rate.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Sharp-pointed FBs with both sides embedded in the duodenal wall are rare. Compared with smooth edged FBs, sharp objects are more likely to be associated with significant adverse events, when penetrating the wall of the digestive tract. The clinical features of patients who experienced sharp-pointed FBs embedded in both sides of the duodenum were retrospectively analyzed, as were the efficacy and safety of endoscopic removal of these FBs. Patients and Methods: This retrospective study included 21 adults with both sides of sharp-pointed FBs embedded into the duodenal wall who were admitted to the Second Xiangya Hospital in China between January 1, 1996, and May 31, 2021. Data associated with the endoscopic removal of these FBs were collected from the electronic medical record system (EMRS) of the hospital. Results: The incidence rate of duodenal total FBs and FBs embedded in both sides was 8.87\% and 1.03\%, respectively. The success rate of endoscopic treatment was 100.00\% in 124 patients without embedded duodenal FBs and 97.14\% in 35 patients with one side embedded duodenal FBs. Of the 21 patients with FBs embedded in both sides of the duodenal wall, endoscopic removal was successful in 85.71\% of patients, whereas 14.29\% required surgery. FBs removed from these patients included toothpicks in 12; needles in 3; jujube pits in 2; and a chopstick, dentures, fish bones, and chicken bones in one each. Most of these 21 FBs were located in the bulb and descending duodenum, followed by the third part of duodenum. Conclusion: Sharp-edged FBs with both sides embedded in the duodenal wall are rare. Endoscopic removal may be considered as a feasible, safe, and effective method of removing sharp-pointed FBs with both sides embedded in the duodenal wall. And if endoscopic removal is unsuccessful, surgical management can be a secondary option.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: The frequency of medical emergencies in a dental setting is relatively low. However, most dental treatment occurs outside of a hospital  setting; thus the time to respond to a life-threatening situation is crucial. The  aim of this study was to determine the frequency and characteristics of medical  emergencies that occurred at the Griffith University Dental Clinic over a 6-year  period. METHODS: Data involving medical emergencies was collected at a dental  school between January 2014 and December 2019. Data was obtained from the risk  incident reporting system (GSafe), and descriptive statistics were analyzed using  IBM SPSS. RESULTS: The frequency of medical emergencies in a dental setting over  the 6-year retrospective period based on the number of dental services provided  was 0.037\% (n~=~108). The three most common medical emergencies were syncope  (25.0\%), hypoglycemia (16.7\%), and foreign body ingestion (13.9\%). These happened  more often during dental extractions (26.9\%), followed by local anesthesia  (16.7\%) and restorative procedures (13.0\%). A larger portion of these incidents  occurred during dental treatment (62.0\%) as opposed to before (12.0\%) or after  (26.0\%). Most medical emergencies happened within the dental student clinic  (72.2\%) followed by the dental waiting room (19.5\%) and dental private clinic  (8.3\%). CONCLUSION: Overall, the number of medical emergencies at the Griffith  University Dental Clinic was low. The most common medical emergencies were  syncope, hypoglycemia, and foreign body ingestion. Dental education in  preventative strategies and training in basic life support is necessary to ensure  dental practitioners can manage the acute deterioration of a patient promptly.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND~           Gastrointestinal foreign body (GFB) ingestion is a common problem and often results in surgical consultation. Current literature is limited to case reports and fails to provide data regarding the management of sharp GFB ingestion. We hypothesized that patients who ingest sharp objects rarely have perforation or obstruction requiring surgical intervention.           METHODS~           Patients presenting with GFBs from January 2005 to December 2015 at a level 1 trauma center with an acute care surgery program were retrospectively reviewed. Exclusion criteria were leaving without being seen, noningested GFB, unknown or blunt GFB, or if the GFB was not found on imaging. Data collected included patient demographics, length of stay, imaging, and interventions that were performed.           RESULTS~           During the study period, there were 1,164 patients with 1,245 hospital visits for GFBs; 995 visits were excluded, resulting in 169 sharp GFB ingestion patients with 192 visits included in our study. The average age was 31. Sixty-five percent were men, and 41\% were incarcerated. The average length of stay was 3 days, which was longer in patients with psychiatric holds and consultations. Of the 169 patients, 116 (69\%) had no intervention and did not return for complications. Fifty-five endoscopies were performed with GFB removal in 30 cases. Seven patients (4\%) underwent surgery, five of which had peritonitis. When evaluating the total study cohort, 134 (79\%) of the patients had no procedure or a negative procedure. Patients requiring surgery had significantly larger objects (6 {\textpm} 3 cm) than those who had endoscopy (3 {\textpm} 2 cm) or no procedure (2 {\textpm} 1 cm).           CONCLUSION~           Surgical intervention occurred in only seven (4\%) patients with sharp GFB ingestions, and 79\% of the patients required no intervention. Barring an acute abdomen or esophageal sharp GFBs, patients can be discharged with return precautions, admitted for necessary psychiatric care, or returned to custody for patients seeking secondary gain. Upper gastrointestinal larger GFBs should be removed endoscopically when possible.           LEVEL OF EVIDENCE~           Therapeutic/care management study, level V.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of a balanced solution vs saline solution (0.9\% sodium chloride) on 90-day survival in critically ill patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Double-blind, factorial, randomized clinical trial conducted at 75 ICUs in Brazil. Patients who were admitted to the ICU with at least 1 risk factor for worse outcomes, who required at least 1 fluid expansion, and who were expected to remain in the ICU for more than 24 hours were randomized between May 29, 2017, and March 2, 2020; follow-up concluded on October 29, 2020. Patients were randomized to 2 different fluid types (a balanced solution vs saline solution reported in this article) and 2 different infusion rates (reported separately). INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either a balanced solution (n = 5522) or 0.9\% saline solution (n = 5530) for all intravenous fluids. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was 90-day survival. RESULTS Among 11 052 patients who were randomized, 10 520 (95.2\%) were available for the analysis (mean age, 61.1 [SD, 17] years; 44.2\% were women). There was no significant interaction between the 2 interventions (fluid type and infusion speed; P = .98). Planned surgical admissions represented 48.4\% of all patients. Of all the patients, 60.6\% had hypotension or vasopressor use and 44.3\% required mechanical ventilation at enrollment. Patients in both groups received a median of 1.5 L of fluid during the first day after enrollment. By day 90, 1381 of 5230 patients (26.4\%) assigned to a balanced solution died vs 1439 of 5290 patients (27.2\%) assigned to saline solution (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.97 [95\% CI, 0.90-1.05]; P = .47). There were no unexpected treatment-related severe adverse events in either group. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Among critically ill patients requiring fluid challenges, use of a balanced solution compared with 0.9\% saline solution did not significantly reduce 90-day mortality. The findings do not support the use of this balanced solution.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of a slower infusion rate vs control infusion rate on 90-day survival in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Unblinded randomized factorial clinical trial in 75 ICUs in Brazil, involving 11 052 patients requiring at least 1 fluid challenge and with 1 risk factor for worse outcomes were randomized from May 29, 2017, to March 2, 2020. Follow-up was concluded on October 29, 2020. Patients were randomized to 2 different infusion rates (reported in this article) and 2 different fluid types (balanced fluids or saline, reported separately). INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to receive fluid challenges at 2 different infusion rates; 5538 to the slower rate (333 mL/h) and 5514 to the control group (999 mL/h). Patients were also randomized to receive balanced solution or 0.9\% saline using a factorial design. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was 90-day survival. RESULTS Of all randomized patients, 10 520 (95.2\%) were analyzed (mean age, 61.1 years [SD, 17.0 years]; 44.2\% were women) after excluding duplicates and consent withdrawals. Patients assigned to the slower rate received a mean of 1162 mL on the first day vs 1252 mL for the control group. By day 90, 1406 of 5276 patients (26.6\%) in the slower rate group had died vs 1414 of 5244 (27.0\%) in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.96-1.11; P = .46). There was no significant interaction between fluid type and infusion rate (P = .98). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients in the intensive care unit requiring fluid challenges, infusing at a slower rate compared with a faster rate did not reduce 90-day mortality. These findings do not support the use of a slower infusion rate.},

  abstract = {Objective The assessment of subjective swallowing complaints constitutes an important element in a multidimensional, modern management of head and neck cancer patients suffering from dysphagia. For this purpose, an internationally recognized and validated 10-item questionnaire EAT-10 is used that was developed and validated by Belafski et al. in 2008. The purpose of the present study is the translation of EAT-10 into the German language and its validation for head and neck cancer patients. Material and Methods After the translation of EAT-10 into German according to the guidelines for the translation of foreign measuring instruments, a validation of gEAT-10 was carried out on the basis of the sample of 210 head and neck cancer patients. The reliability was determined by means of the internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha) and item-total correlations (Spearman). The construct validity was verified by the uni-and multivariate analyses of the distribution of gEAT-10 total scores depending on gender, age, BMI, tumor stage and localization as well as type of the oncological therapy. Results The internal consistency amounted to alpha = .94, the item-total correlations varied between rho =. 59 and rho = .85. No significant associations between gEAT-10 total scores and gender as well as age were identified in univariate calculations.Such associations were found for BMI, tumor stage and localization as well as type of the oncological therapy. However, only the tumor stage yielded a significant result in a regression. Conclusions The gEAT-10 was shown to be a reliable and construct valid questionnaire for the assessment of subjective swallowing complaints in patients with head and neck cancer.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Ingestion of a foreign body can cause different degrees of damage to esophagus, and several complications are potentially life-threatening if not  properly handled. The aortic injury caused by a perforating esophageal foreign  body is rare but lethal. The optimal management still remains controversial. The  purpose of this report is to describe our experience in the management of the  aortic injury caused by esophageal foreign body ingestion. METHODS: Between  January 2015 and December 2015, we retrospectively enrolled cases of esophageal  perforation involving the aorta by foreign body. The general parameters,  esophageal foreign body, types of aortic injury, treatment, and outcome were  analyzed. Additionally, we reviewed the literature of the management of  esophageal perforation involving the aorta caused by foreign bodies. The study  was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, College of  Medicine, Zhejiang University, and the need for informed consent was waived  (Quick review 2019, No. 609). RESULTS: Three cases of esophageal perforation  involving the aorta by foreign body was selected in the study. Two male and 1  female patients (range, 51-58 years old) with the aorta involvement caused by a  perforating foreign body in the esophagus in 3 forms were identified, including 1  patient with mycotic aortic pseudoaneurysm, 1 patient with aortoesophageal  fistula and 1 patient with the aortic intramural hematoma. One patient died of  the rupture of the pseudoaneurysm during the preparation of the surgery. The  other 2 patients were cured with a multidisciplinary approach, which is an urgent  thoracic endovascular aortic repair followed by mediastinal debridement/drainage  or endoscopic retrieval. Two of 3 patients were survived until now. CONCLUSION:  The management of the aortic injury caused by esophageal foreign body injury is  challenging. Early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management is crucial.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Vocal cord paralysis has been reported as a common complication of button battery (BB) ingestion, and there is a need to confirm the mechanism of  vocal cord paralysis for the development of a standardized treatment. METHODS: A  new CR2032 BB and artificial saliva were placed in a fresh pig esophagus with the  recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN); the negative electrode faced the nerve in the  experimental group, while the positive electrode faced the nerve in the control  group. The pH values of the intra- and extraesophageal walls were measured  simultaneously. Pathological examination was performed after the esophagus and  nerves were damaged. RESULTS: After BB ingestion, the pH near the intraesophageal  negative electrode increased rapidly, reaching 11.5~at 30~min and over 14~at 6~h,  while the extraesophageal pH did not change at 1~h and began to accelerate after  2~h, reaching 10~at 6~h. After 6~h of exposure, the pathological section showed  that the structure of the mucosa, submucosa, and muscle layer were destroyed;  chromatin in the nucleus faded, and part of the nerve bundle in the adventitia  had liquefaction necrosis. CONCLUSION: The basic mechanism of vocal cord  paralysis caused by BB ingestion is that the OH(-) generated by the electrolytic  reaction of the negative electrode penetrates the esophageal wall and corrodes  the RLN, which may be the cause of vocal cord paralysis caused by BB ingestion  without esophageal perforation.},

  abstract = {Injury causes a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) clinically much like sepsis 1. Microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) activate innate immunocytes through pattern recognition receptors 2. Similarly, cellular injury can release endogenous damageassociated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that activate innate immunity 3. Mitochondria are evolutionary endosymbionts that were derived from bacteria 4 and so might bear bacterial molecular motifs. We show here that injury releases mitochondrial DAMPs (MTD) into the circulation with functionally important immune consequences. MTD include formyl peptides and mitochondrial DNA. These activate human neutrophils (PMN) through formyl peptide receptor-1 and TLR9 respectively. MTD promote PMN Ca2+ flux and phosphorylation of MAP kinases, thus leading to PMN migration and degranulation in vitro and in vivo. Circulating MTD can elicit neutrophil-mediated organ injury. Cellular disruption by trauma releases mitochondrial DAMPs with evolutionarily conserved similarities to bacterial PAMPs into the circulation. These can then signal through identical innate immune pathways to create a sepsis-like state. The release of such mitochondrial `enemies within' by cellular injury is a key link between trauma, inflammation and SIRS.},

  abstract = {Background: Perforation is the most serious complication of esophageal foreign bodies. Studies examining the association between diabetes and esophageal foreign body-induced perforation are largely non-existent. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify the risk factors for esophageal foreign body-induced perforation. Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients with esophageal foreign bodies between January 2012-January 2017 was performed at the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital. The patients were divided into two groups: those complicated with perforation and those without perforation. Date on patient demographics, symptoms, foreign bodies, and diabetes were collected and analyzed. Study-specific odds ratio and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression models. Results: Of 294 patients with esophageal foreign bodies (41.84\% male, mean age, 56.73 years), 33 (11.22\%) complicated by perforation. Diabetes (odds ratio = 6.00; 95\% confidence interval = 1.72-20.23), duration ({$>$} 24 h) of foreign bodies retention (odds ratio = 4.25; 95\% confidence interval = 1.71-10.86), and preoperative fever (odds ratio = 8.19; 95\% confidence interval = 3.17-21.74) were strongly associated with an increased risk of perforation, whereas the sensation of a foreign body (odds ratio = 0.32; 95\% confidence interval = 0.09-0.92) was a protective factor of perforation. Glucose level was not observed to have an association among patients with or without perforation. Conclusions: Diabetes and duration of foreign body retention increase risk for esophageal foreign bodies complicated by perforation, and cases with elevated armpit temperature may represented a more likely perforation compared with those without fever.},

  abstract = {Sepsis-3 Definition Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection. The clinical criteria of sepsis include organ dysfunction, which is defined as an increase of two points or more on the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA). For patients with infection, an increase of 2 SOFA points yields an overall mortality rate of 10\%. Patients with suspected infection who are likely to have a prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay or to have in-hospital mortality can be promptly identified at the bedside with a quick SOFA (qSOFA) score of 2 or higher. Importance The sepsis-3 criteria have emphasized the value of a change of two or more points on the SOFA, introduced the qSOFA, and removed the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria from the sepsis definition. Objective To externally validate and assess the discriminatory capacities of an increase in the SOFA score by two or more points, the presence of two or more SIRS criteria, or a qSOFA score of 2 or more points for outcomes in 5109 patients, the vast majority of whom were postcardiac surgery patients who were admitted to a Cardiothoracic Surgical ICU in Singapore. Design, Setting, and Participants A retrospective cohort analysis of 5109 patients with an infection-related primary admission diagnosis in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CTICU) at the National University Hospital (NUH) in Singapore from 2010 to 2016. Exposures The SOFA, qSOFA, and SIRS criteria were applied to the data representing the worst condition within 24 hours of ICU admission. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results In 5109 patients, the average mortality of patients with an increase in the SOFA scores of less than 2 points was 3.5\% (n = 64), and it was 6\% (n = 199) for those with an increase in the SOFA scores of 2 or more points. The mortality of patients with an increase in the qSOFA scores of less than 2 points was 2.6\% (n = 7), and it was 5.3\% (n = 256) for those with an increase in the qSOFA scores of 2 or more points. The mortality of patients with an increase in the SIRS criteria of less than 2 points was 3.6\% (n = 30), and it was 5.4\% (n = 233) for those with an increase in the SIRS criteria of 2 or more points. The AUROC of in-hospital mortality of patients with an increase in the SOFA, qSOFA, and SIRS criteria of 2 or more points was 0.96, 0.95, and 0.95, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance In adults with suspected infection admitted to the CTICU in NUH, the change in in-hospital mortality between patients with an increase in SOFA scores of less than 2 and those with an increase of 2 or more was 2.5 percentage points. In contrast to other studies, the absolute change in mortality was nearly the same compared to the qSOFA and SIRS criteria, and the qSOFA score had the greatest percentage increase of 104\%, compared to 71\% for the SOFA score and 50\% for the SIRS criteria. Besides, from the perspective of discriminatory capacities, an increase in SOFA scores of 2 or more did not demonstrate significantly greater prognostic accuracy for in-hospital mortality than equivalent increases in qSOFA scores or SIRS criteria. These findings suggest distinctive characteristics of the study population in the CTICU that are different from the general population.},

  abstract = {Background: There is paucity of data regarding the prevalence and methods of deliberate self-harm (DSH) in patients with heroin dependence in international literature. In China, there have been a few studies investigating the prevalence of DSH in heroin-dependent patients (HDPs), but their rates varied widely. We thus conducted a meta-analysis of studies assessing the prevalence of DSH among Chinese HDPs. Methods: Relevant studies were retrieved from major Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang data, and SinoMed) and western databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycInfo). Two authors independently identified eligible studies and extracted data. Studies that included a representative sample of Chinese HDPs and ascertained DSH caseness in a reliable way were considered as high quality. Statistical analysis was performed using R software. Results: In total, 15 eligible studies with a total of 37,243 Chinese HDPs were included. All included studies were conducted in heroin detoxification settings. Only two studies were rated as high quality. The pooled prevalence of DSH in Chinese HDPs was 4.4\% (95\%CI: 2.9, 6.2\%), but the heterogeneity of prevalence rates across studies was significant (I2 = 98\%, P {$<$} 0.001). Studies rated as high quality had significantly higher prevalence of DSH than those rated as low quality (13.2 vs. 3.4\%, P {$<$} 0.001). Swallowing foreign objects was the most common method of DSH, with a combined prevalence of 2.7\% (95\%CI: 1.6, 4.4\%). Extreme DSH methods such as cutting offfingers and jumping from height were also not uncommon in this patient population. Conclusion: Due to methodological problems in available studies, we find a relatively low prevalence of DSH among Chinese HDPs receiving detoxification treatment. Nevertheless, the self-harmers of Chinese HDPs are more likely to harm themselves in a dangerous or life-threatening way. Restricting the availability of DSH methods may be an effective way to prevent or reduce DSH in China's detoxification treatment settings. {\copyright} 2018 Zhong, Xu, Xie, Chen and Lu.},

A systematic search was performed in the electronic databases PubMed and EMBASE using the key word "cannabidiol". Both monotherapy and combination studies (e.g., CBD + {$\Delta\Delta$}9-THC) were included. A total of 34 studies were identified: 16 of these were experimental studies, conducted in healthy subjects, and 18 were conducted in clinical populations, including multiple sclerosis (six studies), schizophrenia and bipolar mania (four studies), social anxiety disorder (two studies), neuropathic and cancer pain (two studies), cancer anorexia (one study), Huntington's disease (one study), insomnia (one study), and epilepsy (one study). Experimental studies indicate that a high-dose of inhaled/intravenous CBD is required to inhibit the effects of a lower dose of {$\Delta$}9-THC. Moreover, some experimental and clinical studies suggest that oral/oromucosal CBD may prolong and/or intensify {$\Delta$}9-THC-induced effects, whereas others suggest that it may inhibit {$\Delta$}9-THC-induced effects. Finally, preliminary clinical trials suggest that high-dose oral CBD (150-600 mg/d) may exert a therapeutic effect for social anxiety disorder, insomnia and epilepsy, but also that it may cause mental sedation. Potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic explanations for these results are discussed. {\copyright} 2012 the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUNDS: Previous reports of foreign-body ingestion focused primarily on accidental ingestion and very few studies focused on intentional ingestion of  foreign body (FB) in China. Our study aimed to compare the prevalence of  different age, gender, types, locations and management of FB ingested between  intentional ingestion and accidental ingestion of FB in Northern China. METHODS:  A retrospective case series studied all patients with suspected FB ingestion in  Digestive Endoscopy Center of Beijing Friendship Hospital, between January 2011  and January 2019. The patients were divided into 2 groups. Group A included the  patients who intentionally ingested FBs, and Group B included the patients who  accidentally ingested FBs. Patients' database (demographics, past medical  history, characteristics of FB, endoscopic findings and treatments) were  reviewed. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software. RESULTS: Group  A consisted of 77 prisoners, 2 suspects and 11 psychologically disabled persons.  Group B consisted of 1020 patients with no prisoners, suspects or psychologically  disabled persons. In Group A, there were no food-related foreign bodies, and the  majority of FBs were metallic objects (54.44\%). However in Group B, food-related  FBs were the most common (91.37\%). In Group A, 58 cases (64.44\%) were located in  the stomach, while in Group B, 893 cases (87.55\%) were located in the esophagus  (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). 1096 patients successfully underwent endoscopic removal and 14  failed, including 9 cases in Group A and 5 cases in Group B. The duration of FBs  impaction was longer in Group A than that in Group B (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In  our study, the patients who intentionally ingested FB were mainly prisoners, FBs  were mostly sharp metallic objects, the duration of FBs impaction was longer, and  the rate of successful endoscopic treatment was lower than that of the general  population. Attention should be focused on these patients.},
