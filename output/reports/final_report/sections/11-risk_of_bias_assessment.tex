\subsection*{Risk of Bias Assessment}

Risk of bias was assessed manually for all included studies by a single reviewer (JGE), using the \textit{Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklists for Case Reports and Case Series}~\cite{Moola_2020}. Studies were first classified as either case reports or case series based on the level of granularity in the data. Each study was then evaluated using the corresponding JBI tool.
