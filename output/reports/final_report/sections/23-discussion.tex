\subsection{Limitations of the Review Process} Several limitations of the review process should be acknowledged. First, although a comprehensive search strategy was implemented, it is possible that relevant studies were missed, particularly unpublished case series or reports not indexed in major databases. Second, screening and data extraction were conducted by a single reviewer, which may introduce the risk of human error or subjective bias in study selection and coding. To mitigate this, detailed protocols and reproducible scripts were used, and key results were cross-checked. Third, reporting of outcomes and predictor variables varied substantially across included studies, particularly in case reports, which limited the completeness and consistency of data synthesis. Finally, no formal assessment of study-level risk of bias was performed, as the majority of included studies were descriptive case series and reports without comparative designs. These limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings of this review.
