In This Study, Aspiration Of Screwdriver  And Healing Abutment Is Reported With Literature Review. Materials And Methods: A  26-Year-Old Male Patient Was Referred From A Local Dental Clinic With The  Suspicion Of Ingestion Of A Screwdriver And Healing Abutment During The  Second-Stage Surgery. The Patient Reported Symptoms Including Dyspnea, Cough, And  Foreign Body Sensation. On The Chest Radiograph, A Radiopaque Foreign Body  Resembling The Screwdriver And Healing Abutment Was Observed At The Right Mid  Lung. Results: Bronchoscopic Examination Using Flexible Cable Was Performed Under  Conscious Sedation, And Microforceps Were Used To Remove The Instruments.  Aspirated Screwdriver And Healing Abutment Were Removed Safely Under Intravenous  Sedation. The Patient Did Not Have Any Symptoms Associated With Lung Aspiration  After Removal Of The Foreign Body During Follow-Up Periods. Conclusion:  Bronchoscopic Removal Is The Most Recommended Procedure For Removal Of The  Aspirated Foreign Body. This Can Be Performed Under Conscious Sedation.  Precautions, Such As Tethering The Screwdriver, Are Recommended During Implant  Procedures.",,False,,True,3.0

METHODS: For children under 15 years, all Victorian public hospital admissions, July 1987 to June 1995, due to asphyxiation or 'foreign body entering through other orifice' (which includes ingestions), were reviewed. Emergency department presentations due to asphyxiation and foreign body ingestion provided information on circumstances of, and the type of foreign bodies involved in the injuries. RESULTS: The childhood average annual admission rate for asphyxiation was 15.1 per 100,000. Food related asphyxiation peaked in infants under 1 year, and declined to low levels by 3 years. The main foods involved were nuts, carrot, apple, and candy. The rate of non-food related asphyxiation was relatively constant to 3 years of age and then declined by 6 years. Mechanical suffocation was less common. The annual admission rate for 'foreign body entering through other orifice' was 31.7 per 100,000. These injuries peaked in 2-3 year olds then gradually declined. About 80% of these foreign body admissions were ingestions, with coins being the major object ingested. Admission rates for these causes remained constant over the eight years. Asphyxiation resulted in a higher proportion admitted and longer hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of suffocation and strangulation needs to focus on a safe sleeping environment and avoidance of ropes and cords, while foreign body asphyxiation and ingestion needs a focus on education of parents and child carers regarding age, appropriate food, risk of play with coins, and other small items. Legislation for toy small parts could be extended to those used by children up to the age of 5 years, and to other products marketed for children. Design changes and warning labels also have a place in prevention.",False,,True,3.0

Methods: The Esophageal Structure And  Function Of 8 Patients Treated For Afbi Requiring Endoscopic Removal Of  Alimentary Foreign Bodies In 6 Of Them (Up To 4 Times In 1 Case) Were  Investigated By Barium Meal, Esophagoscopy-Biopsy, Ph-Metering, Pull-Through  Stationary Manometry, And 24-Hour Ambulatory Manometry. The Results Were Compared  With Those In A Group Of Age-Matched Regular Refluxers (N = 14) Without Afbi.  Results: Six Boys And 2 Girls Aged 108 +/- 59 Months Had Impaction. Six Children  Had Symptoms Of Ger Like Vomiting During Infancy, Heartburn, Or Respiratory Tract  Disease. Barium Swallow Ruled Out Stenosis In All Patients And Showed Small  Hiatal Hernias In 3. All Had Endoscopic And Histologic Esophagitis (Moderate To  Severe In 6), And One Had Schatzki Ring. All But One (Who Had 8.45 Mm Hg) Had  Normal Lower Esophageal Sphincter Pressure (16.2 +/- 4.7 Mm Hg, Mean +/- Sd), And  All Showed Normal Sphincteric Relaxation. Esophageal Body Motility Was Not  Significantly Different From That In Regular Refluxers Except In 6 Children In  Whom Energetic Distal Peristalsis After Reflux Episodes Could Be Seen  Particularly During The Night. Three Of Them Had Amazingly Powerful Distal Waves  During The Day And Even Stronger, Simultaneous, Wide And Bizarre-Shaped Waves  During Sleep.

Methods: Retrospective Chart Review (Jan 2000-Feb 2018) Recruiting Children With  Impacted Esophageal Fbs. Fbs In Cricopharynx And Those That Moved To Stomach Were  Excluded. Investigations/Management Were Based On Underlying Anatomical  Pathology, Duration Of Impaction, And Difficult Fbs. Clinical Details,  Management, And Outcomes Were Collated. Results: Of 86 Children, N1 = 31 Had  Identifiable Predisposing Anatomic Pathology And N2 = 55 Had Impactions In Normal  Esophagus Or Difficult Fbs.

Therefore, It Is Important That Radiologists Be Aware Of This Commonly Encountered Entity. Attempted Suicide May Take A Variety Of Forms; Those Discussed By The Authors Include Sharp Force Injury, Immolation And Inhalation, Ingestion, Hanging, Firearm Use, Jumping From A Height, And Drowning. Certain Radiologic Findings Are Commonly Seen In Cases Of Attempted Suicide And Other Self-Injurious Behaviors. In Some Cases, Especially When The Patient Is Unconscious Or Is Unwilling To Provide A History, It May Not Be Apparent That Suicide Has Been Attempted Until Characteristic Imaging Findings Are Recognized. Correct Identification Of Suicide Attempts On The Basis Of Such Findings Will Ensure That These Patients Receive Appropriate Psychiatric Treatment. When A Suicide Attempt Is Unsuccessful, It Is Important To Be Familiar With The Complications That May Contribute To Delayed Mortality And Morbidity. The Radiologist Plays An Integral Role In The Acute Medical Or Surgical Management Of Patients Who Have Attempted Suicide. In Addition, Imaging Examinations May Provide Useful Forensic Information.

Paediatric Gi Endoscopy Is A Core Competency Every Paediatric  Gastroenterologist Should Possess, And Represents One Of The Most Common  Procedures Performed In Children For Both Diagnostic And Therapeutic Purposes.  Yet There Remains A Dearth Of Literature On The Utility And Outcomes Of  Paediatric Gi Endoscopy In The Asia-Pacific Region. Data On The Diagnostic Value  Of Paediatric Gi Endoscopy Would Be An Important Aspect Of Discussion, With The  Emergence Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ibd) And Eosinophilic Gi Disease As  Increasingly Common Endoscopic Diagnoses. Time-Based Trends In Paediatric Gi  Endoscopy Do Point Towards More Ibd And Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Related  Complications Being Diagnosed, With A Declining Incidence Of Gi Bleeding.  However, The Real-World Diagnostic Value Of Endoscopy In Asia Must Be  Contextualised To The Region-Specific Prevalence Of Paediatric Gi Diseases.  Helicobacter Pylori Infection, Particularly That Of Multidrug-Resistant Strains,  Remains A Highly Prevalent Problem In Specific Regions. Paediatric Functional Gi  Disorders Still Account For The Majority Of Childhood Gi Complaints In Most  Centres, Hence The Diagnostic Yield Of Endoscopy Should Be Critically Evaluated  In The Absence Of Alarm Symptoms. Gi Therapeutic Endoscopy Is Also Occasionally  Required For Children With Ingested Foreign Bodies, Intestinal Polyposis Or  Oesophageal Strictures Requiring Dilation. Endoscopic Haemostasis Is A  Potentially Life-Saving Skill In Cases Of Massive Gi Bleeding Typically From  Varices Or Peptic Ulcers.
