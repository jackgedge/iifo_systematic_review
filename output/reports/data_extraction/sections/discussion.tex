\section{Discussion}

In prison populations,
On multivariate analyses, hospital admission was associated with number of items ingested (OR 1.3, P < 0.05). The need for endoscopy was independently associated with ingestion of multiple objects (OR 3.3, P < 0.05). Surgical therapy was significantly associated with increasing number of ingested items (OR 1.07 per item, P < 0.05). Endoscopy is associated with significantly lower odds of surgery (OR 0.13, P < 0.01). \cite{Dalal_2013}. 

Did not examine rates of true ingestion in larger studies. 

Did not examine item location.
