It Has Attracted Great Interest Among Mental Health  Professionals Over The Last Decades. However, This Issue Is Rarely Reported In  The Literature. A Deep Exploration Of Its Clinical And Specific  Psychopathological Aspects Remains Limited. Case Report: We Report The Case Of A  32-Year-Old Female Patient, Who Was Sentenced To 20 Years In Prison For Homicide  Against Her Cousin, The Daughter Of An Uncle Who Had Raped Her When She Was 14.  This Affair Was Hushed By The Patient'S Family And The Patient Was Submitted To  Several Acts Of Abuse By Her Family. Following Her Incarceration, She Repeatedly  Ingested Metallic Objects Requiring Repeated Admissions In A Department Of  Surgery For Endoscopic Extractions Or Surgical Interventions. She Impulsively  Ingested More Than 30 Times Various Metallic Objects Such As Wire, Razor Blades,  Spoons, Etc., Under The Pressure Of Impulsiveness And Massive Anxiety. Voluntary  Metal Ingestions, Associated With Iterative Self-Mutilation Behaviors, Took Place  Within The Framework Of A Borderline Personality Disorder, The Incarceration And  The Conditions Of Imprisonment Playing A Role In Initiating And Retaining The  Behavior. Conclusion: Through This Case Report, We Examine The Specific  Psychiatric Aspects Of Intentional Ingestion Of Metallic Objects In Order To  Better Understand This Behavior.},

All Cases Were Subjected To Complete History Taking, Physical, Radiological, And Bronchoscopic Examination. Results A Total Of Fourteen [14] Patients Were Presented With Fbi Based On A Full History, Examination, And Essential Investigation. The Vast Majority 92.9\% Of Presented Cases (13 Out Of 14) Were Less Than 6 Years Old. 50\% Of Them (50\%) (7 Out Of 14) Were Less Than One Year Old.

Methods: This Study Was A Retrospective Analysis Of 124 Children Aged From  1~Month To 18~Years Who Ingested Batteries And Were Treated In A Tertiary Care  Center From January 1, 2014 To March 31, 2019. The Data Studied Included Age,  Sex, Presenting Symptoms At The Time Of Evaluation, Type And Size Of Battery And  Modality Of Management. Results: Twenty-Three (18.5\%) Patients Ingested  Cylindrical Batteries (Cbs), And 101 (81.5\%) Ingested Bbs. The Duration Of  Hospital Stay Was Significantly Longer (P\,=\,0.004) In The Group Of Children Who  Ingested Bbs Larger Than 20~Mm. Endoscopic Removal Was Performed In 75 (60.5\%)  Children, 46 (37.1\%) Were Followed Up And Three (2.4\%) Underwent Open Surgeries.  Children With Cbs Ingestion, In 55\% Of Cases, Had Gastric Mucosal Injuries.  Children With Bbs Impacted In The Esophagus In 96\% Cases Had Visible Severe  Mucosal Damage, Whereas Patients With Gastric Bb Ingestion 19.5\% Had Superficial  Gastric Mucosal Damage. Conclusion: Performing Timely Endoscopic Retrieval In  Children Who Are Admitted Early To The Hospital Will Reduce The Risk Of Damage To  The Gastrointestinal Mucosa, Especially In The Stomach. Unlike Bbs, Cbs, Despite  Their Large Size, Have Advantageous Shapes, Uneventfully Pass The Esophagus And  Are More Often Retained In The Stomach; Thus, Mucosal Injuries Are More Often  Observed In The Stomach. Consequently, Endoscopic Extraction Is The Treatment Of  Choice For Children With Bb Ingestion.},

Case  Presentation: A 42-Year-Old Male Was Admitted To The Emergency Department With  Symptoms Including Choking, Drooling From The Mouth, Holding His Neck, And  Aphonia. He Had A History Of Psychiatric Illness With Suicidal Ingestion Of A  Foreign Body. After Stabilization, He Was Sent For Chest Radiograph, Which  Revealed A Significant Radiopaque Shadow The Shape Of A Spanner, Occupying The  Whole Length Of The Esophagus. Emergency Rigid Esophagoscopy Was Performed To  Save The Patient'S Life. Discussion: The Patient Swallowed The Largest Hard  Foreign Body To Harm Himself Or His Family, To Get The Attention Of His Family,  Or As A Suicide Attempt.

A Pubmed And Google Scholar Search  Discovered A Variety Of Case Reports Detailing Various Methods And Indications  For Endoscopic Retrieval Of Right Sided Colonic Foreign Bodies. This Case Report  Endeavors To Supplement The Literature So That Guidelines Can One Day Be  Established For Colonoscopic Retrieval Of Right-Sided Foreign Bodies. Case  Presentation: 36-Year-Old Male Prisoner Swallowed 6.5~Cm Nail Clippers With A  Long-Standing History Of Intentional Foreign Body Ingestion (Fbi) Including  Multiple Laparotomies For Foreign Body Retrievals. Computerized Tomography (Ct)  Was Used Initially To Confirm The Position Of The Nail Clippers. After Almost Two  Weeks Of Failure Of The Foreign Body (Fb) To Move Beyond The Caecum As  Demonstrated On Plain Abdominal X-Rays, The Patient Had A Colonoscopy With  Successful Retrieval Of The Fb. Clinical Discussion: This Case Report Hopes To  Encourage The Consideration Of Colonoscopy For Retrieval Of Right Sided Colonic  Foreign Bodies That Have Failed To Pass On Their Own And Where An Operation May  Come With Increased Risk (Multiple Laparotomies, Multiple Comorbidities, And  Higher Anaesthetic Risk For A General Anaesthetic). Colonoscopy/Endoscopy Still  Has Inherent Risk And This Patient Did Have An Episode Of Temporary Laryngospasm  That Required Intubation And Monitoring In The Intensive Care Unit Post  Operatively.

The Case Report Has Been Reported In Line  With The Scare 2020 Criteria (Agha Et Al., 2020 [2]).

Pediatric Gastroenterologists And Surgeons Were  Increasingly Tasked With Removing These Problematic Objects. The Purpose Of This  Study Was To Assess The Utility Of Single-Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (Sils) In  The Management Of Ingested Magnets. Patients And Methods: This Is A  Single-Center, Retrospective Assessment Of Surgical Interventions For Ingested  Magnets. International Classification Of Disease, 10Th Revision Codes Were Used  To Identify 349 Patients {$\leq$}21 Years Of Age Evaluated For Foreign Body Ingestion  Over A 4.5-Year Period. A Medical Record Review Helped Isolate 29 (8.3\%) Magnet  Ingestions, 9 Requiring Surgical Intervention. Redcap Was Used For Analysis.  Results: Of 9 Surgical Patients, 7 Underwent Sils Intervention By 1 Surgeon.  Another Surgeon Performed An Open Operation, Whereas A Third Performed A  Multiport Operation. Of The 7 Sils Cases, 3 Were Completed Without Conversion To  Open. In One Of These Cases, Bowel Resection With Primary Anastomosis Was  Performed. For Sils Cases, Average Operating Room Time Was 109 Minutes (38-170  Minutes), Time To Enteral Feeds Was 23 Hours (0.28-79.2 Hours), And Hospital  Length Of Stay (Los) Was 3.8 Days (1.96-6.68 Days). Thirty-Day Readmission For  Sils Was 14.3\%. No Other Complications Were Observed. Conclusions: Sils Has Been  Safely Utilized For Magnet Retrieval. It Offers An Ability To Identify The  Affected Intestinal Segment And An Opportunity To Intervene Extracorporeally  Through An Uncapped Port. In Addition, Knowing Where Matted Bowel Is Located Can  Direct A Limited Incision During Conversion To Laparotomy.

Our Objective Was To Evaluate The  Guidelines' Impact On In-Hospital Resource Utilization And Short-Term Clinical  Outcomes In Hemodynamically Stable Patients After Endoscopic Battery Removal.  Methods: A Single-Center Retrospective Review Of All Ebbi Admissions From 2010 To  2020. Patients Were Divided Into Two Groups Based On Adoption Of National  Guidelines: Pre-Guideline (2010-2015) And Post-Guideline (2016-2020). Results:  Sixty-Five Patients Were Studied (Pre-Guideline N\,=\,23; Post-Guideline N\,=\,42).  Compared With Pre-Guideline, Post-Guideline Use Of Magnetic Resonance Imaging  (Mri) Increased (2/23 [8.7\%]; 30/42 [71.4\%]; P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Post-Guideline Increases  Resulted For Median Days (Iqr) Receiving Antibiotics (0 [0, 4]; 6 [3, 8];  P\,=\,0.01), Total Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Admission (0 [0, 1]; 3 [0, 6];  P\,{$<$}\,0.001), And Total Hospital Length Of Stay (5 [2, 11]; 11.5 [4, 17];  P\,=\,0.02). Two Patients In The Post-Guideline Group Had Delayed Presentations  Despite Normal Imaging: One With Tef And One With Aorto-Esophageal Fistula. All  Survived To Discharge. Conclusion: In Ebbi Cases Managed Using The Consensus  Based Nasphagn Guidelines, We Report Increased Resource Utilization Without  Improved Patient Outcomes. Further Research Should Evaluate Post-Guideline Costs  And Resource Utilization.},

Study Design And Setting: Cross-Sectional  Analysis Of National Databases; Literature Review. Subjects And Methods: The  Consumer Product Safety Commission'S National Electronic Injury Surveillance  System (Neiss) Was Used To Derive A National Weighted Estimate Of Emergency  Department Visits For Wire Bristle Injury From 2002 To 2014. Date, Location Of  Injury, Demographics, And Outcomes Were Analyzed. A Literature Search And A  Consumer-Reported Injury Database (Saferproducts.Gov) Were Interrogated To  Provide Ancillary Sources Of Data. Results: A Total Of 43 Cases Were Found Within  The Neiss Database, Which Extrapolated To An Estimated 1698 (95\% Confidence  Interval, 1468-1927) Emergency Department Visits Nationwide. In The Neiss  Database, The Mean Age Was 30 Years, And The Sex Distribution Of The Patients Was  Similar (21 Males Vs 22 Females). The Most Common Location Of Injury Was The  Oropharynx In Both The Neiss Database (23 Of 43, 53.4\%) And The Literature Review  (11 Of 36, 30.5\%). However, The Oral Cavity Was The Most Frequent Site In The  Consumer-Reported Saferproducts.Gov Database (9 Of 24, 37.5\%). The Majority Of  Patients In The Neiss Were Treated In The Emergency Department (31 Of 43, 69.7\%).  Raw Case Counts Were Highest In June, July, And August, With The Highest Number  Of Events In The Month Of July. Conclusion: Injury From Wire-Bristle Grill Brush  Is Uncommon But Prevalent During Certain Seasons. Otolaryngologists Play An  Important In The Diagnosis And Treatment Of These Injuries.

This Review Highlights The Latest Findings Regarding The Patients At  Risk For Button Battery And Magnet Ingestions, The Symptoms Of Presentation, And  Complications Of These Objects In Contributing To Long-Standing Gastrointestinal  Injury. Recent Findings: Button Batteries May Lead To Esophageal Injury Within A  Few Hours. Batteries Retained In The Esophagus Are Larger In Diameter On Average  And Size Is Associated With Esophageal Impaction As Well As Higher Grade  Esophageal Injury. Magnet Ingestions, When Multiple Or With Another Metallic  Object, Are Often Initially Asymptomatic But May Have Acute Worsening, And  Therefore Warrant Close Monitoring. Summary: Button Battery And Magnet Ingestions  Have Increased In Incidence Over The Past Two Decades. Recent Literature  Demonstrates That Higher Voltage, Larger Lithium Button Batteries, And Prevalence  Of High-Powered Magnets Can Lead To Significant Morbidity.

In Adults, Intentional Foreign Body Ingestion  Is Frequently Observed Among Individuals With Psychiatric Disorders And  Prisoners. Controversies Exist Regarding The Management Of Sharp Or Pointed  Objects. We Contribute To This Existing Controversy By Presenting A Case Of A  43-Year-Old Male Who Accidently Ingested A Metallic Screw And Was Managed  Successfully Through Endoscopic Retrieval. Case Presentation: We Discuss A Case  Of A 43-Year-Old Male Presented To Our Emergency Department After Accidently  Swallowing A Metallic Screw, 1~H And A Half Prior To His Presentation. He Was  Initially Asymptomatic Then Started To Complain Of Vague Abdominal Symptoms.  X-Rays Of The Chest And Abdomen Demonstrated The Presence Of A Metallic Screw At  The Mid-Abdomen. Computed Tomography Scan Of The Abdomen Then Confirmed Its  Presence Within The Gastric Lumen, With No Evidence Of Gastric Or Bowel  Perforation. The Patient Was Managed Via Esophagogastroduodenoscopy In Which The  Ingested Screw Was Extracted. He Was Discharged After 24 Hours In A Good  Condition. Clinical Discussion: A Limited Number Of Epidemiological Studies Have  Shed Light On The Prevalence And Incidence Of Foreign Body Ingestion Among Adult  Individuals. Probability Of Spontaneous Passage Depends On Several Factors  Including The Size, Shape And Composition Of The Impacted Item, As Well As The  Age Of Patient And Duration Of Ingestion Prior To Presentation. Conclusion:  Considering The Variation Of Ingested Objects And The Availability Of Several  Therapeutic Approaches, A Patient-Tailored Management Plan Should Always Be  Established.},

Depending On The Type Of Object, Different Complications Can  Occur. There Exist Numerous Methods For Removing Each Specific Fb. Fortunately,  Most Fbs Tend To Move Uneventfully Through The Gastrointestinal Tract Without Any  Intervention; But Managing Some Foreign Objects Can Be Difficult And Lead To  Severe Complications. Endoscopy Helps With The Diagnosis And Treatment Of These  Cases, But The Time Of The Management Plays An Important Role. Case Presentation:  A 26-Year-Old Female Who Intentionally Swallowed Two Sewing Needles, Presented To  Our Emergency Department With Abdominal Pain Two Months After The Fb Ingestion.  One Of The Sewing Needles Was Spontaneously Excreted Through The Bowel, And The  Other Was Present In Her Body For Two Months. The Fb Had Penetrated The Stomach  And Migrated To The Peritoneal Cavity. The Patient'S Condition Was Managed By  Laparoscopic Removal Of The Fb And Repair Of The Damaged Tissue. According To The  Traumatic Nature Of The Needle To Abdominal Viscera, And Standing Outside The Gi  Tract On The Pancreas Surface, Laparoscopic Removal Of The Foreign Metallic Body  Was Chosen To Be Performed. No Complication Was Seen During The Postoperative  Period. Conclusion: This Report Emphasizes The Importance Of Prompt Evaluation Of  Fb Patients And Finding The Appropriate Method Of Managing Its Complications.

The Main  Objective Of This Paper Is To Illustrate The Use Of Point-Of-Care Ultrasound  (Pocus) To Detect Ingested Foreign Bodies. The Secondary Objective Is To Describe  A Limited Training, Necessary For Emergency Pediatricians, To Obtain This Skill.  Methods: This Is A Case Series Of Eight Pediatric Patients Who Presented To The  Pediatric Emergency Department (Ed), With Suspected Ingestion Of Fb, And Were  Assessed With Pocus. Physician Sonographers Were Two Pediatricians And Three  Residents In Pediatrics Working In Two Italian Pediatric Eds. All Sonographers  Participated In A 2-Day Pocus Workshop Which Included The Most Common Pediatric  Pocus Applications. Results: Pocus, Performed By Emergency Pediatricians Who  Participated To A Limited Training, Allowed To Always Identify The Foreign Bodies  Ingested. Conclusions: We Demonstrate That An Appropriate And Limited Training  Allows Pediatric Emergency Physicians To Correctly Identify Foreign Body In The  Esophagus Or Stomach. Point-Of-Care Ultrasound In Foreign Body Ingestion In The  Emergency Department May Allow To Prioritize The Escalation Of Care In Children  And It Can Contribute To Reduce The Time To Endoscopic Management When Needed.},

Baseline, clinical, FBIs, and endoscopic characteristics and outcomes were collected and reported using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 381 endoscopies for FBIs, 288 (75.5\%) were emergent endoscopy and 135 (35,4\%) included underlying upper gastrointestinal conditions. The study population included 44 pediatric patients (11.5\%), 54 prisoners (15.8\%), and 283 adults (74.2\%). The most common type and location of FBIs were food boluses (52.9\%) and upper esophagus (36.5\%), respectively. While eight patients (2.1\%) developed major adverse events requiring hospital admission, the remainder (97.9\%) were discharged after observation. No mortality occurred. Endoscopic success was achieved in 263 of 286 (91.9\%) verified FBIs endoscopies. Endoscopic failure (8.04\%) was associated with age, bone, disk battery, intentional ingestion, razor blade, prisoners, and stomach in the univariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that intentional ingestion was associated with endoscopic failure (odds ratio: 7.31; 95\% confidence interval\>=\>2.06-25.99; P \>=\>0.002). CONCLUSION: Endoscopy for FBIs is safe and successful, with low hospital admission rate in children, prisoners, and adults. Intentional ingestion is a risk factor of endoscopic failure.},

Methods: Data Of Patients Admitted With A Foreign Body In The Rectum  Between 1988 And 2008 Were Retrospectively Analyzed. A Total Of 30 Patients Were  Reviewed. Results: The Most Common Reason For A Foreign Body In The Rectum Was  Insertion For Erotic Purposes, Which Was Seen In 19 Of The 30 Patients. All These  Patients Were Male. The Remaining 11 Patients Reported Nonerotic Causes. The Most  Efficient And Implemented Therapeutic Method Was Simple Extraction During The  First Examination. Conclusions: The Most Common Reason For A Foreign Body In The  Rectum Is Insertion For Erotic Purposes. The First Target Of Therapy Should Be  Extraction Of The Foreign Body Using The Simplest Method Possible. Meanwhile,  Protecting The Integrity Of The Intestine Is Of The Utmost Importance. The Care  For Maintaining The Integrity Of The Rectum Should Include An Evaluation Of The  Patient'S Psychological Status.},

Methods: Retrospective Review Of Patients Treated For Esophageal  Coin Ingestion At Children'S Hospital Of Wisconsin Over A 1-Year Period Using  Bougienage Or Endoscopic Retrieval Was Conducted. (Inclusion Criterion) Results:  Twenty-Seven Patients Were Evaluated Over The 1-Year Study Period. Two Patients  Spontaneously Passed The Coins Before Arrival And Needed No Further Treatment.  Twelve Patients Met Criteria For Bougienage, And This Treatment Was Successful In  10 Of The 12 Patients. Mean Length Of Hospital Stay Was 2.15 Hours, And The Mean  Cost Was \$546. Thirteen Patients Were Treated Successfully With Endoscopy. The  Mean Length Of Hospital Stay Was 22.7 Hours, And The Mean Cost Was \$5,230. There  Were No Complications In Any Of The 25 Patients. Conclusions: Bougienage Is  Equally Safe, More Efficient, And Much Less Expensive Than Endoscopy For  Treatment Of Esophageal Coins In Properly Selected Patients. Nearly Half Of The  Patients Were Excluded From Bougienage Because Of Delayed Presentation Alone.  Education Of Parents And Physicians Regarding Symptoms Of Coin Ingestion Would  Allow Primary Treatment With Bougienage In The Majority Of Cases.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Preterm Prelabour Rupture Of The Membranes (Pprom) Complicates Approximately 2\% Of Pregnancies And Can Be Either Spontaneous Or Iatrogenic In Nature. Complications Of Pprom Include Prematurity, Chorioamnionitis, Neonatal Sepsis, Limb Position Defects, Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Pulmonary Hypoplasia Chronic Lung Disease, Periventricular Leukomalacia And Intraventricular Haemorrhage. A Number Of Different Sealing Techniques Have Been Employed Which Aim To Restore A Physical Barrier Against Infection And Encourage The Re-Accumulation Of Amniotic Fluid. Routine Use Of Sealants Is Currently Not Recommended Due To A Lack Of Sufficient Evidence To Support The Safety And Effectiveness Of Such Interventions. Objectives To Assess The Effects Of Sealing Techniques Following Pprom Against Each Other, Or Versus Standard Care (Including No Sealant), On Maternal And Neonatal Outcomes. Search Methods We Searched The Cochrane Pregnancy And Childbirth Group'S Trials Register (30 May 2016) And Reference Lists Of Retrieved Studies. Selection Criteria Randomised And Quasi-Randomised Controlled Trials Comparing Different Techniques For Sealing Preterm Prelabour Ruptured Membranes. Cluster-Randomised Trials And Trials Using A Cross-Over Design Were Not Eligible For Inclusion In This Review. We Planned To Include Abstracts When Sufficient Information Was Provided. Data Collection And Analysis Two Review Authors Independently Assessed Trials For Inclusion And Assessed Trial Quality. Two Review Authors Independently Extracted Data. Data Were Checked For Accuracy. Main Results We Included Two Studies (Involving 141 Women - With Data From 124 Women). We Considered Both Studies As Being At High Risk Of Bias. Meta-Analysis Was Not Possible Because The Included Studies Examined Different Interventions (Both In Comparison With Standard Care) And Reported On Few, But Different, Outcomes. One Study Compared Cervical Adapter (Mechanical Sealing), And The Other Study Examined An Immunological Membrane Sealant. Neither Of The Included Studies Reported On This Review'S Primary Outcome Of Interest - Perinatal Mortality. Similarly, Data Were Not Reported For The Majority Of This Review'S Secondary Infant And Maternal Outcomes. Cervical Adapter (Mechanical Sealing) Versus Standard Care (One Study, Data From 35 Participants) No Data Were Reported For This Review'S Primary Outcome -  Perinatal Mortality . Data Were Reported For Few Of This Review'S Infant Or Maternal Secondary Outcomes. There Was No Clear Difference Between The Mechanical Sealing Group And The Standard Care Control In Relation To The Incidence Of  Neonatal Sepsis  (Risk Ratio (Rr) 1.19, 95\% Confidence Interval (Ci) 0.28 To 5.09 ( Very Low-Quality Evidence )) Or  Chorioamnionitis  (Rr 1.19, 95\% Ci 0.28 To 5.09 ( Very Low-Quality Evidence )). Oral Immunological Membrane Sealant Versus Standard Care (One Study, Data From 94 Participants) No Data Were Available For  Perinatal Mortality  (This Review'S Primary Outcome) Or For The Majority Of This Review'S Infant And Maternal Secondary Outcomes. Compared To Standard Care, The Immunological Membrane Sealant Was Associated With A Reduction In  Preterm Birth Less Than 37 Weeks  (Rr 0.48, 95\% Ci 0.34 To 0.68 ( Very Low-Quality Evidence )) And A Reduction In  Neonatal Death  (Rr 0.38, 95\% Ci 0.19 To 0.75 ( Very Low-Quality Evidence) ). However, There Was No Clear Difference Between Groups In Terms Of  Neonatal Sepsis  (Rr 0.64, 95\% Ci 0.28 To 1.46 ( Very Low-Quality Evidence )) Or  Respiratory Distress Syndrome  (Rr 0.64, 95\% Ci 0.28 To 1.46 ( Very Low-Quality Evidence )). Authors' Conclusions There Is Insufficient Evidence To Evaluate Sealing Procedures For Pprom. There Were No Data Relating To This Review'S Primary Outcome (Perinatal Mortality) And The Majority Of Our Infant And Maternal Secondary Outcomes Were Not Reported In The Two Included Studies. There Was Limited Evidence To Suggest That An Immunological Membrane Sealant Was Associated With A Reduction In Preterm Birth At Less Than 37 Weeks And Neonatal Death, But These Results Should Be Interpreted With Caution As This Is Based On One Small Study, With A High Risk Of Bias, And The Intervention Has Not Been Tested In Other Studies. Although Midtrimester Pprom Is Not A Rare Occurrence, There Are Only A Small Amount Of Published Data Addressing The Benefits And Risks Of Sealing Procedures. Most Of These Studies Are Retrospective And Cohort Based And Could Therefore Not Be Included In Our Data-Analysis. This Review Highlights The Paucity Of Prospective Randomised Trials In This Area. Current Evidence Provides Limited Information Both On Effectiveness And Safety For The Interventions Described. Given The Paucity Of High-Quality Data, We Recommend That Future Research Efforts Focus On The Conduct Of Randomised Trials Assessing The Effect Of Promising Interventions That Have Been Only Evaluated To Date In Cohort Studies (E.G. Amniopatch). Future Trials Should Address Outcomes Including Perinatal Mortality, Preterm Birth, Neonatal Death, Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Neonatal Sepsis And Developmental Delay. They Should Also Evaluate Maternal Outcomes Including Sepsis, Mode Of Delivery, Length Of Hospital Stay And Emotional Well-Being. Plain Language Summary Treatments For Improving Outcomes For Mother And Baby When The Waters Have Broken Too Early What Is The Issue? Preterm Prelabour Rupture Of The Membranes (Pprom) Is When The Waters Break At Less Than 37 Weeks' Gestation. It Occurs In One In 50 Pregnancies And Can Happen Spontaneously Or After A Medical Procedure Has Been Performed, For Example, Tests Where A Needle Is Placed In To The Womb To Get A Sample Of Fluid Or Tissue, Or After An Operation Has Been Performed On The Baby Inside The Womb. Why Is This Important? Breaking Of The Waters Early In Pregnancy Can Lead To Significant Problems Including The Baby Being Born Too Soon To Survive, Having Immature Lungs, And Serious Infections. Preterm Babies Are Overall More Likely To Be Ill And To Suffer From Long-Term Disabilities, If They Do Survive. The Survival Of Babies Affected By Pprom Is Related To How Early It Occurs In The Pregnancy And If An Infection Occurs. In Some Circumstances, The Waters May Reseal Themselves. This Is More Likely To Occur When No Infection Is Present. Several Treatments To Reseal The Membranes Have Been Tried, With Varying Success. Resealing Has Been Attempted By: A) Injecting Clotting Factors And Other Medicines In To The Hole In The Womb To Create A Patch Over The Area That Is Leaking; B) Taking Tablets That May Stimulate The Body'S Immune System To Mend The Area Where The Seal Has Broken; C) Placing A Sponge Over The Hole In The Waters; D) Placing A Seal Over The Neck Of The Womb To Stop Fluid Leaking Out And Prevent Infection. Our Study Is Important Because Finding A Successful Treatment For Pprom May Reduce The Potential Complications That May Happen To The Mother And Baby Such As Preterm Birth (Being Born Before 37 Weeks' Gestation) And Infections. What Did We Find? In Our Study We Assessed The Different Techniques Used For Resealing The Waters. We Aimed To Compare The Survival Of Babies Affected With This Condition Before And After Birth And Look At The Rates Of Complications In Both The Babies And Mothers. We Searched For Trials (30 May 2016) And Found Two Studies That Compared Treatments For Resealing The Membranes After They Had Broken. These Trials Involved 141 Women In Total And Compared Two Completely Different Modes Of Treatment. One Trial Compared The Use Of An Oral Immunological Membrane Sealant To Stimulate The Body'S Immune System To Mend The Area Where The Seal Has Broken And The Other Trial Placed A Mechanical Sealing Device Over The Cervix (Neck Of The Womb) To Stop Fluid Leaking. Unfortunately, Neither Trial Provided Any Data Relating To Death Of The Baby Within The Womb Or In The First 28 Days Of Life (Perinatal Mortality). There Was Limited Evidence To Suggest That Oral Immunological Membrane Sealant Was Associated With A Fewer Babies Being Before 37 Weeks' Gestation And A Reduction In The Number Of Babies That Died Within The First 28 Days. However, These Results Are Based On  Very Low-Quality Evidence  From One Small Trial (With Data From 94 Women) That We Judged To Be At A High Risk Of Bias. There Was No Clear Difference Between The Mechanical Sealing Device Group And The Control Group In Relation To The Number Of Babies Who Contracted A Serious Infection (Neonatal Sepsis) Or Chorioamnionitis (A Bacterial Infection That Causes Inflammation Of The Membranes Surrounding The Baby In The Womb). Although These Results Are Based On  Very Low-Quality Evidence  From One Small Trial (Involving 35 Women) Judged To Be At A High Risk Of Bias. What Does This Mean? Overall, Our Question Remains Unanswered - We Do Not Have Enough Data To Fully Evaluate Sealing Procedures For Pprom. This Review Demonstrates The Lack Of Research In This Area Regarding The Effectiveness And Safety Of Potential Treatments For Pprom. We Recommend That More Research Is Needed To Look At The Different Techniques For Sealing Broken Waters And That This Research Should Focus On The Effectiveness Of The Treatment In Improving Overall Outcomes. The Safety Of The Treatments To Both Mother And Baby Must Be Further Evaluated Before Sealing Techniques Can Be Recommended To Prevent Adverse Outcomes.},

In This Report, We Present  A Rare Case Of Razor Blades Lodged In The Appendix As A Result Of Intentional  Ingestion. Presentation Of Case: A 25\,Year Old Male Prisoner Presented To Our  Hospital With Persistent Right Iliac Fossa Pain After Razor Blade Ingestion.  After 5\,Days Of Conservative Management, There Was No Sign Of Transition On  Serial X-Rays. Laparoscopy With Intraoperative Image Intensification Confirmed  The Presence Of The Razor Blades In The Appendix And Appendicectomy Was  Subsequently Performed Without Complications. Discussion: Most Ingested Objected  With Diameter Less Than 2.5\,Cm And Length Less Than 6\,Cm Can Pass Through The  Gastrointestinal Tract Spontaneously In Less Than One Week. The Entry Of Foreign  Objects Into The Appendix Is Thought To Be Due To Relative Low Motility Of The  Caecum, The Dependent Position Of The Appendix And The Size Of The Appendiceal  Orifice. Radiographic Localisation To The Appendiceal Lumen Was Complicated By  Metallic Artefact, But Was Consistent With Failure To Transit. Appendicectomy Was  Felt To Be The Safest Mode Of Retrieval. Conclusion: Ingested Foreign Body Lodged  In The Appendix Is A Rare Event. Once The Exact Location Is Confirmed, A Simple  Laparoscopic Appendicectomy Can Be Performed To Facilitate The Removal.},

  abstract = {Background: Foreign Body Ingestion Is A Common Pediatric Problem. Coins Are By Far The Most Common Ingested Foreign Bodies. When Ingested Coins Become Lodged In  The Esophagus, They May Cause Serious Complications If They Are Not Removed In A  Timely Manner. Endoscopic Removal Is The Preferred Treatment In Many Pediatric  Centers As Its Safety And Effectiveness Are Well Established. Objectives: We  Performed This Study To Evaluate Safety And Effectiveness Of An Alternative  Method Of Managing Esophageal Coins, Using Bougienage Technique. Methods:  Previously Healthy Children Presenting To The Local Emergency Room With  Uncomplicated, Witnessed Coin Ingestion Of Less Than 24 Hours Duration Were  Prospectively Recruited With An Intent-To-Treat Analysis. A Single Oral Passage  Of A Hurst Bougie Dilator Was Performed By A Gastroenterologist To Dislodge The  Esophageal Coin Into The Stomach. If Bougienage Was Successful (X-Ray Showing  Coin In The Stomach), Patients Were Discharged And Instructions Were Given For  Monitoring Stools Until Passage Of The Coin Through Anus Was Confirmed. If  Bougienage Was Unsuccessful, The Child Developed Symptoms At Any Time Or If A  Coin Remained Intragastric For 4 Weeks, Endoscopic Removal Was Planned. Children  Whose Parents Declined To Participate In The Bougienage Treatment Received The  Standard Endoscopic Removal And Their Hospital Records Were Used As Controls.  Results: A Total Of 10 Children Were Enrolled In This Study, With A Mean Age Of  3.2 Years (11 Mo To 10 Y), 6 Boys And 4 Girls. All Received Little Or No  Sedation. Nine Children (90\%) Were Successfully Treated Using Bougienage, All Of  Whom Spontaneously Passed The Ingested Coins, With A Mean Duration Of 2.6 Days (1  To 7 D) Without Subsequent Intervention. A Single Case Failed Bougienage And  Underwent Endoscopic Removal. Three Children Declined Bougienage Treatment And  Underwent Endoscopic Removal. There Were No Reported Minor Or Major Adverse  Events With Any Of Our Cases. The Mean Health Care Cost For The Hospital Visit  For Bougienage Treatment Was \$1210, Compared With \$3100 For The Endoscopic  Removal (P{$<$}0.001). Furthermore, The Mean Time Spent In The Hospital From  Diagnosis To Discharge Was 2 Hours For Bougienage-Treated Patients Compared With  8 Hours For Endoscopic Treatment (P{$<$}0.001). Conclusions: Bougienage Of Impacted  Esophageal Coins Is An Effective, Safe, And More Economic Treatment Modality For  Selected Pediatric Patients With Uncomplicated Coin Ingestion. This Simple  Technique May Provide A Valuable Tool To Emergency Room Physicians Or Primary  Care Doctors Especially When Endoscopy Is Not Readily Available.},

Methods:  After Obtaining Permission To Conduct Iifo Research In Incarcerated Populations,  Study Patients Were Identified By Icd-9 Codes. Patient Charts Were Reviewed For  Demographics; Past Medical History; Iifo Characteristics; And Diagnostic,  Endoscopic, And Surgical Findings. Univariate And Multivariate Analyses Were  Performed Using Statistical Software. Results: Thirty Patients With 141 Episodes  Of Iifo Were Identified. The Mean Number Of Ingested Items Per Episode Was 4.60.  Endoscopy Was Performed In 97 Of 141 Iifo Instances, With Failure To Retrieve The  Ingested Object In 21 Of 97 Cases (22\%). Eleven Instances (7.8\%) Required  Surgical Intervention. On Multivariate Analyses, Hospital Admission Was  Associated With Elevated White Blood Cell Count (Odds Ratio [Or] 1.4, P {$<$} 0.05)  And Number Of Items Ingested (Or 1.3, P {$<$} 0.05). The Need For Endoscopy Was  Independently Associated With Ingestion Of Multiple Objects (Or 3.3, P {$<$} 0.05)  And Elevated White Blood Cell Count (Or 1.3, P~{$<$} 0.05). Surgical Therapy Was  Significantly Associated With Elevated White Blood Cell Count (Or 1.6, P {$<$} 0.01)  And With Increasing Number Of Ingested Items (Or 1.07 Per Item, P~{$<$} 0.05).

Radiologic Assessment Included Unenhanced Helical Ct And A Barium Contrast Study. Patients With Positive Findings Were Taken To Esophagoscopy. All Patients Had A Posterior Clinical Surveillance. Results: Twenty Patients Had Both Normal Ct And Barium Study And Satisfactory Clinical Outcome. In 12 Patients A Foreign Body Was Noted In The Cervical Esophagus By Ct, Barium Study, And Endoscopy. In One Patient A Fish Bone Was Detected By Ct (And Not By Barium) Confirmed With Esophagoscopy. Another Patient Bad A Fish Bone Esophageal Perforation Which Was Observed Only By Ct And Confirmed At Surgery. Two Patients With Normal Barium And Endoscopy Presented A False-Positive Ct Result. Conclusion: Barium Swallow Is Currently The First Radiologic Study, But May Involve A Risk Of Aspiration And Can Impede A Subsequent Esophagoscopy. Esophagoscopy Is An Invasive Technique With A Certain Risk Of Serious Complications That Can Be Avoided With A Satisfactory Radiologic Assessment. Ct Is Easy, Fast, Has 100\% Sensitivity And Is Therefore The First Choice Technique For Diagnosing Suspected Upper Esophageal Foreign Bodies Not Expected To Be Visible On Plain Radiographs.},

Methods: Twenty Children With Ingested Safety Pins During A 4-Year Period Were  Retrospectively Included In The Study. Results: Median Age Of Patients Was 9.5  Months (Interquartile Range, 6.3-14 Months), And 70\% Were Girls. On Endoscopic  Examination, Safety Pins Were Observed In The Stomach (25\%), Duodenal Bulb (20\%),  Upper Esophagus (15\%), Middle Esophagus (10\%), And Second Part Of The Duodenum  (10\%) But Were Not Observed In 20\% Of The Cases.

No Complications Such As  Perforation Or Deaths Developed, Except For Erosions, Due To The Foreign Body  Removal Procedure. Conclusion: Safety Pins Are Easily Removed Endoscopically. The  Best Option Is To Remove The Safety Pin Using Endoscopy While It Is Still In The  Esophagus And Stomach. For This Reason, Endoscopic Procedures Should Be Performed  As Soon As Possible In Children Who Have Ingested Safety Pins.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Intentional Swallowing Of Foreign Objects Is A Relatively Rare Psychopathological Behavior. Adolescents And Young Adults May Carry Out This Act To Hurt Themselves Or Even Suicide. Often, Most Reports Related To Deliberate Swallowing Are Typically Either Surgical Or Gastrointestinal And Rarely Are Found In Psychiatric Articles; More Often, The Swallowed Foreign Objects (80 - 90\%) Are Disposed Of Spontaneously, And 10 - 20\% Of Them Require Endoscopy For More Study And Less Than 1\% Of Them Need Surgery To Be Removed Or Its Complications. Case Presentation: The Presented Patient Is A 17-Year-Old Girl Admitted To The Psychosomatic Ward Of Afzalipour Hospital Due To Intentional Poisoning. During The Year Before Her Admission, On Three Separate Occasions, She Detached The Knife Blade From Its Haft And Swallowed It. She Underwent Laparotomy Twice, One Time For Sigmoid Tearing And Damage To The Left Ovary, To Remove The Knife And Regeneration Of The Left Ovary And Sigmoid, And Another Time To Remove The Knife In Order Not To Cause Damage To Her Intestines. To Our Knowledge, This Is The First Reported Case In The World In Which An Ovary Has Been Damaged. Further Investigation Into Her Background Shows Some Extent Of Privation Due To Her Family'S Long-Term Economic Problems And Instability; Moreover, Sexual And Physical Abuse Was Also Confirmed. The Patient Was Prescribed Clozapine, Which Decreased Her Suicidal Behavior And Attempts Noticeably. Conclusions: Swallowing Foreign Bodies In This Patient Is Interpreted As Both Self-Punishment And Punishing Others (Those Who Thought They Were Hurt Or May Be Blamed For Their Despair Or Rejection). Intentional Swallowing Of Foreign Objects Behavior Is More Resistant Than Other Self-Harming Activities And May Have A Worse Prognosis. Swallowing Foreign Objects Requires A Sophisticated Process That, If Not Correctly Managed, May Result In Serious Complications; Therefore, Appropriate Psychiatric Counseling And Supportive Treatment Are Necessary For These Patients. Specific To This Patient Eliminating The Effects Of Suicide And Reaching Medical Stability With A Short Admission Was Necessary. Her Suicidal Behavior And Attempts Decreased Significantly After Starting Clozapine Treatment. Therefore, Clozapine Treatment Is Recommended For Patients With Suicidal Behavior And Self-Harm. {\copyright} 2023, Brieflands. All Rights Reserved.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ingestion of foreign bodies may be seen unconsciously or intentionally in patients with mental health problems. Most cases pass through the esophagus slowly; however, in some cases, the tumor may be located in narrower areas of the digestive tract that require endoscopic or surgical intervention. This study describes a rare case of successful removal of more than 450 pieces of metal objects from the stomach of a 36-year-old man via ingestion of foreign bodies at Imam Khomeini Hospital in Ahvaz. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old male patient (Aryan race) presented with complaints of chronic abdominal pain, frequent vomiting, and intolerance to liquids and food. The patient's companions mentioned a history of gradual ingestion of small metal objects 3~months prior. The patient was conscious and had stable vital signs. In the patient's X-ray and endoscopy, multiple metal objects inside the patient's stomach were observed, causing gastric outlet obstruction. The patient underwent gastrostomy surgery, and 452 screws, nuts, keys, stones, and other metal parts weighing 2900~g were removed from the stomach. Five days after the operation, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric service in good general condition and was diagnosed with psychosis, and her condition returned to normal at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Successful removal of this foreign body is rare. In chronic abdominal pain, especially in the context of psychiatric disorders, attention should be given to the ingestion of foreign bodies. In swallowing large amounts of sharp and metallic foreign objects, surgical intervention is necessary, especially in cases of obstruction, and saves the patient's life.},

Methods: A Survey Focusing On The Indication And  The Timing Of Endoscopy For Sharp Fb Removal In Patients With Bpd Was E-Mailed To  215 Gastroenterologists, Psychiatrists, And Surgeons In Switzerland, Germany And  Austria, Discussing This Clinical Problem Using A Specific Case Vignette.  Results: Responses Were Received From 63 Of 215 (29\%) Contacted Physicians.  Two-Thirds Of The Respondents Knew Patients With Bpd Who Had Swallowed Fbs  Repeatedly; 86\% Recommended Removing Sharp Fbs Endoscopically Even In The Case Of  Repeated Fb Ingestion And 14\% Of Respondents Argued Against Emergent Endoscopic  Fb Removal In The Case Of Repeated Ingestions. Different Specialities Expressed  Partially Divergent Opinions Regarding The Management Of These Patients.  Conclusion: Repeated Fb Ingestions Can Be A Problem In Patients With Bpd.  Although Published Data Show That The Perforation Risk Of Unremoved Fbs Is Low,  Most Clinicians Support Repeated Endoscopies Also In The Case Of Repeated Fb  Ingestions. Nevertheless, In Selected Cases, Repeated Endoscopies Need To Be  Discussed And An Interdisciplinary Consensus And/Or The Involvement Of An Ethical  Committee Is Advised.},

  abstract = {Background/Purpose: Most Retained Esophageal Foreign Bodies (Fb) Are Identified Soon After Ingestion And Are Easily Extracted. A Minority Of Fb Ingestions Are  Not Identified For Weeks To Years And Present Significant Problems For Retrieval.  The Purpose Of This Study Was To Describe The Diagnostic And Therapeutic  Strategies Needed To Care For Children Who Have Chronic Esophageal Fbs. Methods:  Five Children Were Identified As Having Retained Esophageal Fbs 2 Months To 2  Years After Ingestion. During The Same 3-Year Period, 100 Children Who Had Acute  Fbs Were Identified And Had Their Foreign Bodies Removed Endoscopically. The  Average Age Of The Children Was 3 Years (Range, 2.4 To 3.5). Results: The Average  Age Of The Five Children Identified In This Study Was 3 Years. The Items Ingested  Included Coins, A Heart Pendant, A Clothespin Spring, And A Toy Soldier.  Complications From Chronically Retained Foreign Bodies Were Bronchoesophageal  Fistula, Mediastinitis, Esophageal Diverticulum, And Lobar Atelectasis. One  Patient Died From An Aortoesophageal Fistula. In All Children, Endoscopic Removal  Was Attempted. Barium Esophagram Was Then Performed, And Foreign Bodies Were  Eventually Removed Via Right Thoracotomy. Conclusions: Long-Retained Esophageal  Fbs Are Extremely Morbid And Life Threatening. History Most Often Identifies  Excess Salivation, New Onset Asthma, And/Or Recurrent Upper Respiratory  Infections. Three Diagnostic Adjuncts Are Helpful In Identifying The Presence Of  A Long Retained Fb: (1) Chest X-Ray (Pa And Lateral), (2) Barium Swallow, And (3)  Esophagoscopy. Indications For Thoracotomy For Removal Of Foreign Body Include  (1) Poor Endoscopic Visualization Of Fb Because Of Inflammatory Tissue And (2)  Herald Bleeding During Endoscopy.},

But Ingestion Can Lead To Mucosal  Damage, The Consequences Of Which Can Be Esophageal Perforation Or Stricture  Formation. We Hypothesize That The Monetary Value Of The Penny Is Far Less Than  The Cost Of Its Ingestion And Removal. This Quality Assurance Study Examines The  Effect Of The Penny On The Purse. Patients And Methods: This Retrospective Review  Identified 180 Foreign Bodies In Children Under The Age Of 18 Over A Five Year  Period. Eighty-Two Were Pennies. Operative Notes Revealed Degree Of Injury.  Hospital Charge Assessments Revealed The "Cost" Of Each Visit. Results: There  Were No Esophageal Perforations, And Cases Were Divided Evenly Among Injury  Grades 0-Iii. The Average Total Charge For All Penny-Related Injuries Was  \$7164.78. Conclusions: The Purpose Was To Examine The Actual Cost Of A Penny  (More Than Its Value In Production) And The Potential Cost Of Its Damage  (Thousands Of Dollars In Measurable Costs, Untold Immeasurable Costs). The Goal  Of This Study Is To Draw Healthcare Professional And Public Attention To A  Potentially Serious And Yet Highly Preventable Injury In Young Children.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Impaction Of A Soft Food Bolus In The Oesophagus Causes Dysphagia And Regurgitation. If The Bolus Does Not Pass Spontaneously, Then The Patient Is At Risk Of Aspiration, Dehydration, Perforation, And Death. Definitive Management Is With Endoscopic Intervention, Recommended Within 24 Hours. Prior To Endoscopy, Many Patients Undergo A Period Of Observation, Awaiting Spontaneous Disimpaction, Or May Undergo Enteral Or Parenteral Treatments To Attempt To Dislodge The Bolus. There Is Little Consensus As To Which Of These Conservative Strategies Is Safe And Effective To Be Used In This Initial Period, Before Resorting To Definitive Endoscopic Management For Persistent Impaction. Objectives To Evaluate The Efficacy Of Non-Endoscopic Conservative Treatments In The Management Of Soft Food Boluses Impacted Within The Oesophagus. Search Methods We Searched The Following Databases, Using Relevant Search Terms: Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials (Central), Medline, Embase And Cinahl. The Date Of The Search Was 18 August 2019. We Screened The Reference Lists Of Relevant Studies And Reviews On The Topic To Identify Any Additional Studies. Selection Criteria We Included Randomised Controlled Trials Of The Management Of Acute Oesophageal Soft Food Bolus Impaction, In Adults And Children, Reporting The Incidence Of Disimpaction (Confirmed Radiologically Or Clinically By Return To Oral Diet) Without The Need For Endoscopic Intervention. We Did Not Include Studies Focusing On Sharp Or Solid Object Impaction. Data Collection And Analysis We Used Standard Methodological Procedures Recommended By Cochrane. Main Results We Identified 890 Unique Records Through The Electronic Searches. We Excluded 809 Clearly Irrelevant Records And Retrieved 81 Records For Further Assessment. We Subsequently Included One Randomised Controlled Trial That Met The Eligibility Criteria, Which Was Conducted In Four Swedish Centres And Randomised 43 Participants To Receive Either Intravenous Diazepam Followed By Glucagon, Or Intravenous Placebos. The Effect Of The Active Substances Compared With Placebo On Rates Of Disimpaction Without Intervention Is Uncertain, As The Numbers From This Single Study Were Small, And The Rates Were Similar (38\% Versus 32\%; Risk Ratio 1.19, 95\% Confidence Interval 0.51 To 2.75, P = 0.69). The Certainty Of The Evidence Using Grade For This Outcome Is Low. Data On Adverse Events Were Lacking. Authors' Conclusions There Is Currently Inadequate Data To Recommend The Use Of Any Enteral Or Parenteral Treatments In The Management Of Acute Oesophageal Soft Food Bolus Impaction. There Is Also Inadequate Data Regarding Potential Adverse Events From The Use Of These Treatments, Or From Potential Delays In Definitive Endoscopic Management. Caution Should Be Exercised When Using Any Conservative Management Strategies In These Patients. Plain Language Summary Use Of Treatments To Dislodge Soft Foods Stuck Between The Throat And The Stomach To Try To Avoid The Need For An Endoscopy Review Question Can A Period Of Observation, Treatment With Swallowed Substances, Or Treatment With Substances Given Via The Blood Help To Dislodge Soft Foods That Are Stuck Between The Throat And The Stomach In Order To Avoid The Need For An Endoscopic Procedure To Clear It? Background Food Can Sometimes Get Stuck In The Oesophagus, The Pipe Connecting The Throat To The Stomach That Passes Through The Chest. This Food Often Dislodges On Its Own, Without Any Medical Help, But Occasionally A Doctor'S Help Is Needed To Clear It. Removing Or Dislodging These Lumps Of Food Can Be Done Using A Flexible Camera Or A Rigid Instrument, Called An Endoscope, But Endoscopic Procedures Can Have Serious Complications, Like Causing Holes In The Oesophagus. However, Waiting For Too Long For The Food To Clear On Its Own Can Also Increase The Risk Of A Hole In The Oesophagus And May Lead To Saliva Or Food Falling Into The Lungs, Causing Serious Infections. A Variety Of Treatments Are Currently Used To Try To Clear The Food, Without Having To Resort To An Endoscopy, Many Of Which Also Have Potential Side Effects, Including Difficulty Breathing, Increased Blood Sugar Levels, Low Blood Pressure, And Irregular Heartbeat. We Wanted To Know If Any Of These Treatments Were Better Than Simply Waiting For The Food To Clear On Its Own, Before Trying To Dislodge It With Instruments. Study Characteristics The Evidence Is Current To August 2019. We Found One Trial Suitable To Answer Our Question, Which Compared Giving A Patient Two Drugs Into A Vein In (Diazepam And Glucagon) To Placebos (Clear Liquids Which Appeared Similar To The Drugs But Have No Effect On The Body). We Did Not Look At Treating Sharp Or Hard Objects, As These Are Treated Differently. Key Results There Was Not Enough Evidence To Say With Certainty Which Treatments For Food Impacted In The Oesophagus Are Safe Or Effective. Quality Of The Evidence We Graded The Overall Certainty Of The Evidence As Low. More Studies With More Participants Are Needed To Be Able To Answer The Review Question.},

Patient  Demographic Data, Including Age, Gender, Intention To Ingestion, Symptoms At  Admission, And Comorbidities, Were Collected. Clinical Features Of The Foreign  Bodies, Such As Type, Size, Sharpness Of Edges, Number, And Location, Were  Analyzed. Endoscopic Data Those Were Analyzed Included Duration Of Foreign Body  Impaction, Duration Of Endoscopic Performance, Endoscopic Device, Days Of  Hospitalization, Complication Rate, 30-D Mortality Rate, And The Number Of  Operations Related To Foreign Body Removal. Results: The Types Of Upper  Gastrointestinal Foreign Bodies Included Fish Bones, Drugs, Shells, Meat, Metal,  And Animal Bones. The Locations Of Impacted Foreign Bodies Were The Upper  Esophagus (57.2\%), Mid Esophagus (28.4\%), Stomach (10.8\%), And Lower Esophagus  (3.6\%). The Median Size Of The Foreign Bodies Was 26.2 {\textpm} 16.7 Mm. Among 194  Patients, Endoscopic Removal Was Achieved In 189, And Complications Developed In  51 Patients (26.9\%). Significant Complications Associated With Foreign Body  Impaction And Removal Included Deep Lacerations With Minor Bleeding (N = 31,  16\%), Ulcer (N = 11, 5.7\%), Perforation (N = 3, 1.5\%), And Abscess (N = 1, 0.5\%).  Four Patients Underwent Operations Because Of Incomplete Endoscopic Foreign Body  Extraction. In Multivariate Analyses, Risk Factors For Endoscopic Complications  And Failure Were Sharpness (Hr = 2.48, 95\%Ci: 1.07-5.72; P = 0.034) And A Greater  Than 12-H Duration Of Impaction (Hr = 2.42, 95\%Ci: 1.12-5.25, P = 0.025).  Conclusion: In Cases Of Longer Than 12 H Since Foreign Body Ingestion Or  Sharp-Pointed Objects, Rapid Endoscopic Intervention Should Be Provided In  Patients With Ingested Foreign Bodies.},

We Aimed To Demonstrate The Association Between The Corrosion Of Lithium Button Batteries In The Esophagus On Radiographs And Their Complications. Methods The Nine Pediatric Patients Included In This Study Were Classified Into Two Groups Based On The Presence Of Severe Complications. The Presence And Degree Of Corrosion On Plain Radiographs Were Evaluated. The Degree Of Corrosion Was Classified Into The Following Three Grades; None: 0\%; Moderate: 1-50\%; Severe: 51-100\%. Fisher'S Exact Test Was Used For Statistical Analyses. Results Of The Nine Patients, Five Showed Complications. The Number Of Patients Who Had Grade None, Moderate, And Severe Degrees Of Corrosion Was Three, Four, And Two, Respectively. The Incidence Of Severe Complications Differed Significantly Between The Incidence Of Lithium Button Batteries' Contour (Without Vs. With Severe Complications [Presence/Absence Of Corrosion] = 1/3 Vs. 5/0, Respectively; P = 0.0476). In Cases With None Degree Of Corrosion, All Three Cases Had No Complication, And In Cases With A Severe Degree Of Corrosion, All Two Cases Had Complications. Conclusion The Cases With The Presence Of Corrosion Of Lithium Button Batteries Had A Higher Tendency To Have Severe Complications. Therefore, Physicians Should Anticipate The Presence Of Severe Complications In Pediatric Patients With Corrosion More Than Those Without Corrosion.},

Methods: We Utilized Survey Data From The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System To Examine Fundamental Characteristics Of Adult Fobis Involving Consumer Products Between 2000 And 2017 Across The United States. Data Regarding The Circumstances Of Fobis Were Abstracted From Narrative Data. Relationships Among Time, Intent, Demographics, And Behavioral Attributes Were Assessed Using Regression Analyses, Accounting For Survey Structure. Results: Adult Fobis Have Increased In Incidence Over The Past 2 Decades From 3 To 5.3 Per 100,000 Persons. Examination Of Consumer Products Revealed That Jewelry (15.4\%), Nails (7.2\%), And Toothpicks (6.9\%) Were The Most Commonly Ingested Products. The Most Common Products Ingested Varied Over Time, And The Number Of Unique Consumer Product Categories Ingested Increased From 103 To 143 In The Time Period Studied. Intentional Ingestions Accounted For 14\% Of Adult Fobis And Frequently Involved Plastic Bagging (13.6\%), Batteries (13\%), Nails (10.1\%), And Desk Supplies (6.8\%). Adjusted Regression Analyses Demonstrated That Compared With Accidental Fobis, Intentional Fobis Have Increased Over Time. Intentional Fobis Were More Frequently Associated With Younger Age, Substance Abuse, Police Custody, And Mental And Cognitive Illnesses Relative To Accidental Fobis. Conclusions: Our Results Indicate That Adult Fobis Are An Increasing Burden Of Disease In The United States With Social, Psychiatric, And Behavioral Contributors To This Trend.},

We Studied The Poorly  Understood Group Of Patients Who Intentionally Ingest Fbs. Methods: Cases Of  Intentional Ingestion Of Fbs (N = 305) Were Identified, Retrospectively, From An  Electronic Endoscopy Database And Followed. Cases Occurred Among 33 Different  Patients, Who Underwent Endoscopy From October 1, 2001, To July 31, 2009 (39.0  Cases/Year); 79\% Were Diagnosed With A Psychiatric Disorder. Financial Cost  Analysis Was Performed Using Hospital Billing And Cost Systems. Results: Commonly  Ingested Fbs Included Pens (23.6\%), Batteries (9.2\%), Knives (7.2\%), And Razor  Blades (6.9\%). Most Endoscopic Procedures Were Performed Under General  Anesthesia. Fbs Were Commonly Retrieved By Snares (58.0\%), Rat-Toothed Forceps  (14.4\%), And Nets (11.5\%), Assisted Sometimes By Use Of Overtubes (10.8\%), And  Hoods (4.6\%). Fb Extraction Was Unsuccessful At The Initial Endoscopy In Only 20  Cases; 2 Cases Eventually Required Surgical Extraction. Minor Complications  Occurred In 11 Endoscopies. There Were No Deaths Or Perforations. The Total  Estimated Costs Were \$2,018,073 (\$1,500,627 In Hospital Costs, \$240,640 In  Physician Fees, And \$276,806 For Security Services). Costs Were Significantly  Higher For Inpatients. Major Payers Were Medicare (48\%) And Medicaid (31\%).  Conclusions: Intentional Fb Ingestion Occurs Among A Relatively Small Number Of  Patients With Psychiatric Disorders And Is Costly. Endoscopic Retrieval Is  Relatively Effective And Safe, But Often Requires General Anesthesia. These Cases  Utilize Significant Hospital And Fiscal Resources. Attention Should Be Focused On  Preventing These Recurrent And Costly Episodes.},

Paediatric Gi Endoscopy Is A Core Competency Every Paediatric  Gastroenterologist Should Possess, And Represents One Of The Most Common  Procedures Performed In Children For Both Diagnostic And Therapeutic Purposes.  Yet There Remains A Dearth Of Literature On The Utility And Outcomes Of  Paediatric Gi Endoscopy In The Asia-Pacific Region. Data On The Diagnostic Value  Of Paediatric Gi Endoscopy Would Be An Important Aspect Of Discussion, With The  Emergence Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ibd) And Eosinophilic Gi Disease As  Increasingly Common Endoscopic Diagnoses. Time-Based Trends In Paediatric Gi  Endoscopy Do Point Towards More Ibd And Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Related  Complications Being Diagnosed, With A Declining Incidence Of Gi Bleeding.  However, The Real-World Diagnostic Value Of Endoscopy In Asia Must Be  Contextualised To The Region-Specific Prevalence Of Paediatric Gi Diseases.  Helicobacter Pylori Infection, Particularly That Of Multidrug-Resistant Strains,  Remains A Highly Prevalent Problem In Specific Regions. Paediatric Functional Gi  Disorders Still Account For The Majority Of Childhood Gi Complaints In Most  Centres, Hence The Diagnostic Yield Of Endoscopy Should Be Critically Evaluated  In The Absence Of Alarm Symptoms. Gi Therapeutic Endoscopy Is Also Occasionally  Required For Children With Ingested Foreign Bodies, Intestinal Polyposis Or  Oesophageal Strictures Requiring Dilation. Endoscopic Haemostasis Is A  Potentially Life-Saving Skill In Cases Of Massive Gi Bleeding Typically From  Varices Or Peptic Ulcers. Advanced Endoscopic Techniques Such As Capsule  Endoscopy And Balloon-Assisted Enteroscopy Have Found Traction, Particularly In  East Asian Centres, As Invaluable Diagnostic And Therapeutic Tools In The  Management Of Ibd, Obscure Gi Bleeding And Intestinal Polyposis. State Of The Art  Endoscopic Diagnostics And Therapeutics, Including The Use Of Artificial  Intelligence-Aided Endoscopy Algorithms, Real-Time Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy  And Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy, Are Expected To Gain More Utility In Paediatrics.  As Paediatric Gastroenterology Matures As A Subspecialty In Asia, It Is Essential  Current Paediatric Endoscopists And Future Trainees Adhere To Minimum Practice  Standards, And Keep Abreast Of The Evolving Trends In The Diagnostic And  Therapeutic Value Of Endoscopy.

  abstract = {Introduction: Intentional Ingestion Of Foreign Objects (Iifo) Is Prevalent Among U.S. Prisoners. Iifos Often Require Surgical Or Endoscopic Interventions, Extended Hospital Stays, And May Result In Significant Morbidity Or Even Mortality. Although Psychiatric Illness Is Prevalent Among Prisoners Engaging In Iifo, This Association Remains Poorly Defined. The Aim Of This Study Is To Describe The Psychiatric Illness Profile Among Prisoners Diagnosed With Iifo. We Hypothesized That Repeated Episodes Of Iifo Are Associated With An Escalating Pattern Of Documented Psychiatric Illness. Methods: After Approvals Were Obtained From Our Institutional Review Board And The Ohio Department Of Rehabilitation And Correction, A Retrospective Study Was Conducted Of Prisoners Presenting To Our Facility With Iifo Between 2004 And 2011. All Historical And Concurrent Psychiatric Diagnoses Were Abstracted From The Medical Record And Classified Into Diagnostic And Statistical Manual Of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition Based Categories. In Addition, Medical History, Alcohol/Drug Use, And Prior Episodes Of Iifo Were Recorded. Statistical Analyses Included Chi-Square And Kruskal-Wallis Tests For Categorical And Continuous Data, Respectively. Results: We Analyzed 136 Iifo Episodes Involving 27 Patients. Repeat Iifo Episodes Were Associated With An Increasing Number Of Psychiatric Diagnoses. Patients With Their Fifth Or Later Iifo Had A Larger Number Of Psychiatric Diagnoses And The Number Of Objects Ingested As Compared To Patients Presenting With A First Episode (P {$<$} 0.01). Similarly, Patients Who Went On To Present With Additional Episodes Of Iifo During The Study Had More Psychiatric Diagnoses Identified Throughout Their Visits (P {$<$} 0.01). The Proportion Of Patients With Mood And Anxiety Disorders (Including Post-Traumatic Stress) Was Progressively Greater Among Prisoners With Recurrent Episodes Of Iifo (P {$<$} 0.05). Other Psychiatric Disorders Were Not Significantly Associated With Iifo Escalation. Conclusions: We Observed A Significant Association Between Iifo Recurrences And Increases In Both The Quantity Of Ingested Items And The Number Of Documented Psychiatric Diagnoses. Of Note, Psychiatric Diagnoses Of Malingering Or Secondary Gain Were Not Identified In The Current Patient Sample. Consideration Of Early Psychiatric Evaluation And Intervention In The Setting Of Iifo, Especially Recurrent Iifo, Is Strongly Encouraged. The Following Core Competencies Are Addressed In This Article: Medical Knowledge, Patient Care, Systems-Based Practice.},

Methods: Adult Patients With An  Endoscopic Record Of Attempted Foreign Body Retrieval Between January 2013 And  September 2020 Were Identified At Three Australian Hospitals. Those With A  Documented Mental Health Diagnosis Were Included And Their Standard Medical  Records Reviewed. Presentation History, Demographics, Comorbidities And  Endoscopic Findings Were Recorded And Described. Results: A Total Of 166  Admissions Were Accounted For By 35 Patients, 2/3 Of Which Had Borderline  Personality Disorder (Bpd). Repetitive Presentations Occurred In More Than Half  Of The Cohort. There Was An Increased Trend Of Hospital Admissions Throughout The  Years. At Least Half Of The Cohort Had A Documented Mental Health Review During  Their Admission. An Average Of 3.3 (2.9) Foreign Bodies Were Ingested Per Single  Episode. Endoscopic Intervention Was Performed In 76.5\% Of Incidents. The  Combined Length Of Stay For All Patients Was 680~Days. Conclusion: Deliberate  Foreign Body Ingestion In Mental Health Patients Is A Common, Recurring And  Challenging Problem That Is Increasing In Frequency And Requires Collaborative  Research To Further Guide Holistic Management.},

When Swallowed, Open Safety Pins Are Mostly Found Within The Esophagus Or Stomach, And  They Cannot Be Easily Removed By Rigid Esophagogastroscopy. Our Aim Was To  Evaluate The Removal Of Safety Pins Using Flexible Endoscopy In Infants.  Materials And Methods: We Evaluated The Cases Of 7 Infants Who Had Ingested Open  Safety Pins Between 2001 And 2004. In All The Patients, The Primary Diagnostic  Tool Was A Direct X-Ray Of The Neck, Chest, And Abdomen. In All Cases, The Safety  Pins Were Removed By Flexible Esophagogastroduo-Denoscopy. Clinical Records For  The Cases Were Reviewed. Results: Four Of The Open Safety Pins Were Lodged In The  Esophagus, Two In The Stomach, And One In The Duodenum. One Infant Had A Safety  Pin Lodged In The Esophagus With The Pin'S Open End Pointed Caudally; The Pin Was  Held With The Endoscopic Forceps By Its Tail End And Removed. Three Safety Pins  In The Esophagus Had Their Open Ends Pointing Cephalad; These Were Held By Their  Tail Ends Using The Endoscopic Forceps And Pushed Into The Stomach. Then They  Were Rotated In The Stomach And Removed Tail End First. The Safety Pins Located  In The Stomach Or Duodenum Were Also Removed Similarly. All Safety Pins Were  Successfully Removed, And There Were No Operative Complications. Conclusion: Open  Surgery Or Other Invasive Removal Methods Are Not Necessary In Infants With Open  Safety Pin Ingestions. In Our Opinion, The Best Way To Extract An Open Safety Pin  From The Esophagus, Stomach, Or Duodenum Is By Using A Flexible Endoscopic  Device.},

Design And Setting: Three  Hundred Patients Presenting With A History Of Either Aspirating Or Swallowing A  Foreign Body Were Analyzed In A Tertiary Care Center. Data Were Collected By  Retrospective Chart Review And Statistically Analyzed. Results: Of The 300  Patients Studied, 90\% (270 Cases) Did Have A Retained Foreign Body, With 233  (86.2\%) Cases Found In The Pharyngoesophagus And 37 (13.7\%) Cases In The  Tracheobronchial Tree. With Foreign Bodies In The Tracheobronchial Passages, The  Most Common Sign And Symptom Were Rhonchi (50\%) And Dyspnea (67\%), Respectively;  In Pharyngoesophagus, The Most Common Symptom And Sign Were Dysphagia (64\%) And  Odynophagia (45\%), Respectively. The Most Common Foreign Body Found Was Fish Bone  In 39\% (106 Cases) And The Most Common Site Of Lodgment Was The Cervical  Esophagus 50.5\% (136 Cases). Rigid Endoscopy With Forceps Removal Under General  Anesthesia Was The Main Treatment Modality. Thirty-Three (12.2\%) Cases Had  Complications Secondary To Retained Foreign Body. Conclusion: Foreign Bodies In  The Aerodigestive Tract Continue To Be A Common Problem Affecting Adults And  Children Alike. Rigid Endoscopies With Forceps Removal Under General Anesthesia  Are The Preferred Management Modality. From Their Experience, The Authors  Recommend That No Foreign Body In The Upper Aerodigestive Tract Should Be Left  Alone With The Hope That It Will Come Out Spontaneously.

The Vast Majority Of Pediatric Ingestions Are  Accidental; Increasing Incidence Of Intentional Ingestions Starts In The  Adolescent Age Group. In The United States, The Most Common Pediatric Foreign  Bodies Ingested Are Coins, Followed By A Variety Of Other Objects, Including  Toys, Toy Parts, Sharp Objects, Batteries, Bones, And Food. In Adolescents And  Adults, Meat Or Food Impactions Are The Most Common Accidental Foreign Body  Ingestion. Esophageal Pathology Underlies Most Cases Of Food Impaction.  Management Of Foreign Body Ingestions Varies Based On The Object Ingested, Its  Location, And The Patient'S Age And Size. Esophageal Foreign Bodies As A Group  Require Early Intervention Because Of Their Potential To Cause Respiratory  Symptoms And Complications, Esophageal Erosions, Or Even An Aortoesophageal  Fistula. Ingested Batteries That Lodge In The Esophagus Require Urgent Endoscopic  Removal Even In The Asymptomatic Patient Due To The High Risk Of Complications.  Sharp Foreign Bodies Increase The Foreign Body Complication Rate From Less Than  1\% To 15\% To 35\%, Except For Straight Pins, Which Usually Follow A Relatively  Benign Course Unless Multiple Pins Are Ingested. Magnets Are Increasingly  Ingested, Due To Their Ubiquitous Nature And The Perception That They Do Not Pose  A Risk. Ingestion Of Multiple Magnets Creates A Significant Risk Of Obstruction,  Perforation, And Fistula Development.

Patients: Nine Patients Presenting With Aef Were Observed Between May 1988 And April 2002. There Were 4 Men And 5 Women With A Mean Age Of 54.3 Years (Range, 32-77 Years). Six Patients Presented Secondary Aef After Aortic Repair. Two Patients Presented Primary Aef After Rupture Of An Atherosclerotic Aneurysm Into The Esophagus. In The Remaining Patient, Aef Was Caused By Swallowing A Fishbone. In 6 Cases Involving True Aef With A Direct Communication Between The Aorta And Esophagus, Massive Exsanguinating Hematemesis Occurred. It Was Usually Preceded By Minor Sentinel Bleeding, Two Patients Presented Esophagoparaprosthetic Fistula (Eppf). One Patient Presented Primary Aef That Was Contained By A Large Thrombus In The Communication. The Clinical Picture In These 3 Patients Involved Severe Sepsis Without Hemorrhage. Results: Two Patients Died As A Result Of Massive Hemorrhage Before Assessment And Surgical Treatment Could Be Undertaken. One 77-Year-Old Woman Presenting Eppf Refused To Undergo Surgery And Died Because Of Infection. The Remaining 6 Patients Underwent Surgical Treatment With Various Outcomes. One Man Died During Thoracotomy Caused By Exsanguinating Hemorrhage. One Woman Presenting Eppf Was Treated By Exclusion Followed By Ascending Aorta To Abdominal Aorta Bypass Grafting, Removal Of The Prosthesis, Esophageal Exclusion, And Directed Esophageal Fistula. She Died Of Infection. The Other 4 Patients Were Treated By In Situ Aortic Allograft Replacement. The Damaged Esophagus Was Repaired By Using The Tha1 Technique In 1 Patient. In The Remaining 3 Cases Subtotal Esophagectomy Was Performed In Association With Cervical Esophagostomy, Ligation Of The Abdominal Esophagus, Gastrostomy, And Jejunostomy. One Patient Died Of Sepsis During The First 24 Hours After The Operation. The Other 3 Patients Underwent Secondary Esophagoplasty And Survived With No Further Sign Of Infection. Mean Duration Of Follow-Up In The Survivor Group Was 53 Months (Range, 15-95 Months). Overall 6 Patients, Including 3 That Did Not Undergo Surgical Treatment, Died And 3 Patients Survived. Conclusion: Our Experience Confirms That Aef Is A Rare But Catastrophic Disorder. In Situ Allograft Replacement Usually In Association With Subtotal Esophagectomy Appears To Be An Excellent Salvage Modality Whenever Emergency Surgery Is Feasible.},

Interobserver Agreement Was Greater For Iterative Reconstruction (Icc = 0.944) Than For Fbp (Icc = 0.778). Conclusion. Ultralow-Dose Chest Ct Using Iterative Reconstruction Provided Satisfactory Diagnostic Image Quality For Identifying Fish Bone Esophageal Fb With Reduced Radiation Dose And High Observer Accuracy. Therefore, Ultralow-Dose Chest Ct Would Be Adequate As A First-Line Imaging Modality For Fish Bone Esophageal Fb.},

Intentional ingestion of foreign bodies in adults is typically associated with psychiatric disorders or developmental delay. In most cases, foreign bodies pass spontaneously through the gastrointestinal tract or can be managed endoscopically. Rarely, surgical intervention~is indicated. We present a unique case of surgical management of an intentionally ingested vape device that was chronically impacted within the duodenum of an adult male present for six weeks before intervention without associated perforation. The foreign object was removed via exploratory laparotomy with duodenotomy and primary duodenorrhaphy with an uncomplicated postoperative course. There are only two previously reported cases of an ingested vape device. One was managed by observation, and the other was removed endoscopically. There are no previously reported cases of an ingested vape device that required surgical management.},

Patients And Methods: Between July 1988 And  May 1996, 11 Patients With Large Gastric Bezoars, Defined As Those Greater Than 5  Cm In Diameter, Received Endoscopic-Guided Fragmentation Using Electrohydraulic  Lithotripsy. Nine Of Our Patients Had A History Of Ingestion Of "Pho Pu Zi",  (Cordia Dichotoma Frost. F.), One Of Orange Pitch, And One Of Ingestion Of  Persimmon. Results: The 11 Patients In The Study Underwent Ehl For The Treatment  Of Their Gastric Bezoars, With A 100\% Success Rate, Which Was Defined As The Lack  Of Residual Bezoar Seen On Post-Procedure Barium Study Or Endoscopy Done 2 Days  After The Procedure. Patients Were Followed-Up Clinically For 30-68 Months, With  Seven Of The 11 Patients Undergoing A Barium Study With No Residual Bezoar Noted.  No Procedure-Related Complications Were Seen, Except For Pharyngeal Pain Which  Was Most Probably Secondary To The Placement Of The Silicon Overtube.  Conclusions: Endoscopically Guided Electrohydraulic Lithotripsy Is A Safe, Highly  Effective, Alternative Nonsurgical Technique For The Treatment Of Gastric  Bezoars.},

Self-Harm And Suicide Are Associated With Particular Injuries And Patterns Of Injury. Many Of These Patterns Are Apparent On Imaging. Self-Harm Or Suicidal Intent May Be Overlooked Initially In Such Cases, Particularly When The Patient Is Unconscious Or Uncooperative. Correct Identification Of These Findings By The Radiologist Will Allow A Patient'S Management To Be Tailored Accordingly And May Prevent Future Suicide Attempts. The Initial Role Of The Radiologists In These Cases Is To Identify Life-Threatening Injuries That Require Urgent Medical Attention. The Radiologist Can Add Value By Drawing Attention To Associated Injuries, Which May Have Been Missed On Initial Clinical Assessment. In Many Cases Of Self-Harm And Suicide, Imaging Is More Reliable Than Clinical Assessment. The Radiologist May Be Able To Provide Important Prognostic Information That Allows Clinicians To Manage Expectations And Plan Appropriately. Furthermore, Some Imaging Studies Will Provide Essential Forensic Information. Unfortunately, Many Cases Of Attempted Suicide Will End In Brain Death. The Radiologist May Have A Role In These Cases In Identifying Evidence Of Hypoxic--Ischaemic Brain Injury, Confirming A Diagnosis Of Brain Death Through Judicious Use Of Ancillary Tests And, Finally, In Donor Screening For Organ Transplantation.

Methods:  The Medical Records Of 249 Patients Who Ingested Fbs Were Reviewed. In Addition,  They Were Studied By Telephone Questionnaires To Follow Up Spontaneously Passed  Fb. The Factors Associated With Sp Such As Age, The Type, Size, And Initial  Location Of The Fbs Were Analyzed. Results: Foreign Bodies Were Spontaneously  Passed In 145 Patients (58.2\%), Endoscopic Removal Was Performed In 100 Patients  (40.2\%), And Operative Removal Was Performed In 4 Patients (1.6\%). Most Sp Fbs  Were Passed Within 5 Days. The Sp Rates (Sprs) According To The Initial Location  Were The Following: 12.2\% For The Esophagus (P{$<$}0.0001), 71.4\% For The Stomach,  85.7\% For The Small Bowel, And 96.4\% For The Colon. There Was No Significant  Difference In The Spr According To Age. When Coins And Disk Batteries That  Required Early Endoscopic Removal Were Excluded, The Spr Was 63.4\% For Fbs Less  Than 10 Mm, 80.4\% For Fbs 10 To 20 Mm, 72.8\% For Fbs 20 To 30 Mm, And 50.0\% For  Fbs More Than 30 Mm (P=0.091).

Bowel Perforation By Foreign Body Ingestion Has Been Believed To Be Relatively Rare, And Most Commonly Caused By Fish Bones, Chicken Bones, And Toothpicks. Our Clinical Experience, However, Suggests Such Perforations May Be More Common Than Previously Thought, And Caused By Various Other Objects As Well. Medical Records Of All Patients Diagnosed With Foreign Body-Induced Intestinal Perforation, From The Department Of General Surgery At Tonji Hospital, From January 2000 To June 2015, Were Retrospectively Analyzed. A Total Of 17 Men And 8 Women Suffered Intestinal Perforations By Ingestion Of Dietary Foreign Bodies. Among The 25 Total Patients, 4 Ingested Foreign Bodies Intentionally, Whereas The Other 21 Cases Were Accidental. The Foreign Bodies Were Identified By Plain X-Ray Film In 2 Patients (2 Cases Of Needles) And By Multidetector Computed Tomography (Mdct) In 11 Patients (6 Cases Of Date Stones, 3 Cases Of Metallic Objects, And 2 Cases Of Bone Fragments), Thus Supporting The Correct Preoperative Diagnosis (13 Cases; 52\%). The Most Common Location Of The Perforation Was The Terminal Ileum (N = 17). The Offending Objects Were Date Stones (N = 13), Bones (N = 7), And Metallic Objects (N = 5). The Most Common Treatment Was Removal Of The Foreign Body And Closure Of The Perforation With Simple Suture (N = 22). Ten Patients Were Treated Laparoscopically. The Present Study Shows That The Most Common Foreign Bodies Causing Intestinal Perforation Are Date Stones And Bones. Although About 50\% Of The Foreign Bodies Could Be Identified By Mdct, Definite Diagnosis Remained Preoperatively Difficult. Consequently, Because Of High Misdiagnosis Rates, Laparoscopy May Be The Optimal Choice For Diagnosis And Treatment Of Bowel Perforation By Foreign Bodies.},

  abstract = {Background: About 90\% Of Perianal Infection Is Caused By Cryptoglandular Infection. Only A Few Cases Of Peritonitis Or Intra-Abdominal Abscesses Secondary  To Perforation Of The Digestive Tract By An Ingested Foreign Body Have Been  Reported. The Most Common Sites Of Impaction And Perforation Include The  Appendix, Cecum And The Terminal Ileum. The Rectum Is An Unusual Site Of Foreign  Body Impaction. This Report Intends To Highlight That Ingested Foreign Body  Impacted In The Rectum Is An Extremely Rare Cause Of Perianal Abscess And  Subsequent Fistula In Infants. Case Summary: Two Cases Of Perianal Abscess And  Fistula Due To Ingested Jujube Pit Impacted In The Rectum Are Reported. Both  Cases Are Infants With Free Previous Medical History Suffered From Recurrent  Perianal Infection. The Caregivers Of The Two Patients Denied Ingestion Of A  Foreign Body Or Any History Of Trauma. Physical Examination Combined With  Ultrasound Or Computed Tomography Scan Established The Diagnosis. Both Of The  Patients Underwent Operation Under General Anesthesia. In Case 1, A Jujube Pit  With Sharp Ends Was Discovered Embedded Within A Subcutaneous Fistula. The Jujube  Pit Was Then Removed Intact Along With Fistula Resection. The Wound Was  Successfully Laid Open To Allow Healing By Secondary Intention. In Case 2, A  Jujube Pit Was Found With Its Sharp End Puncturing The Rectum, Surrounded By Pus  And Necrotic Tissue. Subsequent Incision And Adequate Drainage Were Performed.  The Whole Jujube Pit Was Then Removed From The Abscess Cavity At The Same Time.  Both Patients Received Colonoscopy To Rule Out Inflammatory Bowel Disease Or  Other Potential Damages By The Ingested Jujube Pit. The Postoperative Period Was  Uneventful. At 1.5 Year Follow-Up, No Recurrent Abscess Or Fistula Were Found In  Either Patient. Conclusion: An Impacted Foreign Body Must Not Be Overlooked As An  Unusual Cause Of Perianal Abscess And Fistula, Especially In Young Children.},

This Review Will Focus On  The Clinical Presentation And Complications Of These Two Common Inadvertent  Ingestions In Children, As Well As Recent Regulatory Efforts And Advocacy  Opportunities. Recent Findings: The Rising Incidence Of Cannabis Toxicity In  Children Has Corresponded With Its Legalization Across Several Countries In The  Last Decade. Inadvertent Pediatric Cannabis Intoxication Is Most Commonly Due To  The Ingestion Of Edible Forms Discovered By Children In Their Own Home. The  Clinical Presentation Can Be Nonspecific, Therefore Clinicians Should Have A Low  Threshold For Including It On Their Differential Diagnosis. Button Battery  Ingestions Are Also Increasing In Incidence. While Many Children Are Asymptomatic  At Presentation, Button Battery Ingestions Can Quickly Cause Esophageal Injury  And Lead To Several Serious And Potentially Life-Threatening Complications.  Prompt Recognition And Removal Of Esophageal Button Batteries Is Essential For  Reducing Harm. Summary: Cannabis And Button Battery Ingestions Are Important For  Physicians Who Take Care Of Children To Recognize And Manage Appropriately. Given  Their Rising Incidence, There Are Many Opportunities For Policy Improvements And  Advocacy Efforts To Make A Difference In Preventing These Ingestions Altogether.},

With Its Branches Squeezed To Lie Parallel, The Cross  Is Wrapped Into A Small Strip Of Paper And Ingested. After Being Released From  Its Wrapper, The Branches Of The Cross Spring Back To Their Original Position And  Cause Perforation Of The Bowel Wall. Design: Case Series. Setting: University  Hospital, Bulgaria. Patients: Five Male Prisoners From The Same Jail Undergoing  Laparotomy For Foreign Body Removal During 1 Week In January 1994. Interventions:  Laparotomy, Removal Of The Foreign Bodies Through Incisions Of The Bowel Wall,  Immediate Restoration Of The Gastrointestinal Tract Continuity, And Peritoneal  Lavage And Drainage. Outcome Measures: Morbidity And Mortality. Results: Two Of  The Patients Were Initially Observed But Subsequently Underwent Surgery For  Perforations Of The Gastrointestinal Tract. Three Of The Patients Underwent  Immediate Operative Treatment. There Were 20 Total Crosses Ingested; All Foreign  Objects Impacted And Perforated The Stomach (50\%), First Duodenal Portion (25\%),  And Fourth Duodenal Portion (20\%). There Was No Morbidity Or Mortality Among The  Five Patients Treated. Conclusions: Because Ingested Crosses That Have Been  Released From Their Wrappers Never Move Distally, The Only Definitive Solution Is  To Operate Early.},

Methods: Retrospective Chart Review Was Performed. Patients Were Identified Using  Icd-9 Code For Esophageal Foreign Body. Clinical Data And Management Techniques,  Along With Complications Were Abstracted. Results: For The 5-Year Period Of  Review, 255 Patients Were Identified With An Esophageal Foreign Body. 214  Children Had A Witnessed Ingestion. The Mean Age Of The Unwitnessed Ingestion  Group Was 2.3 Years, Compared To 4.6 Years For A Witnessed Ingestion. In Both  Groups, Males And Females Were Distributed Equally And The Most Common Ingested  Object Was A Coin. Bivariate, Unadjusted Analysis Revealed That History Of Wheeze  (Or, 4.35) And Fever (Or, 11.15) Had The Largest Association With Patients Who  Had An Unwitnessed Ingestion. Multivariate Analysis Indicated That Any Physical  Findings Of Wheeze, Rhonchi, Stridor, Or Retractions Were Associated  Significantly With A Diagnosis Of An Unwitnessed Foreign Body. Children Less Than  2 Years Of Age And With A Documented Fever Are Also Predictive Of An Unwitnessed  Ingestion. Eleven Children (4.3\%) With Esophageal Abnormalities Were Also Noted  To Have Foreign Bodies. Conclusions: Children Who Present To The Emergency  Department Two Years Old And Younger, Who Have A Documented Fever And With  Respiratory Findings Should Be Considered At Risk For Having A Retained  Esophageal Foreign Body.

Materials And Methods: Forty-Two Patients With A History Of Sharp Or  Pointed Foreign Body Ingestion Were Reviewed Retrospectively. Two Observers  Interpreted The Ct And The Conventional Radiography Datasets Separately. If A  Foreign Body Was Directly Identified, It Was Regarded As A Positive Finding. Even  If No High-Density Foreign Body Was Found, Detection Of A Secondary Finding Was  Considered To Be A Positive Finding. Diagnostic Performance Of Mdct And  Conventional Radiography Were Compared According To Esophageal Level. Final  Diagnosis Was Made By Esophagoscopy Or Surgery In Addition To The  Clinicoradiologic Result. Results: Mdct Was Statistically Superior To  Conventional Radiography For Diagnosis Of A Thoracic Esophageal Foreign Body For  Both Observers (P {$<$} 0.001 For Each). No Significant Difference In Sensitivity  Between Ct And Conventional Radiography For Diagnosis Of Cervical Esophageal  Foreign Body Was Noted Regardless Of Observer. Both Observers Could Identify All  Complicated Conditions With Mdct Regardless Of Esophageal Level. However, In Two  Of Three Cases Of Complicated Thoracic Esophageal Foreign Bodies, Neither  Observer Could Detect Foreign Bodies On Conventional Radiography; Furthermore,  The Observers Could Not Identify Pneumomediastinum. Conclusion: In Cases Of Sharp  Or Pointed Foreign Body Ingestion, If The Result Of An Initial Inspection Of Oro-  And Hypopharynx Reveals Negative Findings, The First Imaging Modality Should Be  Mdct For Better Diagnosis And Management.},

Risk  Factors For Rifb Ingestion Include Male Sex, Incarceration, And The Presence Of A  Psychiatric Disorder. Most Patients Can Be Managed With Observation And  Endoscopy. Surgery Is Indicated In Cases Involving Perforation Or Obstruction.  The Literature On Preventative Strategies For Rifb Ingestion Is Scarce. Case  Report A 23-Year-Old Man Required 6 Admissions In 1 Calendar Year For Intentional  Foreign Body Ingestions. The Patient Was Living In Prison And Had A History Of  Bipolar I Disorder, Schizophrenia, And Borderline Personality Disorder. He  Underwent 9 Endoscopic Procedures That Retrieved A Total Of 64 Objects. The  Primary Imaging Modalities Were Abdominal X-Ray And Abdominopelvic  Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography Scan. The Patient Was Managed With  Endoscopy And, In 2 Cases, With Observation Alone. Serial Abdominal Examinations  And Abdominal Films Were Used To Monitor The Progress Of Foreign Bodies That Were  Difficult To Retrieve. A Bowel Regimen With Polyethylene Glycol Facilitated The  Passage Of The Objects. The Patient Never Required Surgical Intervention. The  Mean Length Of Stay Was 4.17 Days. The Recurrent Ingestions May Have Been Related  To Compulsions And Family Stress. Conclusions Interdisciplinary Collaboration Is  Paramount In Formulating Effective Treatment Plans And Limiting Recurrence.  Proposed Strategies To Prevent Rifb Ingestion Include The Removal Of Ingestible  Objects From The Environment, Specialized Prison Units For Close Monitoring,  Early Psychiatric Intervention With Appropriate Pharmacologic/Behavioral Therapy,  And Limiting Hospital Admissions To Prevent Secondary Gain. Further Studies Are  Needed To Determine The Most Effective Approach To Manage And Prevent Rifb  Ingestion.},

Materials And Methods: Our Retrospective And Descriptive Study Focused' On 13 Inmates Having Ingested' 47 Foreign Bodies And Who Consulted The Emergency Of Our Department Over A 5-Year Period From January 2018 To July 2023. Results: The Study Population Consisted Of 12 Men And One Woman With An Average Age Of 32 Years (24 Years-47 Years). Foreign Bodies Ingested By Inmates Were Dominated By Batteries (59.52\%) Followed By Lighters (19.04\%). The Majorit{\'y} Of Foreign Bodies Were, At The Time Of Discovery, Located Mainly In The Stomach (6 Cases) And Colon (4 Cases). Ingestion Resulted In Epigastric Pain (3 Cases), Externalized Gastrointestinal Bleeding With Epigastralgia (2 Cases), And No Symptoms (8 Cases). Of The 13 Cases Of Foreign Body Ingestion, 6 Patients Underwent Endoscopic Extraction In The Gastroenterology Department. Extraction Was By Diathermic Loop, Dormia Loop And Endoscopic Basket. Successful Extraction Was Achieved In 4 Cases (66.66\%), And Unsuccessful Extraction In 2 Cases (33.33\%). Only One Inmate Required Surgical Extraction, And In 6 Patients The Elimination Of Foreign Bodies In The Stool Was Spontaneous Under Medical Supervision. Conclusion: Foreign Body Ingestion Is Frequent And Voluntary In The Prison Environment. It Is Characterized By The Multiplicity Of Foreign Bodies. The Rate Of Successful Extraction Of Ingested Foreign Bodies In Our Practice Is Satisfactory, Requiring An Experienced Endoscopist To Perform The Extraction Without Complications And Avoid Recourse To Surgery.

Although Point-Of-Care Ultrasound (Pocus) Has Increasingly  Been Integrated Into The Daily Practice Of Emergency Medicine, It Has Been Poorly  Investigated In The Diagnostic Approach For Fbi.This Review Aims To Highlight The  Current State Of Pocus Use For Pediatric Fbi.The Following Research Question Was  Considered In This Narrative Review: Is Pocus Useful For Fbi Management? Methods:  A Literature Search Was Conducted To Identify Articles Reporting Pocus Use For  The Management Of Fbi. All Articles Were Assessed For Quality By 2 Reviewers.  Main Results: The 14 Selected Articles Reported 52 Fbi Cases In Which Pocus  Successfully Identified And Located The Ingested Fb. Point-Of-Care Ultrasound Was  Used Either As The Primary Imaging Technique Or After Positive Or Negative X-Ray  Findings. In 5 Cases (9.6\%), Pocus Was The Only Modality Used For The Diagnosis.  Of These Cases, 3 (60\%) Underwent A Successful Procedure To Remove The Fb And 2  (40\%) Received Conservative Treatment Without Complications. Conclusions: This  Review Suggests That Pocus Might Be A Reliable Modality For The Initial  Management Of Fbi. Pocus Can Locate, Identify, And Evaluate The Size Of The Fb In  A Wide Range Of Materials And Gastrointestinal Locations. Point-Of-Care  Ultrasound Could Eventually Become The Go-To Modality In The Case Of Radiolucent  Fb, Thus Avoiding The Use Of Radiation. Further Studies Are Nevertheless Required  To Validate Pocus Use For Fbi Management.},

Causes Of Esophageal Injury  Include Iatrogenic (Including Esophagogastroduodenoscopy And Stent Placement),  Foreign Body Ingestion, Blunt Or Penetrating Trauma To The Chest Or Abdomen, And  Forceful Retching, Also Called Boerhaave Syndrome. Although Fluoroscopic  Esophagography Remains The Imaging Study Of Choice According The American College  Of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria, Ct Esophagography Has Been Shown To Be At  Least Equal To If Not Superior To Fluoroscopic Evaluation For Esophageal Injury.  In Addition, Ct Esophagography Allows Diagnosis Of Extraesophageal Abnormalities,  Both As The Cause Of The Patient'S Symptoms As Well As Incidental Findings. Ct  Esophagography Also Allows Rapid Diagnosis Since The Examination Can Be Readily  Performed In Most Clinical Settings And Requires No Direct Radiologist  Supervision, Requiring Only Properly Trained Technologists And A Ct Scanner.  Multiple Prior Studies Have Shown The Limited Utility Of Fluoroscopic  Esophagography After A Negative Chest Ct Scan And The Increase In Accuracy After  Adding Oral Contrast Agent To Ct Examinations, Although There Is Considerable  Variability Of Ct Esophagography Protocols Among Institutions. Development Of A  Ct Esophagography Program, Utilizing A Well-Defined Protocol With Input From  Staff From The Radiology, Gastroenterology, Emergency, And General Surgery  Departments, Can Facilitate More Rapid Diagnosis And Patient Care, Especially In  Overnight And Emergency Settings.

Our Previous Research Examined Determinants Of Hospital Admission, Endoscopy, And Surgery Among Prisoners Who Ingest Foreign Objects. However, Little Is Known About The Financial Impact Of These Events On Healthcare Facilities That Service The Prisoner Population. This Study Aims To Fill This Gap By Examining Hospital Charges Attributable To 435 Prisoner Episodes Of Iifo. Methods: A Retrospective Review Of All Prisoners Who Presented To Our Medical Center With The Complaint Of Iifo Was Conducted. Both Institutional Review Board And Bureau Of Prisons Approvals Were Obtained Before Data Collection. All Prisoners Ages 18-75 Were Included Between The Dates Of January 2004 And December 2011. Episodes Were Divided Into Three Categories: (A) Unverified Iifo Wherein Ingested Object Was Claimed By The Patient But Never Identified; (B) Verified Iifo Wherein Ingested Object Was Clearly Identified; (C) Secondary Events Due To Direct Complications Of Previous Iifo Episode (S). The Temporal Occurrence Of Iifo Was Organized By Increasing The Number Of Episodes And Grouped Accordingly. Detailed List Of Hospital Charges Was Obtained For Every Iifo Episode Including: (A) Emergency Services, (B) Procedures, (C) Laboratory, (D) Surgical Supplies, (E) Allied Health Services, (F) Radiology Studies, (G) Anesthesiology Charges, (H) Pharmacy, And (H) Intensive Care Costs. Descriptive Statistics Were Used To Analyze Basic Data. Kruskal-Wallis Test Was Used To Examine Differences Among Nonnormally Distributed Variables And Sub-Groups. Statistical Significance Set At Alpha = 0.05. Results: A Total Of 435 Iifo Episodes Occurred During The Study Period In A Population Of 125 Patients (Mean Age 33.8 +/- 11.7 Years, Median Age 34 [Range 19-75] Years, 92.8\% Male). Hospital Charges Associated With These Episodes Totaled \$6,209,557. There Were 94 Unverified Iifos, 332 Verified Iifos, And 9 Secondary Events. Verified Iifos Were Associated With Significantly Greater Median Charges (\$5,860) Than Unverified Iifos (\$3,997) And Secondary Events Carried Lower Cost (\$3,501) Than The Former Two (P {$<$} 0.01). We Also Observed A Pattern Of Escalating Costs Associated With Increasing Number Of Sequential Iifo Episodes, With The 1St Episode Carrying Median Charges Of \$4,683 And Episodes Numbered 11+ Carrying Median Charges Of \$7,698 (P {$<$} 0.01). Conclusions: Hospital Charges Associated With The Care Of Prisoners Who Ingest Foreign Objects Tend To Escalate Over Time. Although Charges In Most Of The Categories Demonstrated Increases With Greater Numbers Of Ingestions, The Largest Contributors To This Pattern Of Escalating Charges Included Radiology, Pharmacy, Hospital Room Charges, And Surgical Services. These Findings Suggest That Early Intervention In The Destructive Cycle Of Iifo May Not Only Improve Patient Outcomes But Also Result In Savings To The Healthcare System.

Purpose: To Investigate The Efficacy Of 64-Slice  Multidetector Computed Tomography (Mdct) For The Evaluation Of Pharynx And Upper  Esophageal Fb Foreign Bodies. Material And Methods: Sixty-Six Patients With  Suspected Fb Foreign Body Ingestion Were Examined By Plain Radiography (N\,=\,40)  And Unenhanced Mdct (N\,=\,66). We Analyzed The Presence, Location, Size, Shape,  And Lying Position Of The Foreign Bodies. Results: On Mdct, 46 Foreign Bodies  Were Detected. Among Them, 45 Were Confirmed By Endoscopy. The Sensitivity Of  Mdct For The Detection Of Foreign Bodies Was 100\%, Which Was Superior To That Of  The Plain Radiography (51.7\%). The Location Of The Foreign Bodies Was Most Common  In The Upper Esophagus (N\,=\,22, 47.8\%), Followed By Pharyngoesophageal Junction  (N\,=\,10, 21.7\%), Transjunctional (N\,=\,7, 15.2\%), Hypopharynx (N\,=\,5, 10.9\%), And  Oropharynx (N\,=\,2, 4.3\%). Their Longest Length Was 5.3-40.1\,Mm (Mean, 21.3\,Mm).  Thirty-Three Fbs (71.7\%) Were Linear And 13 (28.3\%) Were Flat In Shape. They  Showed Transverse (N\,=\,23, 50.0\%), Parallel (N\,=\,13, 28.3\%), And Oblique  Positions (N\,=\,10, 21.7\%) To The Long Axis Of The Pharynx And Esophagus,  Respectively. Conclusion: Mdct Is Useful For The Evaluation Of The Pharynx And  Upper Esophageal Fb Foreign Bodies.},

The Probability Of Injury Occurrence Is Influenced By  Agent, Host And Environmental Factors. Studies Of Repeat Injuries In Childhood  Therefore Provide Insight Into Factors In The Epidemiological Triad Predisposing  Children To Injury. Objectives: To Determine The Proportion Of Children And The  Factors Associated With Repeat Presentations To The Red Cross War Memorial  Children'S Hospital Trauma Unit (Rcwmch Tu) In Cape Town, South Africa, For All  Non-Transport-Related Injuries In Childhood. Methods: This Was A Retrospective  Cohort Study Using Data From The Rcwmch Tu. We Included Children Aged 0 - 10  Years With First Presentation From January 1997 To June 2013 And Followed Up  Until The Earlier Of Age 13 Years Or June 2016. We Assessed Individual And  Population-Level Factors Associated With Repeat Injury Using Multilevel Poisson  Regression Analysis. Child Dependency Ratios Were Derived From The 2011 National  Census. Results: Between 1997 And 2013, 72 490 Children Aged \&Lt;10 Years (59\%  Male) Presented To The Rcwmch Tu For The First Time With Injuries. After The  Initial Injury, 9 417 (13\%) Presented With A Repeat Injury By 2016 And Before Age  13 Years. After Adjusting For Health Subdistrict, Distance From Rcwmch Tu And Age  At First Presentation, Factors Associated With Reduced Repeat Presentation Were  Injury Identified As Due To Abuse (Adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio (Airr) 0.6; 95\%  Confidence Interval (Ci) 0.4 - 0.7), Fluid Burn (Airr 0.6; 95\% Ci 0.6 - 0.7),  Foreign Body Ingestion (Airr 0.7; 95\% Ci 0.7 - 0.9), And Moderate And Severe (V.  Minor) Initial Injury (Airr 0.9; 95\% Ci 0.8 - 0.9 And Airr 0.7; 95\% Ci 0.6 - 0.8,  Respectively), While Boys Were More Likely To Have Repeat Injury Presentations  (Airr 1.4; 95\% Ci 1.4 - 1.5). Conclusions: Repeat Presentations Were Substantial  And Associated With Male Gender. They Occurred Less Commonly After Fluid Burn  Injuries, Foreign Body Ingestion And Moderate To Severe Injuries. Children With  Intentional Injuries Were Also Less Likely To Have A Repeat Presentation. Further  Research Is Indicated For Childhood Injuries With Greater Propensity To Repeat,  Including Non-Height Falls And Sport-Related Injuries. Secondary Injury  Prevention Education Should Not Neglect Patients With Unintentional And Minor  Injuries. These Results Strengthen The Hypothesis That Injuries Arise As A Result  Of Sustained Exposure To Agent, Host And Environmental Risk Factors.},

Method: A Literature Review Was Performed Addressing The Presentation, Management  And Prevention Of Reoccurrences Of Dfbi. Four Cases Of Dfbi Are Presented  Illustrating Those Psychiatric Diagnoses (Psychosis, Malingering,  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder And Borderline Personality Disorder) Most  Frequently Encountered In Hospital Practice. Both Broad And Specific Treatment  Approaches Are Presented. Results: Patients Engaging In Dfbi Are Best Managed  Through A Multidisciplinary Approach, Following Acute Medical Management.

Methods: Retrospective Chart Review (Jan 2000-Feb 2018) Recruiting Children With  Impacted Esophageal Fbs. Fbs In Cricopharynx And Those That Moved To Stomach Were  Excluded. Investigations/Management Were Based On Underlying Anatomical  Pathology, Duration Of Impaction, And Difficult Fbs. Clinical Details,  Management, And Outcomes Were Collated. Results: Of 86 Children, N1\,=\,31 Had  Identifiable Predisposing Anatomic Pathology And N2\,=\,55 Had Impactions In Normal  Esophagus Or Difficult Fbs.

Case Report: We Present The Case Of A Patient Who  Had Swallowed A Safety Needle Which Could Safely Be Removed From The Jejunum By  Means Of Double-Balloon Enteroscopy (Dbe). The Combination Of A Thin P-Type  Enteroscope With A Thick T-Type Overtube Was Used In Order To Improve The  Manoeuvrability Of The Endoscope. The Needle Was Pulled Into The Overtube Which  Served As A Protective Shield During The Retrieval Of The Endoscope. Conclusion:  Our Case Report Describes The Potential Of Removing Foreign Bodies From The Deep  Small Bowel By Pulling Them Into The Overtube Of A Double-Balloon Enteroscope. If  The Suspicion Of Foreign Body Impaction In The Small Bowel Is Made, It May Be  Advisable To Primarily Choose A Balloon Enteroscopy System.

  abstract = {Objective. The Purpose Of This Study Was To Evaluate Findings At Serial Mri After Endoscopic Removal Of A Button Battery From The Esophagus In A Series Of  Pediatric Patients. Materials And Methods. Serial Mri Examinations After Removal  Of A Button Battery From The Esophagus Were Reviewed Retrospectively For The  Presence Of Mediastinal Edema; Imaging Characteristics Of The Aorta And Arteries;  Imaging Characteristics Of The Trachea; And Imaging Characteristics Of The  Esophageal Wall At The Level Of Injury. Results. A Total Of 48 Mri Examinations  Were Performed On 19 Patients, 89\% (17/19) In The First 48 Hours After Battery  Removal. Serial Mri Was Performed For 84\% (16/19) Of Patients. Initial Mri Showed  Extensive Mediastinal Edema In All 17 Patients Who Underwent Mri In The First 48  Hours. Edema Directly Abutted Major Arteries In All 17 Patients And Abutted The  Airway In All 10 Patients With Proximal Esophageal Injury. Arterial Vascular  Changes Were Seen In 30\% (3/10) Of Patients With Proximal Esophageal Injury And  57\% (4/7) Of Patients With Mid Or Distalesophageal Injury. Airway Changes Were  Seen In 80\% (8/10) Of Patients With Proximal Esophageal Injury. Serial Mri Showed  Improvement Of Airway Changes In All Patients And Improvement In Vessel Wall  Changes In All But One (25\%, 1/4) Of The Patients Who Had Mid Or Distal  Esophageal Injury. Four Patients (21\% [4/19]) Had Contained Esophageal Leak On  Esophagrams. No Patients In Our Series Developed A Tracheoesophageal Or  Vascular-Enteric Fistula. Conclusion. Our Case Series Provides Important  Information On Natural History Of Mri Findings In Children After Endoscopic  Removal Of A Button Battery From The Esophagus. Further Studies Are Needed To  Determine The Imaging Findings Most Sensitive And Specific For Severe  Complications, Such As Tracheoesophageal Fistula And Vascular-Enteric Fistula.},

Most Commonly, Fb Are Introduced Through The Anal Passage Or  Reach The Rectum After Oral Ingestion. We Describe Our Experience In The  Diagnosis And Treatment Of Fb Retained In The Rectum. Method: From 1997 To 2004,  Data Were Collected Prospectively In 30 Patients (20 Men And 10 Women; Median Age  42.5 Years). Extraction Method, Size And Type Of Object, And Postextraction  Evolution Were Reviewed. Results: The Fb Was Introduced Anally In 16 Cases And By  Oral Ingestion In 14. Principal Associated Factors Were: Mental Disorder In 11,  Penitentiary Confinement In Two, And Drug And Alcohol Intake In Two. Recent  Sexual Activity Had Taken Place In 14 Cases. The Size And Nature Of The Fb Were  Varied. The Most Frequent Symptom Was Constipation With Or Without Pelvic Or Anal  Discomfort (N = 23, 77\%). Treatment Consisted Of Spontaneous Ejection (N = 2),  Digital Extraction With Or Without Enemas (N = 10), Digital Extraction Under  Local/Regional Anaesthesia After Fragmentation (N = 11) And Regional Exploratory  Laparotomy Under General Anaesthesia (N = 7). Grade I Rectal Trauma Was The Most  Common (N = 23, 77\%). Six Patients Required Colostomy. Four Patients (13.5\%)  Suffered Complications And None Died. Only 17 Patients Were Hospitalized, With A  Mean Stay Of 6 Days. All Patients Recovered Without Sequelae. Conclusion: The  Diagnosis Of Rectal Fb Should Be Suspected When Faced With Low Pelvic Or Perianal  Abdominal Pain And/Or Rectal Haemorrhage Within The Context Of An Unconvincing  Story In Patients Without A History Of Recent Instrumental Rectal Exploration For  Therapeutic Or Diagnostic Purposes. Because Of Potential Complications, Fb In The  Rectum Should Be Considered A Serious Condition That Must Be Treated Without  Delay.},

Methods: Children {$<$}18Years Old Who  Ingested A Battery Between 1/2011 And 9/2016 At Two Tertiary Care Children'S  Hospitals Were Reviewed. Demographics, Imaging, Management And Outcomes Were  Analyzed Using Descriptive Statistics, Chi-Square And Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Tests.  Results: There Were 180 Battery Ingestions. The Median Age Was 3.9 (Range 0.7-18)  Years, With 78 (43\%) Males. The Most Common Symptoms Were Abdominal Pain (17\%)  And Nausea/Vomiting (14\%). Diagnosis Was Confirmed With Plain Radiographs In 170  (94\%) Patients. Locations On Imaging Were: Stomach (37\%), Small Bowel (24\%),  Esophagus (18\%), Colon (11\%), And Non-Specific Location Past The Gastroesophageal  Junction (9\%). Treatment Was Dictated By Five Different Subspecialties Including  Surgery (35\%), Gastroenterology (25\%), Emergency Medicine (19\%), Primary  Care/Emergency With A Consulting Service (13\%), And Otolaryngology (8\%). All  Esophageal Batteries (N=33) Had An Intervention. Interventions Included  Fluoroscopic Balloon Extraction (6 Attempted, 33\% Retrieval Rate), Rigid  Esophagoscopy (26 Attempted, 96\% Retrieval Rate), And Egd (6 Attempted, 83\%  Retrieval Rate). For Batteries Distal To The Gastroesophageal Junction 16 (11\%)  Patients Had An Intervention. Interventions Included Egd (13 Patients, 69\%  Retrieval), Colonoscopy (1 Patient, Successful Retrieval), And Abdominal Surgery  In Two Patients. Conclusion: Isolated Batteries That Pass The Gastroesophageal  Junction Rarely Require Intervention And Can Be Managed Conservatively. Given The  Variability In Managing These Patients, We Developed An Evidence Based Algorithm.  Level Of Evidence: Level 2. Study Type: Retrospective Study.},

We Performed  Descriptive Statistics To Describe The Study Population. This Was Followed By  Multivariate Analyses To Identify Factors Associated With Mortality. Results: We  Included A Total Of 27,381 Ed Visits For Suffocation Injuries. Most Suffered From  Either Inhalation And Ingestion Of Food Causing Obstruction Of Respiratory Tract  Or Suffocation (51.6\%), Or Suicide And Self-Inflicted Injury By Hanging,  Strangulation, And Suffocation (39.4\%). Overall Mortality Was 10.9\%. Over Half  (54.7\%) Of The Patients Were Between 19 And 65 Years Old. Males Were More Common  Than Females (59.1\% Vs. 40.9\%). Over Half Of The Patients (54.9\%) Were Treated  And Released From The Ed. Factors Associated With Increased Mortality Included  Male Gender, Young Age (4-18 Years), Diseases Of The Cardiac, Respiratory,  Genitourinary And Neurologic Systems, Intentional Self-Harm, And Self-Payer  Status. Conclusion: Mortality From Suffocation Injuries Remains High With  Significant Burden On Children And Adolescents And On Patients With Intentional  Injuries. Tailored Initiatives Targeting Identified Modifiable Factors Through  Implementation Of Behavioral And Environmental Change Can Reduce The Risk Of  Suffocation Injury And Improve Clinical Outcomes Of Affected Victims.},

Methods: The Medical Record Was Queried For All Patients Under 21 Years  Old Evaluated At Our Institution For Button Battery Ingestion From 2008 To 2021.  A Severe Outcome Was Defined As Having At Least One Of The Following:  Deep/Circumferential Mucosal Erosion, Perforation, Mediastinitis, Vascular Or  Airway Injury/Fistula, Or Development Of Esophageal Stricture. From A Selection  Of Clinically Relevant Factors, Logistic Regression Determined Predictors Of A  Severe Outcome, Which Were Incorporated Into A Risk Model. Results: 143 Patients  Evaluated For Button Battery Ingestion Were Analyzed. 24 (17\%) Had A Severe  Outcome. The Independent Predictors Of A Severe Outcome In Multivariate Analysis  Were Location Of Battery In The Esophagus On Imaging (96\%), Battery Size  {$>$}/~=~2~Cm (95\%), And Presence Of Any Symptoms On Presentation (96\%), With  P~{$<~$}0.001 In All Cases. Predicted Probability Of A Severe Outcome Ranged From 88\%  When All Three Risk Factors Were Observed, To 0.3\% When None Were Present.  Conclusion: We Report The Presentation, Management, And Complication Profiles Of  A Large Cohort Of Bb Ingestions Treated At A Single Institution. A Risk Score To  Predict Severe Outcomes May Be Used By Providers Initially Evaluating Patients  With Button Battery Ingestion In Order To Allocate Resources And Expedite  Transfer To A Center With Pediatric Endoscopic And Surgical Capabilities.

Usually The Cases Involve Lumps Of Meat, Bones, Shards  Of Glass, Bottle Tops, Batteries Or Dentures. We Would Like To Report About An  Unusual Foreign Body Found In The Oesophagus. Patient: A 45-Year-Old Patient  Presented Himself In Our Interdisciplinary Casualty Department Where He Claimed  To Have Swallowed A Butter-Knife That Morning As A Bet. The Ent Examination  Showed No Abnormal Findings. The Thorax X-Ray Revealed A 14 Cm-Long Foreign Body  In Projection To The Oesophagus, Which Matched The Knife. Following Consultation  With The Thorax Surgeon, A Rigid Oesophagoscopy Was Conducted Under Endotracheal  Intubation And The Knife Was Easily Removed Using Tongs. Archive Searches  Conducted In The Meantime Showed That Foreign Bodies Had Been Removed From The  Patient On Numerous Occasions By Fellow Surgeons Either Laparoscopically Or Via  Open Surgery. As A Result, The Patient Was Transferred To The Psychiatric Ward  With Unimpeded Swallowing Reflex With A Suspected Self-Harming Syndrome.  Discussion: As An Ent Emergency, A Foreign Body In The Oesophagus Generally  Requires Intervention Because Of The Risk Of Complications Such As Perforation Or  Pressure-Induced Necrosis Of The Oesophagus Wall With Resulting Mediastinitis.  Suitable Instruments Are The Flexible Oesophagoscope, The Rigid Oesophagoscope  Under Anaesthesia Or Transcervical/Transthoracic Removal. The Choice Of Procedure  Crucially Depends On The Type And Localisation Of The Foreign Body In The  Oesophagus. Particularly In Cases Of Unusual Foreign Objects Or Repeated Foreign  Object Ingestion, It Should Be Considered Whether A Psychological Illness Could  Be The Cause And Whether The Introduction Of Appropriate Therapy Could Be  Expedient.},

Methods: We  Reviewed The Clinical History And Radiographic Surveys Of 134 Patients Presenting  With Suspected Or Witnessed Coin Ingestion To The Emergency Department Of A  Tertiary Care Pediatric Hospital Between January 2012 And June 2016. Patient  Demographics, Presenting Symptoms, Anatomic Coverage Of Survey, Type, Number And  Location Of Radiopaque Foreign Bodies, Intervention, And Follow-Up Were Recorded.  Results: Coins Were Identified On Radiographic Surveys In 109 Of 134 Patients; 25  Of 134 Patients Had No Coin. Of Those With Coins, None Of 109 Had Coin(S) In The  Airway, 42 Of 109 Had Coin(S) In The Esophagus, And 67 Of 109 Had Coin(S) Distal  To The Esophagus. Of Those With Esophageal Coins, 35 Of 42 Reported Symptoms, 7  Of 42 Were Asymptomatic, 40 Of 42 Underwent Endoscopic Coin Removal, And 2 Of 42  Had No Intervention. Of 92 Of 134 Surveyed Patients With No Coin Or Coin Distal  To The Esophagus, 30 Of 92 Reported Symptoms, 62 Of 92 Were Asymptomatic, 90 Of  92 Had No Further Intervention, And 2 Of 92 Eventually Underwent Endoscopic Coin  Removal For Specific Indications (Abdominal Pain, Delayed Passage). When There  Was No Coin Found In The Esophagus, The Negative Predictive Value For  Intervention Was 97.8\%.

  abstract = {Introduction And Importance: A Bezoar Is An Indigestible Food Or Other Material Within The Gastrointestinal Tract. It Can Be Ingested Intentionally Or  Accidentally. The Small Bowel Bezoar Prevalence Ranges Between 0.4~\% And 4~\%, And  The Prevalence Is Less Than 0.5~\% For Gastric Bezoars. There Are Different Types  Of Bezoars, But The Mention Of A Plastic Bezoar Rarely Appears In The Literature.  To Our Knowledge, This Is The First Reported Case Of A Plastic Bezoar In The  Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia. Case Presentation: A 58-Year-Old Woman Was Admitted For  Acute Kidney Injury, And While Working Her Up, It Was Discovered That She Had A  Possible Foreign Body On Computerized Tomography Scan. As A Result, She Underwent  Exploratory Laparotomy With The Findings Of Plastic Foreign Objects Identified  90~Cm From The Ileocecal Valve And Other Objects Identified In The Stomach.  Clinical Discussion: The Impaction Of These Materials Often Occurs In Narrow  Areas Such As The Lower Esophagus, Duodenum, Ileocecal Valve Or Even The Anus. In  This Unique Case, Two Points Of Impaction Were Noted: The First Was In The Small  Bowel And The Second Point In The Stomach. The Approach To Such Cases Could Be  Endoscopic Versus Surgical Or Even Chemical Dissolution As A Choice Of Treatment  Is Dependent On Multiple Factors. Conclusion: The Approach To These Cases Is  Multidisciplinary And Depends On The Availability Of Services And Resources At  The Treating Hospital. Reporting Such Cases Helps In Managing Challenging  Situations. Additionally, A Psychiatric Assessment Is A Crucial Step.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Nasal Pharyngolaryngoscopy (Npl) Is Performed As An Outpatient And Inpatient Procedure On A Daily Basis, For A Variety Of Indications. It Frequently Causes Some Degree Of Discomfort To The Patient. Various Different Topical Agents, Which Are Intended To Reduce This Discomfort, Are In Common Use. This Review Aimed To Assess The Effectiveness Of The Various Agents. Objectives To Assess The Effectiveness Of Topical Preparations Used To Reduce Discomfort And Facilitate Npl In Adults. Search Methods We Searched The Cochrane Ear, Nose And Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; The Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials (Central); Pubmed; Embase; Cinahl; Web Of Science; Biosis Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; Isrctn And Additional Sources For Published And Unpublished Trials. The Date Of The Most Recent Search Was 14 April 2010. Selection Criteria Randomised Controlled Trials (Rcts) Looking At The Effect Of Topical Anaesthetic Or Vasoconstrictor Agents Used Reduce Discomfort And Facilitate Npl In Adult Patients. Data Collection And Analysis Two Review Authors Independently Selected Studies, Extracted Data And Assessed Risk Of Bias. We Contacted Trial Authors For Further Information Where Necessary. The Primary Outcome Measured Was Pain/Discomfort. Secondary Outcomes That Were Looked At Included Side Effects Of The Topical Medications, Ease Of The Procedure And The Quality Of The View From The Operator'S Perspective. Main Results We Included Eight Rcts (746 Participants) In The Review. The Risk Of Bias In The Studies Was Generally Low. Five Studies Did Not Demonstrate Any Advantage In Using A Topical Treatment Prior To Endoscopy. One Study Suggested That A Vasoconstrictor Alone Should Be Used To Reduce The General Level Of Unpleasantness. Two Studies Did Not Compare Treatment Against Placebo Or No Treatment, So It Was Not Possible To Draw Meaningful Conclusions From Them. There May Be Some Unpleasant Side Effects From The Use Of Topical Preparations, Such As Unpleasant Taste. There Was Variation In The Format Of The Outcome Data And A Lack Of Complete Data; None Of The Included Studies Reported Their Results In A Way That Would Allow Pooling And We Could Not Therefore Perform Meta-Analysis. Authors' Conclusions The Included Studies Do Not Demonstrate Any Evidence To Support The Use Of Topical Treatments Prior To The Use Of A Fibre-Optic Nasal Endoscope. Some Go As Far As To Suggest That These Agents Should Not Be Used Due To Cost And Unpleasant Side Effects. Five Studies Did Not Demonstrate Any Advantage In Terms Of Reducing Pain Or Discomfort When Using A Topical Treatment Prior To Endoscopy. The Absence Of Demonstrable Effect May Be Due To Relatively Small Patient Groups. It Is Therefore Possible That There Is A Small Effect Of Using These Sprays. Further Research Using Standardised Reporting Methods Is Needed. Plain Language Summary Topical Anaesthetic Or Vasoconstrictor (Blood Vessel Narrowing) Preparations For Flexible Fibre-Optic Nasal Pharyngoscopy And Laryngoscopy Topical Medications Are Often Applied To The Inside Of A Patient'S Nose Prior To Examining The Nose, Sinuses And Throat With A Flexible Nasopharyngolaryngoscope. The Aim Of This Is To Reduce Any Discomfort The Patient May Feel And Also To Improve The Adequacy Of The Examination. Types Of Preparation Include Lidocaine, Phenylephrine And Lidocaine, Oxymetazoline, Xylometazoline And Cocaine And They Are Usually Administered As A Spray, Although They May Also Be In The Form Of A Solution Which Can Be Applied To Cotton Wool And Placed In The Nasal Cavity, Or As Gels, Pastes Or Creams. We Looked For Randomised Controlled Trials Comparing Any Of These Topical Treatments With Placebo, No Treatment Or Another Topical Treatment In Adult Patients Undergoing Nasal Pharyngolaryngoscopy (Npl). We Included Eight Studies In The Review (With A Total Of 746 Patients). It Was Not Possible To Combine Data From Any Of The Studies, Therefore We Assessed The Individual Study Results. Five Of The Studies Did Not Demonstrate Any Advantage, In Terms Of Reducing Pain Or Discomfort, Of Using A Topical Treatment Prior To Endoscopy. One Of These Suggested That A Vasoconstrictor (Xylometazoline) Alone Reduced The Level Of "General Unpleasantness". Two Studies Did Not Compare The Treatment Against Placebo Or No Treatment. A Final Study Actually Suggested An Increase In Pain With The Use Of Topical Agents. There May Be Some Unpleasant Side Effects From The Use Of Topical Preparations, Such As Unpleasant Taste. Further Standardised Research Is Required.},

Here, We Report A Case Of Intentionally Swallowed Coins In The  Oesophagus Of An Adult; The Coins Could Not Be Detected On Chest Radiography But  Were Detected Using Computed Tomography (Ct). Case Presentation: A 46-Year-Old  Woman With A History Of Depression Presented To The Emergency Department After An  Intentional Medication Overdose And Ingestion Of Two Japanese 1-Yen Coins. She  Complained Of Persistent Retrosternal Discomfort. In Order To Confirm Whether The  Coins Were In The Oesophagus Or Trachea, An Anteroposterior Chest Radiograph Was  Obtained; However, No Coins Were Detected. Owing To Her Persistent Symptoms, A  Chest Ct Was Performed. On The Initial Ct Scan, Two 1-Yen Coins Were Observed In  The Oesophagus: One In The Middle Oesophagus And The Other In The Lower  Oesophagus. After The Scanning, The Patient Drank Water With Permission, But  Vomited. No Coins Were Found In Her Vomit, And The Symptoms Of Retrosternal  Discomfort Had Completely Disappeared. A Subsequent Ct Scan Revealed That The Two  1-Yen Coins Were In The Patient'S Stomach. Conclusions: Japanese 1-Yen Coins Are  Made Of 100\% Aluminium, Which Is Less Radiopaque Than The Metals That Make Up  Coins (Nickel, Bronze, And Lead), And So, They Were Not Visible Via Chest  Radiography In Our Case. Detecting Very Small Or Thin Radiolucent Foreign Bodies  Is Not Possible Using A Chest Radiograph Or Contrast Oesophagram, But Is Possible  Via Ct. Ct Is Both Increasingly Convenient And Non-Invasive, Unlike Endoscopy Or  Bronchoscopy, And So, The Use Of Ct Scans Should Be Considered In Cases Of  Possible Radiolucent Foreign Body Ingestion.},

In Adults, Foreign Body Ingestion Is More Common In  Patients With Underlying Psychiatric Comorbidity, The Elderly, Alcohol  Intoxication, And In Prisoners. This Study Reviewed The Management Of Patients  Presenting To A Tertiary Hospital With Foreign Body Ingestion. Patients And  Methods A Retrospective Review Of Patients Presenting With Foreign Body Ingestion  To A Tertiary Hospital In Melbourne, Victoria, Was Undertaken From January 2017  To December 2021. Data Collected Included Patient Demographics, Type Of Foreign  Body, Length Of Stay, Imaging Modalities, Management Strategies, And  Complications. High-Risk Ingestion Was Defined As Sharp Objects, Length {$>$}5 Cm,  Diameter {$>$}2.5 Cm, Button Battery And/Or Magnet Ingestion Or Esophageal As Per  International Guidelines. Results A Total Of 157 Presentations By 63 Patients  With Foreign Body Ingestion Occurred Between 2017 And 2021 (50\% Male; Median Age  30 Years). Of The Patients, 56\% Had Underlying Psychiatric Comorbidities. The  Majority Of Presentations Occurred In Prisoners (65\%). The Most Commonly Ingested  Objects Were Batteries (23\%), Alleged Drug-Containing Balloons (17\%), Razor  Blades (16\%), And Miscellaneous (40\%). High-Risk Ingestion Occurred In  Approximately Two-Thirds Of Presentations. Conservative Management Was The Most  Common Approach In 55\% Of Patients. Complications, Defined As Perforation, Bowel  Obstruction Or Fistula Formation, Did Not Occur In This Cohort Despite More Than  Half Presenting With High-Risk Ingestions. Thirty-Day Re-Presentation Rates Were  High (31\%) And That Was Most Common In Patients With Intentional Ingestion,  Underlying Mental Health Disorders, And A Documented History Of Self-Harm.  Conclusions Conservative Management For Patients Presenting With Recurrent  High-Risk Foreign Body Ingestion Was Safe In Appropriately Selected Cases.  Re-Presentation Is Common And Poses Significant Challenges For Health Care  Providers.},

This Study Aimed To Analyse The Circumstances Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts In A Japanese Psychiatric Hospital So As To Improve Management And Care. Methods: Incident Reports Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts During A 12.4-Year Period From November 2000 To March 2013 Were Reviewed. A Descriptive Analysis Was Conducted In Terms Of Age, Sex, And Diagnosis Of Patients, As Well As Level, Ward, Situations, And Causes Of Incidents. Results: During The Study Period, 90 Cases Of Self-Harm And Attempted Suicide Involving 58 Patients Were Reported. The Rate Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts Was 0.05 Per 1000 Patient-Days. The Types Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts Included Hanging (N = 25), Wrist Cutting (N = 19), Ingestion Of Foreign Objects (N = 17), And Others (N = 29). The Single Case Of Completed Suicide Involved Hanging, In A Patient With Schizophrenia. Among 55 Patients With Relevant Data, The Most Common Clinical Diagnosis Was Mood Disorder (41.8\%), Followed By Schizophrenia (36.4\%). Mood Disorder Was 3.5 Times As Prevalent In Females As In Males (14 Vs. 4). Fourteen Patients With Mood Disorder (N = 8) Or Schizophrenia (N = 6) Were Repeatedly Involved In 46 Of 89 Cases Of Self-Harm Or Attempted Suicide; 11 Were Female. One Woman With Mood Disorder Attempted Suicide 9 Times Within The Same Year. The Top 3 Management And Care Factors Related To Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts Were Failure To Adhere To Preventive Procedures (28\%), Insufficient Therapeutic Communication (28\%), And Difficulty In Predicting Suicide (20\%). Conclusion: Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts At This Psychiatric Hospital Occurred At A Rate Of 0.05 Per 1000 Patient-Days Between Late 2000 And Early 2013. Efforts Are Needed To Increase Compliance With Suicide Prevention Procedures And Therapeutic Communication, So As To Improve Management And Care Of Psychiatric In-Patients And Prevent Them From Committing Suicide. {\copyright} 2018 Hong Kong College Of Psychiatrists.},

Therefore, This  Study Compares The Advantages And Disadvantages Of Both Endoscopic Procedures  From A Clinical Perspective. Methods: A Retrospective Review Was Made Of 273  Patients Suspected Of Esophageal Fbs In Emergency Consultations Of A Tertiary  Medical Referral Center From March 2010 To March 2014. All Patients Received  Routine Physical Examinations, Otolaryngological Examinations, And X-Rays Of The  Neck And Chest. The Door-To-Endoscopy Time, Procedure Time, Postendoscopic  Hospital Stay, Successful Removal Rates, And Complications Were Analyzed As Well.  Results: In This Study, The Most Common Esophageal Fbs Were Fish And Animal Bones  (76\%) In Adults And Coins (74\%) In Children. The Patients With Existing  Esophageal Fbs Had Significantly More Frequent Symptoms Of Dysphagia And Signs Of  Linear Opacity As Detected With Lateral Neck Radiography Than Those Without Fb.  Additionally, The Door-To-Endoscopy Time, Procedure Time, And Postendoscopic  Hospital Stay Was Significantly Shorter In Fe Patients Than In Re Patients.  However, Both Re And Fe Patients Had High Rates Of Successful Fb Removal (95\%)  And Low Complication Rates (2\%). Conclusion: Both Fe And Re Remove Esophageal Fbs  Successfully, As Evidenced By Their High Success Rates, Low Complication Rates,  And High Detection Rates. Although Fe Under Local Anesthesia Is A Less  Time-Consuming Procedure For Adults, Re Under General Anesthesia May Be  Preferable For Children And Can Serve As An Alternative To Fe.},

Methods: Medical Records Of 74  Pediatric Patients From 9 Large Chinese Hospitals During The Past 10\,Years, Who  Were Diagnosed As Buckyball Magnets Ingestion And Got Invasive Treatment, Were  Retrospectively Studied. The Follow-Up Was Through Telephone And Outpatient  Service To Estimate The Post-Surgery Condition. Information Collection Was  Through Online Questionnaire. Results: Among The 74 Cases, There Were 50 Boys  (68\%) And 24 Girls (32\%). The Median Age Was 36 (Interquartile Range (Iqr) 22-77)  Months, With A Range Of 7\,Months To 11\,Years, And It Showed Two Peaks, The First  Between 1 And 3\,Years, And The Second Between 6 To 11\,Years. The Annual Case  Number Showed A Sharp Increase Over Time, And The Total Case Number In The Last  2\,Years (2017 And 2018) Showed A Greater Than 9-Fold Increase When Compared With  The First 2\,Years (2013 And 2014). The Majority Of Ingestions Were Unintentional,  With Only 3 Patients Deliberately Swallowing The Buckyball Magnets. The Median  Time Of Ingestion Until The Onset Of Emergent Symptoms Was 2 (Iqr 1-5) Days, And  Ranged From 4\,H To 40\,Days. Twenty-One Patients Had No Symptoms, And The  Remaining Cases Presented With Abdominal Pain, Vomiting, Fever, Abdominal  Distension, Excessive Crying, Melena, And The Ceasing Of Flatus And Defecation.  Gastroscopy, Colonoscopy, Laparoscopic Surgery And Laparotomy Surgery Were  Performed In Accordance With The Algorithm From The North American Society Of  Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology And Nutrition (Naspghan). Procedural And  Operative Findings Included Gastrointestinal Mucosa Erosion, Ischemia And  Necrosis, Perforation, And Abdominal Abscess, Fistula And Intestinal Obstruction.  The Median Number Of Buckyball Magnets Ingested Was 4 (Iqr 2-8), With A Range  From 1 To 39. During The Median Follow-Up Period Of 6 (Iqr 1-15) Months, 3  Patients Had Intestinal Obstruction, And One Underwent A Second Operation. The  Remaining 71 Patients Courses Were Uneventful During The Follow-Up Period. None  Of The 74 Patients Reported A Second Swallowing Of Foreign Bodies. Conclusions:  The Incidence Of Pediatric Gastrointestinal Tract Magnets Ingestion In China Is  Increasing. Management Of Such Patients Should Follow The Naspghan Algorithm.  Preventive Measures To Limit Children'S Access To Buckyball Magnets Should Be  Taken From Three Levels, Namely The National Administration, Producer, And  Consumer.},

Purpose: To Evaluate The  Potential Value Of Computed Tomography (Ct) In Guiding The Selection Of Surgical  Treatment For Patients With Ingested Foreign Bodies In The Lower Gastrointestinal  Tract. Methods: Between January 2014 And December 2023, We Analyzed The Data Of  58 Patients (Median Age: 65.4~Years; Range, 31-96~Years) With Ingested Foreign  Bodies In The Lower Gastrointestinal Tract Who Underwent Ct Examinations.  Patients Were Treated Either Conservatively (35 Cases) Or Surgically (23 Cases).  The Angle Between The Long Axis Of The Foreign Body And The Intestinal Canal  (Fb-Ic Angle) Was Measured. Ct Findings And Clinical Variables Were Evaluated To  Identify Potential Indicators For Surgical Treatment Through Univariate And  Multivariate Logistic Regression Analyses. Results: Univariate Analysis Revealed  The Fb-Ic Angle (P\,=\,0.002), Presence Of Free Peritoneal Gas (P\,=\,0.002), White  Blood Cell Count (P\,=\,0.018), And Neutrophil Count (P\,=\,0.007) As Significant  Factors Associated With Surgical Treatment. Multivariate Analysis Demonstrated  That The Fb-Ic Angle (Odds Ratio, 1.033; P\,=\,0.045) And The Presence Of Free  Peritoneal Gas (Odds Ratio, 41.335; P\,=\,0.002) Are Independent Indicators For  Surgical Management. The Fb-Ic Angle Showed An Area Under The Receiver Operating  Characteristic Curve Of 0.755, With A Cutoff Value Of 51.25 Degrees. Conclusion:  The Fb-Ic Angle And Presence Of Free Peritoneal Gas Serve As Potential Predictive  Imaging Markers For Surgical Intervention.},

The Preoperative Examination Using Ultrasonography And Computed Tomography Showed A Linear Foreign Body. Results: The Fish Bone Was Thought To Be Embedded Deeply In The Parotid Duct; Therefore, We Used A Combined Approach (Endoscopy With Open Surgery), Because We Anticipated Difficulties With Endoscopic Removal Of The Fish Bone. The Endoscopic View Showed That The Fish Bone Had Partially Penetrated The Soft Tissue In The Parotid Duct Wall, But The Fish Bone Could Not Be Removed Endoscopically. With Endoscopic Assistance, The Impacted Fish Bone Was Removed Using An Intraoral Surgical Approach. The Clinical Outcome Was Satisfactory During A 10-Month Follow-Up Period, With No Evidence Of Complications.

Methods: Inedible Substance Ingestion Incidents Were Extracted From An Incident Report Database Spanning 2000--2012 At A 400-Bed Psychiatric Hospital In Japan. We Tabulated The Frequencies Of Incidents In Accordance With Major Diagnosis, Ingested Materials, Incident Levels, And Time Of Occurrence. Results: The Incidence Rate Was 0.09/1000 Patient Days, And 149 Cases In 105 Patients Were Classified As Having Experienced Inedible Substance Ingestion. The Most Common Diagnosis Was Dementia (N = 58), Followed By Schizophrenia (N = 22). Materials Ingested By Dementia Patients Were Nappies Or Gauze Attached To The Patient'S Body After Medical Procedures. Materials Ingested By Schizophrenic Patients Were Liquid Soap, Detergent Or Shampoo, And Cigarettes. Inedible Substance Ingestion Among Dementia Patients Occurred Mostly Before Or During Meals. Among Schizophrenic Patients, The Peak Period Of Incidents Was In The Evening. Conclusions: Dementia Patients Were Overrepresented In The Inedible Substance Ingestion Incidents. Items They Wore Or Applied To Their Bodies Were Often Subject To Ingestion, And Such Behaviours Mostly Occurred Around Meal Time. Therefore, The Nursing Staff Were Able To Discover Them Quickly And Treat Most Of The Cases Free Of Serious Consequences. In Contrast, Schizophrenic Patients Were Underrepresented In The Incidents, And Most Cases Involved Ingestion Of Detergent Powder Or Cigarettes, Resulting In More Serious Consequences And Requiring Treatment.

A 29-Year-Old Mentally Retarded Female Patient Was Admitted To The Emergency Service With A Two-Day History Of Abdominal Pain, Nausea, And Vomiting. Physical Examination Revealed Abdominal Tenderness, Defense, And Rebound On Palpation. Radiological Examination Revealed Diffuse Air-Fluid Levels And A Radiopaque Impression Of A Metal Object In The Right Upper Quadrant. The Metal Teaspoon Causing Ileal Perforation Was Extracted By Emergency Laparotomy. On Postoperative Day 7, The Patient Was Uneventfully Discharged Following A Psychiatric Consultation. Discussion. Foreign Body Ingestion Can Occur Intentionally In Children At Developing Ages And Old-Age Patients, Or Adults And Prisoners, Whereas It May Occur Unintentionally In Patients With Mental Retardation Due To Hallucination. However, Repeated Foreign Body Ingestion Is Very Rare In Individuals Other Than Mentally Retarded Patients. Conclusion. Mentally Retarded Patients Should Be Kept Under Close Surveillance By Surgeons And Psychiatrists Due To Their Tendency To Ingest Foreign Bodies.},

However, Complication Was Significantly Associated With Nonfood Bolus Fb Ingestion On Holidays (P{$<$}.001). Our Data Suggest That There Were Different Clinicopathological Characteristics Of Fb Ingestion Between Weekdays And Holidays, And More Patients Got Complications On Holidays. On Holidays, A Latex Protector Hood Or An Overtube Should Be Applied To Patients Who Swallowed Nonfood Bolus In Order To Reduce Esophageal Mucosal Damage.},

  abstract = {Background: There Is Paucity Of Data Regarding The Prevalence And Methods Of Deliberate Self-Harm (Dsh) In Patients With Heroin Dependence In International Literature. In China, There Have Been A Few Studies Investigating The Prevalence Of Dsh In Heroin-Dependent Patients (Hdps), But Their Rates Varied Widely. We Thus Conducted A Meta-Analysis Of Studies Assessing The Prevalence Of Dsh Among Chinese Hdps. Methods: Relevant Studies Were Retrieved From Major Chinese Databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, And Sinomed) And Western Databases (Pubmed, Embase, And Psycinfo). Two Authors Independently Identified Eligible Studies And Extracted Data. Studies That Included A Representative Sample Of Chinese Hdps And Ascertained Dsh Caseness In A Reliable Way Were Considered As High Quality. Statistical Analysis Was Performed Using R Software. Results: In Total, 15 Eligible Studies With A Total Of 37,243 Chinese Hdps Were Included. All Included Studies Were Conducted In Heroin Detoxification Settings. Only Two Studies Were Rated As High Quality. The Pooled Prevalence Of Dsh In Chinese Hdps Was 4.4\% (95\%Ci: 2.9, 6.2\%), But The Heterogeneity Of Prevalence Rates Across Studies Was Significant (I2 = 98\%, P {$<$} 0.001). Studies Rated As High Quality Had Significantly Higher Prevalence Of Dsh Than Those Rated As Low Quality (13.2 Vs. 3.4\%, P {$<$} 0.001). Swallowing Foreign Objects Was The Most Common Method Of Dsh, With A Combined Prevalence Of 2.7\% (95\%Ci: 1.6, 4.4\%). Extreme Dsh Methods Such As Cutting Offfingers And Jumping From Height Were Also Not Uncommon In This Patient Population. Conclusion: Due To Methodological Problems In Available Studies, We Find A Relatively Low Prevalence Of Dsh Among Chinese Hdps Receiving Detoxification Treatment. Nevertheless, The Self-Harmers Of Chinese Hdps Are More Likely To Harm Themselves In A Dangerous Or Life-Threatening Way. Restricting The Availability Of Dsh Methods May Be An Effective Way To Prevent Or Reduce Dsh In China'S Detoxification Treatment Settings. {\copyright} 2018 Zhong, Xu, Xie, Chen And Lu.},

  abstract = {Backgrounds: Previous Reports Of Foreign-Body Ingestion Focused Primarily On Accidental Ingestion And Very Few Studies Focused On Intentional Ingestion Of  Foreign Body (Fb) In China. Our Study Aimed To Compare The Prevalence Of  Different Age, Gender, Types, Locations And Management Of Fb Ingested Between  Intentional Ingestion And Accidental Ingestion Of Fb In Northern China. Methods:  A Retrospective Case Series Studied All Patients With Suspected Fb Ingestion In  Digestive Endoscopy Center Of Beijing Friendship Hospital, Between January 2011  And January 2019. The Patients Were Divided Into 2 Groups. Group A Included The  Patients Who Intentionally Ingested Fbs, And Group B Included The Patients Who  Accidentally Ingested Fbs. Patients' Database (Demographics, Past Medical  History, Characteristics Of Fb, Endoscopic Findings And Treatments) Were  Reviewed. Statistical Analyses Were Conducted Using Spss Software. Results: Group  A Consisted Of 77 Prisoners, 2 Suspects And 11 Psychologically Disabled Persons.  Group B Consisted Of 1020 Patients With No Prisoners, Suspects Or Psychologically  Disabled Persons. In Group A, There Were No Food-Related Foreign Bodies, And The  Majority Of Fbs Were Metallic Objects (54.44\%). However In Group B, Food-Related  Fbs Were The Most Common (91.37\%). In Group A, 58 Cases (64.44\%) Were Located In  The Stomach, While In Group B, 893 Cases (87.55\%) Were Located In The Esophagus  (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). 1096 Patients Successfully Underwent Endoscopic Removal And 14  Failed, Including 9 Cases In Group A And 5 Cases In Group B. The Duration Of Fbs  Impaction Was Longer In Group A Than That In Group B (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Conclusions: In  Our Study, The Patients Who Intentionally Ingested Fb Were Mainly Prisoners, Fbs  Were Mostly Sharp Metallic Objects, The Duration Of Fbs Impaction Was Longer, And  The Rate Of Successful Endoscopic Treatment Was Lower Than That Of The General  Population. Attention Should Be Focused On These Patients.},
