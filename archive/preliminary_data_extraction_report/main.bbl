      \field{abstract}{The Institute of Race Relations has over the last twenty-three years been monitoring the 508 deaths in custody in suspicious circumstances of individuals from BME, migrant and refugee communities, which rarely make the headlines and for which no person is ever convicted (to be published as the report Dying for Justice). Here, in an extract, the author examines the culture of racism and the impact of privatisation and sub-contracting in the detention and deportation of `failed' asylum seekers. In case after case it exposes how the vulnerable, mentally- and physically-ill are neglected -- leading to deaths by self-harm and inadequate treatment. The death during deportation of Joy Gardner, which involved disproportionate and reckless use of force, is examined in depth. The use of equipment of control for those who are clearly fearful of being forcibly returned, remains a vexed issue.}

      \field{abstract}{Background Despite the exposure to a wide combination of risk factors, evidence concerning risk of suicide among refugees is mixed. Aims We aimed to establish more precise estimates of suicide and suicidal behavior in refugees and asylum seekers, investigate the role of somatic and psychiatric comorbidities, and the effectiveness of preventative interventions. Methods We searched PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycInfo without time limitations from inception until June 5, 2024. Studies were included if systematic reviews or meta-analyses reporting data on suicide or suicidal behavior in refugees or asylum seekers, or detailing the results of preventive interventions. Quality was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Results Out of 49 papers, 10 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included. Refugees showed significantly higher suicide death rates and suicidal ideation, suicide plan and suicide attempt prevalence compared to people living in the host countries. Refugees who arrived in low-income and lower-middle-income countries displayed lower suicidal ideation, but higher suicide death rates and suicide attempt prevalence compared to refugees who arrived in high-income and upper-middle-income countries. However, no review provided data regarding somatic comorbidity, psychiatric comorbidity, or the effectiveness of treatments, and evidence on specific categories of refugees is scarce. Conclusion Refugees have been proven to be at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. More research is required to identify the targets and procedures of intervention.}

      \field{abstract}{Background: Even though asylum seekers are considered vulnerable to mental ill-health, knowledge of their suicidal behaviour is limited. The aim of this study was to improve our understanding of factors that influence the clinical assessment of asylum seekers who have attempted suicide compared to the assessment of non-asylum seekers. Methods: The study focused on 88 asylum seekers registered for suicide attempts in mental health services 2005--2009, who were matched for age and gender and compared with 88 suicide attempters with Swedish personal identity numbers. The medical records were analysed with a quantitative protocol, focusing on social risk and protective factors, health history, current clinical picture as well as the assessment procedure, diagnostics, patterns of treatment and follow-up in this clinical group. Data was analysed using the chi-square test, Fisher's exact probability test, and the Mann--Whitney U test. Results: As in earlier studies, asylum seekers were more traumatized, had different social risk factors and received different diagnoses than the controls. Asylum seekers were referred to less specialized follow-up after treatment, in spite of their health history and of previous and current clinical pictures indicating a similar or - in the case of the female asylum seekers - more serious mental health condition. Female asylum seekers also received more intense and prolonged in-patient treatment than female controls. Asylum seekers appeared to have social networks more often than the control group. However, there was less documentation of the social context, previous suicidal behaviour, and on suicide in the family and close environment of the asylum-seeking men. Information on suicidal intent was lacking in a majority of both groups. The time relation of the suicide attempt and the asylum process suggested the importance of the asylum decision, as well as the possible role of earlier mental health problems and premigration stress, for the suicidal behaviour. Conclusions: The groups had different sets of risk factors and clinical pictures. There was a lack of early and thorough exploration of suicide intent for both groups, and of contextual and subjective factors for the asylum seekers. Differences in follow-up indicate unequal access to care.}

      \field{abstract}{The number of asylum seekers, refugees and internally displaced people worldwide has increased dramatically over the past 5 years. Many countries are continuing to resort to detaining asylum seekers and other migrants, despite concerns that this may be harmful. In light of the considerable body of recent research, this review aims to update and expand on a 2009 systematic review on the mental health consequences of detention on adult, adolescent and child immigration detainees, which found (on the basis on 9 studies) that there was consistent evidence that immigration detention had adverse effects on mental health.}

      \field{abstract}{Background: Systematic research into self-harm in the Australian asylum seeker population is scarce, largely due to the lack of accessible data. The aim of this study was to examine the incidence and characteristics of self-harm across the Australian asylum seeker population, and to ascertain whether self-harm rates and characteristics vary by processing arrangements (i.e. community-based arrangements, community detention, onshore detention, offshore detention (Nauru), and offshore detention (Manus Island)), and gender. Methods: Data relating to the incidence of self-harm, method(s) used to self-harm, processing arrangements, and gender were extracted from all self-harm incidents recorded as occurring among the Australian asylum seeker population between 1st August 2014 and 31st July 2015. Self-harm episode rates were calculated using the average estimated adult population figures for the 12-month period for each asylum seeker population. Results: 949 self-harm episodes were included in the analyses. Rates ranged from 5 per 1000 asylum seekers in community-based arrangements to 260 per 1000 asylum seekers in offshore detention in Nauru. Rates were highest among asylum seekers in offshore and onshore detention facilities, and lowest among asylum seekers in community-based arrangements and community detention. The most common methods of self-harm were cutting (37\%), self-battery (26\%), and attempted hanging (11\%), with asylum seekers in held detention using a wider variety of methods than those in community-based arrangements and community detention. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the exceptionally high rates of self-harm among detained asylum seekers compared to rates observed in the general Australian population, and among asylum seekers in communitybased settings. These findings point clearly to the deleterious impact of immigration detention, and warrant urgent attention.}

      \field{abstract}{The UK has proposed numerous controversial migration enforcement policies aimed at deterring asylum seekers and stopping unauthorised Channel crossings, including mandatory detention and deportation schemes that would send people to ``safe third countries'' like Rwanda. Tens of thousands of people are detained every year in the country's privatised ``immigration removal centres,'' where they can remain indefinitely as the UK has not adopted limits on the length of migration-related detention.}

      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND: Previous reports of foreign-body ingestions focused primarily on accidental ingestions. OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics and management of foreign-body ingestions, with predominantly intentional ingestion, in a lower socioeconomic status population. DESIGN: A retrospective case series. SETTING: An urban county hospital. PATIENTS: Patients {$>$}/=17 years old, with foreign-body ingestions between 2000 and 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Characteristics of ingestion cases, endoscopic extraction, need for surgery, and complications. RESULTS: Among 262 cases, 92\% were intentional, 85\% involved psychiatric patients, and 84\% occurred in patients with prior ingestions. The time from ingestion to presentation was {$>$}48 hours in 168 cases (64\%). The overall success rate for endoscopic extraction was 90\% (165/183 cases). Surgery was performed in 30 cases (11\%) and was more common for objects beyond the pylorus versus objects above the pylorus (16/43 [37\%] vs 10/151 [7\%], respectively) and in cases with a greater delay from ingestion to presentation (25/168 [15\%] if {$>$}48 hours vs 4/77 [5\%] if {$<$}/=48 hours) and from presentation to intervention (15/40 [38\%] if {$>$}48 hours vs 14/165 [8\%] if}

      \field{abstract}{Thoughout the world the number of refugees and asylum seekers continues to increase at an astonishing rate. Given that most will have left their country due to persecution, war, or appalling violations of their human rights, many will have specific mental health needs. Cultural and socioeconomic factors play a major role in expressions of distress, help seeking, pathways into care, and acceptance or rejection of treatments. Being a refugee or asylum seeker raises questions about an individual's self respect and altered identity. Too often though, the needs of this population are ignored by policy makers and clinicians, and these people are left to fend for themselves. Mental Health of Refugees and Asylum Seekers presents both the theoretical and practical aspects of the mental health needs of refugees and asylum seekers. It looks at the impact of migration on mental health and adjustment, collective trauma, individual identity, and diagnostic fallacies. A practical section highlights cultural factors, ethnopsychopharmacology, therapeutic interaction, therapeutic expectation and psychotherapy. The final part of the book focuses on special problems - such as bereavement, sexual violence, and post traumatic stress disorders, as well as considering mental health problems in special groups, such as child refugees. This book will be an essential resource for all mental health professionals- helping them better understand the needs of refugees and asylum seekers, how their problems can be managed, and how they can best be helped.}

      \field{abstract}{Introduction{\enspace} Asylum seekers and refugees are at an elevated risk of self-\-harm, with younger age and traumatic experiences found to further increase such risk. Despite this, evidence regarding self-h\- arm among unaccompanied asylum seekers and refugee minors has not been synthesised. As self-\-harm among minors is a risk factor for a range of adverse clinical and social outcomes, including suicide, such information may help to inform evidence-\- based prevention strategies among these vulnerable populations. This systematic review will synthesise findings from the literature regarding the prevalence, methods and characteristics of self-h\- arm, including risk and protective factors, among unaccompanied asylum seekers and refugee minors internationally. Methods and analysis{\enspace} We searched key electronic databases (PsycINFO, Scopus, PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE) and grey literature for relevant studies published in English from database inception to 10 February 2023. Our primary outcome is self-h\- arm among unaccompanied asylum seekers and/or refugee minors. With the exception of single-c\- ase studies, clinical trials and case-\-control studies, we will include all types of study design that examine the prevalence of self-h\- arm in unaccompanied asylum seekers and/or refugee minors. We will exclude dissertations, conference abstracts, letters, book chapters, editorials, study registrations, registered protocols and qualitative studies. Only studies reporting on participants aged {$<$}18 years will be eligible for inclusion. The Methodological Standard for Epidemiological Research Scale will be used to assess the quality of included studies. If there are sufficient studies and homogeneity between them, we will conduct meta-a\- nalyses to calculate pooled estimates of self-h\- arm rates, as well as comparisons between subgroups of relevance. If the studies do not report sufficient data, or there is substantial heterogeneity, we will provide a narrative synthesis of the findings. Ethics and dissemination{\enspace} This review is exempt from ethics approval. Our findings will be disseminated through peer-r\-eviewed publications and conference presentations.

      \field{abstract}{This work reflects on the character of the modalities that non-status migrants are deploying in the context of current politics of the camp, with special attention to the Italian context. It will suggest that once the possibilities of dissent through the voice (the political tool par excellence in a liberal democracy, and one associated primarily with rationality and the capacity for reason) are foreclosed, migrants tend to resort to another powerful tool: their own body. Detainees have made their bodies speak by resorting to practices of self-mutilation, hunger strike, suicide attempts, and lips and eyes sewing. Detainees' violent acts of dissent are not dissimilar from the violent modalities used, a few centuries earlier, by some enslaved people who chose liberty through death. The aim is not so much to make comparison between the two figures, but to emphasise the way in which, under conditions of extreme control, subjugation or unfreedom, acts of dissent and resistance -- and thus acts of politics, as articulated in Rancière's concept of dissensus -- are not necessarily enacted through democratic practices but, on the contrary, through whatever modalities are available to them, including violent (self-harm) modalities.}

      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND: We present our experience with an as yet undescribed type of intentionally ingested metallic foreign body that was specially designed to arrest in its passage and cause perforation of the gastrointestinal tract. The two halves of a standard paper clip are tied crosswise with a rubber band, forming an elastic "cross." With its branches squeezed to lie parallel, the cross is wrapped into a small strip of paper and ingested. After being released from its wrapper, the branches of the cross spring back to their original position and cause perforation of the bowel wall. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: University hospital, Bulgaria. PATIENTS: Five male prisoners from the same jail undergoing laparotomy for foreign body removal during 1 week in January 1994. INTERVENTIONS: Laparotomy, removal of the foreign bodies through incisions of the bowel wall, immediate restoration of the gastrointestinal tract continuity, and peritoneal lavage and drainage. OUTCOME MEASURES: Morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Two of the patients were initially observed but subsequently underwent surgery for perforations of the gastrointestinal tract. Three of the patients underwent immediate operative treatment. There were 20 total crosses ingested; all foreign objects impacted and perforated the stomach (50\%), first duodenal portion (25\%), and fourth duodenal portion (20\%). There was no morbidity or mortality among the five patients treated. CONCLUSIONS: Because ingested crosses that have been released from their wrappers never move distally, the only definitive solution is to operate early.}

      \field{abstract}{Deliberate and recurrent foreign body ingestion is a common problem among institutionalised patients. We review our experience with 36 cases of deliberate foreign body ingestion by prisoners or psychiatric patients, thirty of whom were institutionalised at the time of ingestion. Symptoms were frequently severe in the prison inmate group but, in contrast, psychiatric patients presented with few, if any, symptoms. A majority of objects pass spontaneously or remain in situ without complication. Twenty-four patients were discharged following initial evaluation and without specific treatment. Eight of these were reviewed electively and discharged within one week. Twelve patients were admitted for observation, seven of whom were discharged within 48 hrs. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed in four patients and an intragastric foreign body identified in two cases. Laparotomy was performed in two cases for unresolving mechanical intestinal obstruction. Management should be conservative when possible, with surgery indicated only for complications.}

      \field{abstract}{The topic of foreign body ingestion has received extensive coverage in the areas of surgery, emergency medicine, and pediatrics. A subset of this topic, the intentional ingestion of foreign bodies, however, is much less common, and requires special evaluation and management. Here, we report a case of ingestion of a rolled, metal tuna can lid in a male prison inmate previously diagnosed with depression and paranoid schizophrenia. Following evaluation by the surgical team, the foreign body was removed by laparotomy and the patient was discharged back to the prison without complication. In many cases, ingestions of this type involve a command hallucination ordering the patient to swallow the foreign body. Interestingly, the patient in the present case reported auditory hallucinations commanding him not to swallow the can lid. On further investigation, we found that patient had a proclivity toward this swallowing behavior even prior to his incarceration. Early identification of inmates with this proclivity has important implications for treatment and prevention.}

      \field{abstract}{Objective: Ingestion of sharp foreign bodies is a less frequently encountered method of self-harm. This study aims to follow up patients presenting with foreign body (FB) ingestion requiring urgent endoscopic intervention under general anaesthetic in theatre, characterise each patient and establish whether admission or removal of the FB promotes further self-harm. Method: Eleven adult patients, totalling 38 presentations over a 28-month period were identified. Each was followed up from an initial presentation requiring endoscopy. Result: 9/11 (81.9\%) where transferred either from prison or psychiatric care with an extensive history of multimodal and usually violent self-harm. Of these 8/9 (88.9\%) had a formal psychiatric diagnosis linked to their previous self-harm. Objects retrieved included pens, razor blades, cutlery, wiring, batteries, a metal screw and a TV aerial. The median time between presentations with self-harm was 11 days. Those discharged from the emergency department re-presented after a median of 7.5 days. This was longer, at 14 days, if admitted to hospital; with those having endoscopic procedures re-presenting after a median of 11 days. Conclusions: Inpatient endoscopic removal of the FB was not associated with an earlier presentation with further self-harm when compared with discharge straight form A+E, but was frequently repeated, often in a characterised manner.

      \field{abstract}{Deliberate foreign body ingestion is a significant issue in prison and psychiatric settings. It is associated with serious physical complications, including bowel obstruction, perforation and haemorrhage. Episodes of deliberate foreign body ingestion were identified retrospectively from 5417 incident records from two inpatient forensic services (one mental health and one intellectual disability) over a one year timeframe, using related search terms. Rates were compared according to gender, diagnosis and level of security. Incidents of deliberate foreign body ingestion were found to occur on average every 2.7 days across the study population, with 133 incidents recorded over a one year period, accounted for by 27 patients. Women and patients in lower levels of security were significantly more likely to engage in deliberate foreign body ingestion. Staff responses to this behaviour were highly variable. Deliberate foreign body ingestion occurs frequently within inpatient forensic services, and can have significantly detrimental physical implications for affected patients. Further research should investigate the psychiatric and intellectual disability profile of such individuals in further detail, as well as exploring patient narratives; both of which will help inform development of treatment strategies.

      \field{abstract}{INTRODUCTION: The swallowing of foreign bodies can be accidental or intentional. The majority of the cases of accidental foreign body ingestion are observed in children. In adults, foreign body ingestion can be accidental, related to specific pathological changes of the digestive tract, or deliberate, as observed in patients with psychiatric diseases or in those released from the prison. CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with symptoms including choking, drooling from the mouth, holding his neck, and aphonia. He had a history of psychiatric illness with suicidal ingestion of a foreign body. After stabilization, he was sent for chest radiograph, which revealed a significant radiopaque shadow the shape of a spanner, occupying the whole length of the esophagus. Emergency rigid esophagoscopy was performed to save the patient's life. DISCUSSION: The patient swallowed the largest hard foreign body to harm himself or his family, to get the attention of his family, or as a suicide attempt. Such patients require urgent intervention by rigid esophagoscopy to reduce the risk of complications and to save the patients' lives. Further follow-up is essential due to the possibility of repeated foreign body ingestion. CONCLUSION: While taking care of psychiatric patients, close observation by family members is mandatory to prevent them from harming themselves and to prevent suicide attempts by swallowing sharp, hard, large, and dangerous foreign bodies such as the size 17 wrench spanner observed in the present case.}

      \field{abstract}{Purpose: Few case studies in the literature report on adult patients with intentional foreign body ingestion. Prisoners deliberately ingest foreign bodies, such as cylindrical alkaline batteries and razor blades, to achieve hospitalization or commit suicide. The purpose of this paper is to present a case of deliberate ingestion of batteries and razor blades by an inmate. Design/methodology/approach: The authors present a case of an incarcerated man in Greece, who intentionally ingested three cylindrical alkaline batteries and three razor blades wrapped in aluminum foil. Findings: The patient was treated conservatively with serial radiographs and was subsequently discharged without complication. This paper discusses the complications and examine the current guidelines available. Originality/value: To best of authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a simultaneous ingestion of batteries and razor blades. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)}

      \field{abstract}{Self-\-harm within immigration detention centres has been a widely documented phenomenon, occurring at far higher rates than the wider community. Evidence suggests that factors such as the conditions of detention and uncertainty about refugee status are among the most prominent precipitators of self-\-harm. While important in explaining self-h\- arm, this is not the entire story. In this paper, we argue for a more overtly political interpretation of detainee self-\-harm as resistance and assess the ethical implications of this view, drawing on interviews with detainees from Australia's offshore system. Self-\-harm by detainees is not only a medical 'condition' arising in response to oppression but a form of political action to lessen or contest it. We first establish how self-\-harm could be conceptualised as resistance. We then discuss its political purpose, noting it serves at least three functions: intrinsic, instrumental and disruptive or coercive. Viewing detainee self-\- harm as political resistance is a supplement to (rather than a substitute for) a medical approach. However, conceptualising self-\-harm this way has several advantages, namely, moving away from the idea that such behaviour is 'maladaptive', recognising detainees as political agents, combatting government claims of 'manipulation' and 'blackmail' and clarifying the duties of healthcare workers who work in detention.}
