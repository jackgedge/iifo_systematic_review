in children, whereas the majority of adults will have neu-
rological dysfunction, trauma, alcohol abuse, or psycho-
logical disorders. 1 Much has been written about psychiat-
ric patients engaging in self-mutilation such as cutting and
burning, but little is recorded about deliberate aspiration of
objects in these patients, who clinically can be separated
into 4 groups: (1) malingering, (2) psychosis, (3) pica, and (4)
personality disorders. The immediate psychological gain for
these patients is unclear, as the act is insidious with no evi-
dence of intentional harm or immediate danger. Thus, they
are considered as being parasuicidal events designed to
diminish other psychological processes. 2 Aspirated objects
that are not immediately dislodged by coughing, chok-
ing, or gagging require surgical intervention. Most of these
patients usually come to the attention of a psychiatrist, but
such intervention does not prevent recurrences. We discuss
a schizophrenic patient who aspirated multiple coins while
under psychiatric treatment for prior episodes of aspiration
of coins, ingestion of objects, and insertion of others in his
urethra and rectum, while also reviewing some of the diag-
nostic and therapeutic challenges inherent in the manage-
ment of these patients.",False,,False,

This Study Was Undertaken In Order To Better Define  Clinical Patterns Of Iifo Among Prisoners. We Sought To Determine Factors  Associated With The Need For Endoscopic And Surgical Therapy For Iifo. Methods:  After Obtaining Permission To Conduct Iifo Research In Incarcerated Populations,  Study Patients Were Identified By Icd-9 Codes. Patient Charts Were Reviewed For  Demographics; Past Medical History; Iifo Characteristics; And Diagnostic,  Endoscopic, And Surgical Findings. Univariate And Multivariate Analyses Were  Performed Using Statistical Software. Results: Thirty Patients With 141 Episodes  Of Iifo Were Identified. The Mean Number Of Ingested Items Per Episode Was 4.60.  Endoscopy Was Performed In 97 Of 141 Iifo Instances, With Failure To Retrieve The  Ingested Object In 21 Of 97 Cases (22%). Eleven Instances (7.8%) Required  Surgical Intervention. On Multivariate Analyses, Hospital Admission Was  Associated With Elevated White Blood Cell Count (Odds Ratio [Or] 1.4, P < 0.05)  And Number Of Items Ingested (Or 1.3, P < 0.05). The Need For Endoscopy Was  Independently Associated With Ingestion Of Multiple Objects (Or 3.3, P < 0.05)  And Elevated White Blood Cell Count (Or 1.3, P < 0.05).

Current Literature Lacks Good  Data Documenting Long-Term Outcomes In Children. This Makes It Difficult To  Counsel Some Patients About Realistic Treatment Expectations. The Objective Of  This Study Is To Evaluate Our Institutional Experience And Define The Natural  History And Treatment Outcomes. Methods: A Retrospective Review Of Clinical Data  Obtained From Children Who Underwent Dilation For Ps Was Performed. Results: Over  The Past 30 Years, 114 Children And Adolescents Received 486 Dilations. The Most  Common Indications For Stricture Dilation Were Ps (42%) And Esophageal Atresia  (38%). Other Lesser Indications Included Congenital, Foreign Body, Corrosive,  Cancer, Radiation, Allergic, And Infectious. This Review Focuses On The 48  Children With Ps. Of The Children With Ps, A Congenital Anomaly Was Identified In  23 Children; And 12 Had Neurologic Impairment. Average Age At Presentation Was  10.2 Years (Range, 0.5-18.3 Years). Most Patients Had Had Symptoms For Many  Months Before Diagnosis. Peptic Stricture Was Most Common In The Lower Esophagus  (N = 39). However, Middle (N = 8) And Upper (N = 1) Strictures Were Occasionally  Identified. Noncompliance With Medical Therapy Was A Challenge In 12% (N = 5) Of  Children. Children With A Ps Received A Median Of 3 Dilations, But A Subset Of 5  Patients With Severe Strictures Underwent Up To 48 Dilations (Range, 1-48).  Repeated Dilations Were Required For A Median Of 20 Months (Range, 1-242 Months).  Among Patients Receiving Esophageal Dilation For Ps, 94% Required An Antireflux  Procedure (19% Required A Second Antireflux Surgery). A Subgroup Of Patients (N =  10) Was Identified Who Required Extended Dilations, Multiple Surgeries, And  Esophageal Resection. This Subgroup Had A Significantly Longer Period Of  Symptomatic Disease And Increased Risk Of Esophageal Resection Compared With  Those Patients Requiring Fewer Dilations. Surgical Resection Of The Esophageal  Stricture Was Ultimately Required In 3 Children With Ps After Failure Of More  Conservative Measures. Conclusion: Children And Adolescents Presenting With  Reflux Esophageal Stricture (Ps) Frequently Require Antireflux Surgery, Redo  Antireflux Surgery, And Multiple Dilations For Recurrent Symptoms.

For nearly fifteen years, these institutions have relied on Wild Mammals in Captivity as the essential reference for their work. Now the book reemerges in a completely updated second edition. Wild Mammals in Captivity presents the most current thinking and practice in the care and management of wild mammals in zoos and other institutions. In one comprehensive volume, the editors have gathered the most current information from studies of animal behavior; advances in captive breeding; research in physiology, genetics, and nutrition; and new thinking in animal management and welfare.

In this edition, more than three-quarters of the text is new, and information from more than seventy-five contributors is thoroughly updated. The standard text for all courses in zoo biology, Wild Mammals in Captivity will, in its new incarnation, continue to be used by zoo managers, animal caretakers, researchers, and anyone with an interest in how to manage animals in captive conditions.

Patients And Methods: As Part Of A Larger Study Of  The Effects Of Retained Lead Bullets On Blood Lead, A Retrospective Review Of  Study Findings Was Completed On 5 Of 8 Patients Who Sustained Injuries To The  Maxillofacial Region. These 5 Patients Were Recruited Into The Larger Study  Within 11 Days Of Injury And Showed A Penetration Path For The Projectile That  Engaged The Upper Aerodigestive Tract. All Subjects Were Recruited From Patients  Presenting For Care Of Their Gunshot Injuries To A Large Inner-City Trauma Center  With A Retained Bullet Resulting From A Gunshot Injury. An Initial Blood Lead  Level Was Measured For All Recruited Patients And Repeated 1 To 17 Weeks Later.  Medical History Was Taken Along With A Screening And Risk Factor Questionnaire To  Determine Other Potential Or Actual Sources (Occupational/Recreational) Of Lead  Exposure. (109)Cd K-Shell X-Ray Fluorescence Determinations Of Bone Lead Were  Completed To Determine Past Lead Exposure Not Revealed By Medical History And  Risk Factor Questionnaire. Radiographs Taken Of The Abdomen And Chest, Required  As A Part Of The Patient'S Hospital Care, Were Retrospectively Reviewed For Signs  Of Metallic Fragments Along The Aerodigestive Tract. Results: All 5 Patients  Retained Multiple Lead Pellets Or Fragments At The Site Of Injury, Sustained  Fractures Of The Facial Bones, And Showed Increases In Blood Lead. Three Of The 5  Study Subjects Who Sustained Maxillofacial Gunshot Injuries Involving The Mouth,  Nose, Or Throat Region Showed Metallic Densities Along The Gastrointestinal Tract  Indicative Of Ingested Bullet Fragments. Each Patient With Ingested Bullet  Fragments Showed Rapid Elevation Of Blood Lead Exceeding 25 Microg/Dl And  Sustained Increases Well Beyond The Time When All Ingested Fragments Were  Eliminated. A 3-Year Follow-Up On These 3 Patients Showed Significantly Sustained  Elevation Of Blood Lead But Less Than That Observed During The Initial 6 Months  After Injury. None Of The 5 Study Subjects Showed Any Evidence Of Metallic  Foreign Bodies Within The Tracheobronchial Regions Indicative Of Aspiration.  Conclusion: Ingestion Of Lead Fragments Can Result From Gunshot Injuries To The  Maxillofacial Region And May Substantially Contribute To A Rapid Increase In  Blood Lead Level. Prompt Diagnosis And Elimination Of Ingested Lead Fragments Are  Essential Steps Necessary To Prevent Lead Being Absorbed From The  Gastrointestinal Tract. Increased Blood Lead In Victims After Gunshot Injuries  Must Be Fully Evaluated For All Potential Sources, Including Recent Environmental  Exposure, Absorption Of Lead From Any Remaining Bullets In Body Tissues, And The  Possibility Of Mobilization Of Lead From Long-Term Body Stores Such As Bone.",,True,2.0,True,2.0

The Purpose Of This Article Was To Evaluate The Usefulness Of Ultralow-Dose Chest Ct As An Initial Imaging Study For Evaluation Of Sharp Fish Bone Esophageal Foreign Body (Fb). Materials And Methods. A Total Of 57 Subjects Who Underwent Ultralow-Dose Chest Ct Were Included In This Retrospective Study. All Subjects Had A History Of Ingestion And Symptoms Of Esophageal Fb. All Ultralow-Dose Chest Ct Data Were Reconstructed Twice, Once With Filtered Back Projection (Fbp) And Once With Iterative Reconstruction, And Three Observers Reviewed The Images Independently. Roc Analysis Was Used To Evaluate Diagnostic Performance Of Ultralow-Dose Chest Ct. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (Icc) Was Calculated For Analysis Of Interobserver Agreement. Results. Among 57 Patients, 42 Were Confirmed As Having Esophageal Fb. Significant Objective Noise Reduction Of Mediastinum Was Achieved Using An Iterative Reconstruction Technique. Subjective Image Noise Of Iterative Reconstruction Was Significantly Better Than That Of Fbp. Overall Diagnostic Performance Of Ultralow-Dose Chest Ct For Esophageal Fb Of Iterative Reconstruction (Auc = 0.999) Was Significantly Better Than That Of Fbp (Auc = 0.95) (P = 0.02). Interobserver Agreement Was Greater For Iterative Reconstruction (Icc = 0.944) Than For Fbp (Icc = 0.778). Conclusion. Ultralow-Dose Chest Ct Using Iterative Reconstruction Provided Satisfactory Diagnostic Image Quality For Identifying Fish Bone Esophageal Fb With Reduced Radiation Dose And High Observer Accuracy. Therefore, Ultralow-Dose Chest Ct Would Be Adequate As A First-Line Imaging Modality For Fish Bone Esophageal Fb.",,False,,False,
