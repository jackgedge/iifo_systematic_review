In This Study, Aspiration Of Screwdriver  And Healing Abutment Is Reported With Literature Review. Materials And Methods: A  26-Year-Old Male Patient Was Referred From A Local Dental Clinic With The  Suspicion Of Ingestion Of A Screwdriver And Healing Abutment During The  Second-Stage Surgery. The Patient Reported Symptoms Including Dyspnea, Cough, And  Foreign Body Sensation. On The Chest Radiograph, A Radiopaque Foreign Body  Resembling The Screwdriver And Healing Abutment Was Observed At The Right Mid  Lung. Results: Bronchoscopic Examination Using Flexible Cable Was Performed Under  Conscious Sedation, And Microforceps Were Used To Remove The Instruments.  Aspirated Screwdriver And Healing Abutment Were Removed Safely Under Intravenous  Sedation. The Patient Did Not Have Any Symptoms Associated With Lung Aspiration  After Removal Of The Foreign Body During Follow-Up Periods. Conclusion:  Bronchoscopic Removal Is The Most Recommended Procedure For Removal Of The  Aspirated Foreign Body. This Can Be Performed Under Conscious Sedation.  Precautions, Such As Tethering The Screwdriver, Are Recommended During Implant  Procedures.",,False,,True,2.0,Exclude,"1. Not oral ingestion, 2.

Methods:  Based On The Medical Records Of Patients Younger Than 15 Years Old Who Visited  Emergency Room Because Of Foreign Body Ingestion From January 1999 To December  2012, The Authors Reviewed Clinical Characteristics Including Type Of Ingested  Foreign Bodies, Time To Visits, Managements And Complications. Results: Fishbone  (50.1%) Was The Most Common Ingested Foreign Body In Children. Among 416 Patients  With Ingested Fishbone, 245 (58.9%) Were Identified And Removed Using  Laryngoscope, Rigid Or Flexible Endoscope From Pharynx Or Upper Esophagus By  Otolaryngologists And Pediatric Gastroenterologists. The Kind Of Ingested Fish  Bone In Children Was Diverse. The Mean Age Of Identified And Removed Fishbone  Group Was 7.39 Years Old, And Higher Than That Of Unidentified Fishbone Group  (5.81 Years Old, P<0.001). Identified And Removed Fishbone Group Had Shorter Time  Until Hospital Visit Than The Unidentified Fishbone Group (2.03 Vs. 6.47 Hours,  P<0.001). No Complication Due To Ingested Fishbone Or Procedure Occurred.  Conclusion: Older Age And Shorter Time From Accident To Hospital Visit Were The  Different Factors Between Success And Failure On Removal Of Ingested Fish Bone In  Children.",,False,,True,3.0,Exclude,Not intentional

It Occurs Commonly In Children And Rarely In Adults. High-Risk  Adults Include Illicit Drug Users, Prisoners, Edentulous Adults, Alcoholics,  Psychiatric Patients, Adults With Mental Retardation, Or Those With Decreased  Oral Tactile Sensation. In Adults, Most Foreign Body Impactions Are Seen In  Patients With Pre-Existing Pathologies, Such As Malignancy, Achalasia,  Strictures, And Esophageal Rings. Complications That Foreign Bodies May Cause In  Some Cases Are Tracheoesophageal Fistula, Aorto-Esophageal Fistula, And  Intramural Perforation. This Case Illustrates The Importance Of Including Foreign  Body Ingestion In The Differential Diagnosis Of Dysphagia In High-Risk Groups,  Even When No Clear History Suggests This As A Cause, Which May Decrease The  Complications.",,False,,True,3.0,Exclude,Not intentional

A.",Journal Of Pediatric Surgery,,PubMed,10.1053/jpsu.2001.26381,,Acute Food Bolus Impaction Without Stricture In Children With Gastroesophageal Reflux,"Background/Purpose: This Report Identifies A Group Of Children In Whom Severe Acute Food Bolus Impaction (Afbi) Was The Leading Symptom Of Gastroesophageal  Reflux (Ger) In The Absence Of Stricture. Methods: The Esophageal Structure And  Function Of 8 Patients Treated For Afbi Requiring Endoscopic Removal Of  Alimentary Foreign Bodies In 6 Of Them (Up To 4 Times In 1 Case) Were  Investigated By Barium Meal, Esophagoscopy-Biopsy, Ph-Metering, Pull-Through  Stationary Manometry, And 24-Hour Ambulatory Manometry. The Results Were Compared  With Those In A Group Of Age-Matched Regular Refluxers (N = 14) Without Afbi.  Results: Six Boys And 2 Girls Aged 108 +/- 59 Months Had Impaction. Six Children  Had Symptoms Of Ger Like Vomiting During Infancy, Heartburn, Or Respiratory Tract  Disease. Barium Swallow Ruled Out Stenosis In All Patients And Showed Small  Hiatal Hernias In 3. All Had Endoscopic And Histologic Esophagitis (Moderate To  Severe In 6), And One Had Schatzki Ring. All But One (Who Had 8.45 Mm Hg) Had  Normal Lower Esophageal Sphincter Pressure (16.2 +/- 4.7 Mm Hg, Mean +/- Sd), And  All Showed Normal Sphincteric Relaxation. Esophageal Body Motility Was Not  Significantly Different From That In Regular Refluxers Except In 6 Children In  Whom Energetic Distal Peristalsis After Reflux Episodes Could Be Seen  Particularly During The Night. Three Of Them Had Amazingly Powerful Distal Waves  During The Day And Even Stronger, Simultaneous, Wide And Bizarre-Shaped Waves  During Sleep. Symptoms Improved In All Cases After Antireflux Medication. Four  Patients Were Cured After Antireflux Surgery. Conclusions: Afbi Is A Dramatic But  Practically Unheard Of Symptom Of Ger In Children. It Should Be Differentiated  From Dysphagia And Reveals Motor Dysfunction, Sometimes Severe, Of The Esophageal  Body In The Absence Of Sphincteric Obstruction. Antireflux Medication Or Surgery  Were Uniformly Successful In Our Patients.",,False,,True,2.0,Exclude,"Not intentional, food bolus"
182,2012,"Dipoce, J.","Dipoce, J; Guelfguat, M; Dipoce, J",Radiographics,,Web of Science,10.1148/rg.327125035,,Radiologic Findings In Cases Of Attempted Suicide And Other Self-Injurious Behavior,"Suicide Is One Of The Leading Causes Of Death In Multiple Age Groups. Therefore, It Is Important That Radiologists Be Aware Of This Commonly Encountered Entity. Attempted Suicide May Take A Variety Of Forms; Those Discussed By The Authors Include Sharp Force Injury, Immolation And Inhalation, Ingestion, Hanging, Firearm Use, Jumping From A Height, And Drowning. Certain Radiologic Findings Are Commonly Seen In Cases Of Attempted Suicide And Other Self-Injurious Behaviors. In Some Cases, Especially When The Patient Is Unconscious Or Is Unwilling To Provide A History, It May Not Be Apparent That Suicide Has Been Attempted Until Characteristic Imaging Findings Are Recognized. Correct Identification Of Suicide Attempts On The Basis Of Such Findings Will Ensure That These Patients Receive Appropriate Psychiatric Treatment. When A Suicide Attempt Is Unsuccessful, It Is Important To Be Familiar With The Complications That May Contribute To Delayed Mortality And Morbidity. The Radiologist Plays An Integral Role In The Acute Medical Or Surgical Management Of Patients Who Have Attempted Suicide. In Addition, Imaging Examinations May Provide Useful Forensic Information.

Paediatric Gi Endoscopy Is A Core Competency Every Paediatric  Gastroenterologist Should Possess, And Represents One Of The Most Common  Procedures Performed In Children For Both Diagnostic And Therapeutic Purposes.  Yet There Remains A Dearth Of Literature On The Utility And Outcomes Of  Paediatric Gi Endoscopy In The Asia-Pacific Region. Data On The Diagnostic Value  Of Paediatric Gi Endoscopy Would Be An Important Aspect Of Discussion, With The  Emergence Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ibd) And Eosinophilic Gi Disease As  Increasingly Common Endoscopic Diagnoses. Time-Based Trends In Paediatric Gi  Endoscopy Do Point Towards More Ibd And Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Related  Complications Being Diagnosed, With A Declining Incidence Of Gi Bleeding.  However, The Real-World Diagnostic Value Of Endoscopy In Asia Must Be  Contextualised To The Region-Specific Prevalence Of Paediatric Gi Diseases.  Helicobacter Pylori Infection, Particularly That Of Multidrug-Resistant Strains,  Remains A Highly Prevalent Problem In Specific Regions. Paediatric Functional Gi  Disorders Still Account For The Majority Of Childhood Gi Complaints In Most  Centres, Hence The Diagnostic Yield Of Endoscopy Should Be Critically Evaluated  In The Absence Of Alarm Symptoms. Gi Therapeutic Endoscopy Is Also Occasionally  Required For Children With Ingested Foreign Bodies, Intestinal Polyposis Or  Oesophageal Strictures Requiring Dilation. Endoscopic Haemostasis Is A  Potentially Life-Saving Skill In Cases Of Massive Gi Bleeding Typically From  Varices Or Peptic Ulcers. Advanced Endoscopic Techniques Such As Capsule  Endoscopy And Balloon-Assisted Enteroscopy Have Found Traction, Particularly In  East Asian Centres, As Invaluable Diagnostic And Therapeutic Tools In The  Management Of Ibd, Obscure Gi Bleeding And Intestinal Polyposis. State Of The Art  Endoscopic Diagnostics And Therapeutics, Including The Use Of Artificial  Intelligence-Aided Endoscopy Algorithms, Real-Time Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy  And Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy, Are Expected To Gain More Utility In Paediatrics.  As Paediatric Gastroenterology Matures As A Subspecialty In Asia, It Is Essential  Current Paediatric Endoscopists And Future Trainees Adhere To Minimum Practice  Standards, And Keep Abreast Of The Evolving Trends In The Diagnostic And  Therapeutic Value Of Endoscopy.
