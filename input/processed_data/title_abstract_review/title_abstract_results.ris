Symptoms Were Frequently Severe In  The Prison Inmate Group But, In Contrast, Psychiatric Patients Presented With  Few, If Any, Symptoms. A Majority Of Objects Pass Spontaneously Or Remain In Situ  Without Complication. Twenty-Four Patients Were Discharged Following Initial  Evaluation And Without Specific Treatment. Eight Of These Were Reviewed  Electively And Discharged Within One Week. Twelve Patients Were Admitted For  Observation, Seven Of Whom Were Discharged Within 48 Hrs. Upper Gastrointestinal  Endoscopy Was Performed In Four Patients And An Intragastric Foreign Body  Identified In Two Cases. Laparotomy Was Performed In Two Cases For Unresolving  Mechanical Intestinal Obstruction. Management Should Be Conservative When  Possible, With Surgery Indicated Only For Complications.

JO  - Archives Of Surgery (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)
AB  - Background: We Present Our Experience With An As Yet Undescribed Type Of Intentionally Ingested Metallic Foreign Body That Was Specially Designed To  Arrest In Its Passage And Cause Perforation Of The Gastrointestinal Tract. The  Two Halves Of A Standard Paper Clip Are Tied Crosswise With A Rubber Band,  Forming An Elastic "Cross." With Its Branches Squeezed To Lie Parallel, The Cross  Is Wrapped Into A Small Strip Of Paper And Ingested. After Being Released From  Its Wrapper, The Branches Of The Cross Spring Back To Their Original Position And  Cause Perforation Of The Bowel Wall. Design: Case Series. Setting: University  Hospital, Bulgaria. Patients: Five Male Prisoners From The Same Jail Undergoing  Laparotomy For Foreign Body Removal During 1 Week In January 1994. Interventions:  Laparotomy, Removal Of The Foreign Bodies Through Incisions Of The Bowel Wall,  Immediate Restoration Of The Gastrointestinal Tract Continuity, And Peritoneal  Lavage And Drainage. Outcome Measures: Morbidity And Mortality. Results: Two Of  The Patients Were Initially Observed But Subsequently Underwent Surgery For  Perforations Of The Gastrointestinal Tract. Three Of The Patients Underwent  Immediate Operative Treatment. There Were 20 Total Crosses Ingested; All Foreign  Objects Impacted And Perforated The Stomach (50%), First Duodenal Portion (25%),  And Fourth Duodenal Portion (20%). There Was No Morbidity Or Mortality Among The  Five Patients Treated. Conclusions: Because Ingested Crosses That Have Been  Released From Their Wrappers Never Move Distally, The Only Definitive Solution Is  To Operate Early.

AB  - Background/Purpose: Most Retained Esophageal Foreign Bodies (Fb) Are Identified Soon After Ingestion And Are Easily Extracted. A Minority Of Fb Ingestions Are  Not Identified For Weeks To Years And Present Significant Problems For Retrieval.  The Purpose Of This Study Was To Describe The Diagnostic And Therapeutic  Strategies Needed To Care For Children Who Have Chronic Esophageal Fbs. Methods:  Five Children Were Identified As Having Retained Esophageal Fbs 2 Months To 2  Years After Ingestion. During The Same 3-Year Period, 100 Children Who Had Acute  Fbs Were Identified And Had Their Foreign Bodies Removed Endoscopically. The  Average Age Of The Children Was 3 Years (Range, 2.4 To 3.5). Results: The Average  Age Of The Five Children Identified In This Study Was 3 Years. The Items Ingested  Included Coins, A Heart Pendant, A Clothespin Spring, And A Toy Soldier.  Complications From Chronically Retained Foreign Bodies Were Bronchoesophageal  Fistula, Mediastinitis, Esophageal Diverticulum, And Lobar Atelectasis. One  Patient Died From An Aortoesophageal Fistula. In All Children, Endoscopic Removal  Was Attempted. Barium Esophagram Was Then Performed, And Foreign Bodies Were  Eventually Removed Via Right Thoracotomy. Conclusions: Long-Retained Esophageal  Fbs Are Extremely Morbid And Life Threatening. History Most Often Identifies  Excess Salivation, New Onset Asthma, And/Or Recurrent Upper Respiratory  Infections. Three Diagnostic Adjuncts Are Helpful In Identifying The Presence Of  A Long Retained Fb: (1) Chest X-Ray (Pa And Lateral), (2) Barium Swallow, And (3)  Esophagoscopy. Indications For Thoracotomy For Removal Of Foreign Body Include  (1) Poor Endoscopic Visualization Of Fb Because Of Inflammatory Tissue And (2)  Herald Bleeding During Endoscopy.

AB  - Purpose: The Aim Of This Study Was To Compare The Safety, Efficiency, And Overall Cost Effectiveness Of Esophageal Bougienage Versus Endoscopy In The Retrieval Of  Ingested Coins. Methods: Retrospective Review Of Patients Treated For Esophageal  Coin Ingestion At Children'S Hospital Of Wisconsin Over A 1-Year Period Using  Bougienage Or Endoscopic Retrieval Was Conducted. (Inclusion Criterion) Results:  Twenty-Seven Patients Were Evaluated Over The 1-Year Study Period. Two Patients  Spontaneously Passed The Coins Before Arrival And Needed No Further Treatment.  Twelve Patients Met Criteria For Bougienage, And This Treatment Was Successful In  10 Of The 12 Patients. Mean Length Of Hospital Stay Was 2.15 Hours, And The Mean  Cost Was $546. Thirteen Patients Were Treated Successfully With Endoscopy. The  Mean Length Of Hospital Stay Was 22.7 Hours, And The Mean Cost Was $5,230. There  Were No Complications In Any Of The 25 Patients. Conclusions: Bougienage Is  Equally Safe, More Efficient, And Much Less Expensive Than Endoscopy For  Treatment Of Esophageal Coins In Properly Selected Patients. Nearly Half Of The  Patients Were Excluded From Bougienage Because Of Delayed Presentation Alone.  Education Of Parents And Physicians Regarding Symptoms Of Coin Ingestion Would  Allow Primary Treatment With Bougienage In The Majority Of Cases.

JO  - Journal Of Pediatric Surgery
AB  - Background/Purpose: This Study Aims To Elucidate The Clinical Presentation, The Effectiveness Of Investigations, And Treatment Of Foreign Body Ingestion In  Children And To Formulate An Algorithm Of Management. Methods: The Records Of  Children Admitted To A Single Institution Who Had A History Of Foreign Body  Ingestion Over 33 Years Were Reviewed. Symptoms, Radiological Findings, And  Endoscopic Findings Were Assessed. Results: Foreign Bodies Were Detected In 552  (43%) Of The 1,265 Children Admitted. The Age Of The Children Ranged From 6  Months To 16 Years (Mean, 5.2 Years). The Preschool Toddlers (Mean Age, 3.8  Years) Were Most Prone To Ingest Inanimate Objects. The Most Common Objects Were  Coins (49%) And Nonmetallic Sharp Objects (Nmso; 31%). Although X-Rays Could  Detect All The Metallic Objects And 86% Of Glass Objects, The Sensitivity Of Fish  Bone Detection Is Only 26%. Absence Of Symptoms Was Common (50% In Metallic Group  And 29% In Nmso Group). Forty-One Percent Of Coins And 95% Of Nmso Were Lodged At  Sites Suitable For Removal By Direct Laryngoscopy Alone With Success Rates Of 86%  And 77%, Respectively. There Were 3 Disease-Related Complications And 1  Mortality. Two Of These Children Were Mentally Retarded And Presented Late.  Conclusions: Efforts For Prevention Of Ingestion Of Inanimate Foreign Body Should  Focus On The Preschool Toddler Group. Particular Attention Should Be Paid To  Mentally Retarded Children With Vague Gastrointestinal Symptoms. Absence Of  Symptoms Does Not Preclude Presence Of Foreign Body In Children. Children With  History Of Nmso Ingestion Should Undergo Direct Laryngoscopy Despite Negative  Radiological Finding, Both As A Screening Procedure Or Treatment.

AB  - Background And Study Aims: Bezoars Are Collections Of Indigestible Foreign Material That Are Found Within The Gastrointestinal Tract. Nonoperative  Approaches Such As Dietary Therapy, Enzymatic Dissolution, And Endoscopic Removal  Have Been Regarded As The Mainstays Of Therapy. The Purpose Of This Paper Is To  Determine The Efficacy Of Electrohydraulic Lithotripsy (Ehl) As An Alternative  Form Of Treatment Of Gastric Bezoars. Patients And Methods: Between July 1988 And  May 1996, 11 Patients With Large Gastric Bezoars, Defined As Those Greater Than 5  Cm In Diameter, Received Endoscopic-Guided Fragmentation Using Electrohydraulic  Lithotripsy. Nine Of Our Patients Had A History Of Ingestion Of "Pho Pu Zi",  (Cordia Dichotoma Frost. F.), One Of Orange Pitch, And One Of Ingestion Of  Persimmon. Results: The 11 Patients In The Study Underwent Ehl For The Treatment  Of Their Gastric Bezoars, With A 100% Success Rate, Which Was Defined As The Lack  Of Residual Bezoar Seen On Post-Procedure Barium Study Or Endoscopy Done 2 Days  After The Procedure. Patients Were Followed-Up Clinically For 30-68 Months, With  Seven Of The 11 Patients Undergoing A Barium Study With No Residual Bezoar Noted.  No Procedure-Related Complications Were Seen, Except For Pharyngeal Pain Which  Was Most Probably Secondary To The Placement Of The Silicon Overtube.  Conclusions: Endoscopically Guided Electrohydraulic Lithotripsy Is A Safe, Highly  Effective, Alternative Nonsurgical Technique For The Treatment Of Gastric  Bezoars.

AB  - Purpose: The Purpose Of This Report Is To Describe Our Experience In Management Of Aortoesophageal Fistulas (Aef) With Special Emphasis On The Value Of In Situ Aortic Allograft Replacement. Patients: Nine Patients Presenting With Aef Were Observed Between May 1988 And April 2002. There Were 4 Men And 5 Women With A Mean Age Of 54.3 Years (Range, 32-77 Years). Six Patients Presented Secondary Aef After Aortic Repair. Two Patients Presented Primary Aef After Rupture Of An Atherosclerotic Aneurysm Into The Esophagus. In The Remaining Patient, Aef Was Caused By Swallowing A Fishbone. In 6 Cases Involving True Aef With A Direct Communication Between The Aorta And Esophagus, Massive Exsanguinating Hematemesis Occurred. It Was Usually Preceded By Minor Sentinel Bleeding, Two Patients Presented Esophagoparaprosthetic Fistula (Eppf). One Patient Presented Primary Aef That Was Contained By A Large Thrombus In The Communication. The Clinical Picture In These 3 Patients Involved Severe Sepsis Without Hemorrhage. Results: Two Patients Died As A Result Of Massive Hemorrhage Before Assessment And Surgical Treatment Could Be Undertaken. One 77-Year-Old Woman Presenting Eppf Refused To Undergo Surgery And Died Because Of Infection. The Remaining 6 Patients Underwent Surgical Treatment With Various Outcomes. One Man Died During Thoracotomy Caused By Exsanguinating Hemorrhage. One Woman Presenting Eppf Was Treated By Exclusion Followed By Ascending Aorta To Abdominal Aorta Bypass Grafting, Removal Of The Prosthesis, Esophageal Exclusion, And Directed Esophageal Fistula. She Died Of Infection. The Other 4 Patients Were Treated By In Situ Aortic Allograft Replacement. The Damaged Esophagus Was Repaired By Using The Tha1 Technique In 1 Patient. In The Remaining 3 Cases Subtotal Esophagectomy Was Performed In Association With Cervical Esophagostomy, Ligation Of The Abdominal Esophagus, Gastrostomy, And Jejunostomy. One Patient Died Of Sepsis During The First 24 Hours After The Operation. The Other 3 Patients Underwent Secondary Esophagoplasty And Survived With No Further Sign Of Infection. Mean Duration Of Follow-Up In The Survivor Group Was 53 Months (Range, 15-95 Months). Overall 6 Patients, Including 3 That Did Not Undergo Surgical Treatment, Died And 3 Patients Survived. Conclusion: Our Experience Confirms That Aef Is A Rare But Catastrophic Disorder. In Situ Allograft Replacement Usually In Association With Subtotal Esophagectomy Appears To Be An Excellent Salvage Modality Whenever Emergency Surgery Is Feasible.

AB  - Purpose: To Analyze The Utility Of Helical Computed Tomography (Ct) In The Diagnosis Of Suspected Upper Esophageal Foreign Bodies. Material And Methods: A Prospective Study Was Performed On 36 Patients (26 F, 10 M, Mean Age 70 Years) With A History Of Foreign Body Impaction. All Had Negative Findings At Indirect Laryngoscopy. Radiologic Assessment Included Unenhanced Helical Ct And A Barium Contrast Study. Patients With Positive Findings Were Taken To Esophagoscopy. All Patients Had A Posterior Clinical Surveillance. Results: Twenty Patients Had Both Normal Ct And Barium Study And Satisfactory Clinical Outcome. In 12 Patients A Foreign Body Was Noted In The Cervical Esophagus By Ct, Barium Study, And Endoscopy. In One Patient A Fish Bone Was Detected By Ct (And Not By Barium) Confirmed With Esophagoscopy. Another Patient Bad A Fish Bone Esophageal Perforation Which Was Observed Only By Ct And Confirmed At Surgery. Two Patients With Normal Barium And Endoscopy Presented A False-Positive Ct Result. Conclusion: Barium Swallow Is Currently The First Radiologic Study, But May Involve A Risk Of Aspiration And Can Impede A Subsequent Esophagoscopy. Esophagoscopy Is An Invasive Technique With A Certain Risk Of Serious Complications That Can Be Avoided With A Satisfactory Radiologic Assessment. Ct Is Easy, Fast, Has 100% Sensitivity And Is Therefore The First Choice Technique For Diagnosing Suspected Upper Esophageal Foreign Bodies Not Expected To Be Visible On Plain Radiographs.

AB  - Objective: Foreign Body Ingestion Is Not An Uncommon Problem In Children. Children Can Ingest Various Foreign Objects. One Of Such Objects Is Safety Pin,  Which Is Not Widely Reported In The Literature. The Purpose Of This Study Is To  Consider The Efficacy Of Magill Forceps For Removal Of Safety Pins From Upper  Esophagus. Methods: A Retrospective Chart Review Was Conducted For All Children  Admitted To Our Hospital With Safety Pin Ingestion From 1995 To 2003. In 58  Children Who Had Been Found To Ingest Safety Pin, The Attachment Site Was  Gastrointestinal Tract. In 12 Of The Cases, Safety Pins Were Located In The Upper  End Of The Esophagus. In Seven Of The Children Safety Pin Extraction Was Achieved  By Using A Magill Forceps With The Assistance Of A Laryngoscope Maintaining  General Anesthesia With Mask Inhalation. Results: Safety Pins Were Successfully  Removed With Magill Forceps Without Any Complications In Seven Patients Whom They  Were Located In The Upper Esophagus. Upper Esophageal Safety Pins In The Other  Five Patients Were Extracted With Rigid Esophagoscopy For They Were Not Seen  Under Direct Laryngoscopy. There Were No Complications. Conclusions: This Is A  Preliminary Report, But We Believe That The Magill Forceps Technique For The  Removal Of Safety Pin In The Upper End Of The Esophagus Is Safe And Minimally  Invasive Method Compared To Rigid Esophagoscopy.

Only After Computed Tomography (Ct) Scanning Of The Abdomen And  Pelvis Did The Patient Admit To Deliberate Ingestion Of A Single United States  Penny Coin. During Surgical Evaluation It Was Found That The Coin Had Lodged Near  The Ileocecal Valve And An Inflammatory Mass Had Formed Around The Intraluminal  Coin, Causing A 10 X 7 Cm Fibrous Tumor To Completely Obstruct The Small Bowel.  It Is Thought That Oxidation Of The Coin, With Subsequent Exposure Of Its High  Zinc Content, Instigated The Inflammatory Cascade.

JO  - Current Gastroenterology Reports
AB  - Ingestion Of Foreign Bodies Is A Common Pediatric Problem, With More Than 100,000 Cases Occurring Each Year. The Vast Majority Of Pediatric Ingestions Are  Accidental; Increasing Incidence Of Intentional Ingestions Starts In The  Adolescent Age Group. In The United States, The Most Common Pediatric Foreign  Bodies Ingested Are Coins, Followed By A Variety Of Other Objects, Including  Toys, Toy Parts, Sharp Objects, Batteries, Bones, And Food. In Adolescents And  Adults, Meat Or Food Impactions Are The Most Common Accidental Foreign Body  Ingestion. Esophageal Pathology Underlies Most Cases Of Food Impaction.  Management Of Foreign Body Ingestions Varies Based On The Object Ingested, Its  Location, And The Patient'S Age And Size. Esophageal Foreign Bodies As A Group  Require Early Intervention Because Of Their Potential To Cause Respiratory  Symptoms And Complications, Esophageal Erosions, Or Even An Aortoesophageal  Fistula. Ingested Batteries That Lodge In The Esophagus Require Urgent Endoscopic  Removal Even In The Asymptomatic Patient Due To The High Risk Of Complications.  Sharp Foreign Bodies Increase The Foreign Body Complication Rate From Less Than  1% To 15% To 35%, Except For Straight Pins, Which Usually Follow A Relatively  Benign Course Unless Multiple Pins Are Ingested. Magnets Are Increasingly  Ingested, Due To Their Ubiquitous Nature And The Perception That They Do Not Pose  A Risk. Ingestion Of Multiple Magnets Creates A Significant Risk Of Obstruction,  Perforation, And Fistula Development. Methods To Deal With Foreign Bodies Include  The Suture Technique, The Double Snare Technique, And The Combined Forceps/Snare  Technique For Long, Large, And Sharp Foreign Bodies, Along With Newer Equipment,  Such As Retrieval Nets And A Variety Of Specialized Forceps.

JO  - Pediatric Emergency Care
AB  - Objective: The Purpose Of This Study Was To Describe The Clinical Presentation Of Children With Either An Unwitnessed Or Witnessed Esophageal Foreign Body.  Methods: Retrospective Chart Review Was Performed. Patients Were Identified Using  Icd-9 Code For Esophageal Foreign Body. Clinical Data And Management Techniques,  Along With Complications Were Abstracted. Results: For The 5-Year Period Of  Review, 255 Patients Were Identified With An Esophageal Foreign Body. 214  Children Had A Witnessed Ingestion. The Mean Age Of The Unwitnessed Ingestion  Group Was 2.3 Years, Compared To 4.6 Years For A Witnessed Ingestion. In Both  Groups, Males And Females Were Distributed Equally And The Most Common Ingested  Object Was A Coin. Bivariate, Unadjusted Analysis Revealed That History Of Wheeze  (Or, 4.35) And Fever (Or, 11.15) Had The Largest Association With Patients Who  Had An Unwitnessed Ingestion. Multivariate Analysis Indicated That Any Physical  Findings Of Wheeze, Rhonchi, Stridor, Or Retractions Were Associated  Significantly With A Diagnosis Of An Unwitnessed Foreign Body. Children Less Than  2 Years Of Age And With A Documented Fever Are Also Predictive Of An Unwitnessed  Ingestion. Eleven Children (4.3%) With Esophageal Abnormalities Were Also Noted  To Have Foreign Bodies. Conclusions: Children Who Present To The Emergency  Department Two Years Old And Younger, Who Have A Documented Fever And With  Respiratory Findings Should Be Considered At Risk For Having A Retained  Esophageal Foreign Body. Children With Esophageal Abnormalities May Also Be At  Risk For Retained Esophageal Foreign Bodies.

AB  - Purpose: To Investigate The Cases Of Foreign Body In The Aerodigestive Tract And To Elucidate The Characteristic Problems In India. Design And Setting: Three  Hundred Patients Presenting With A History Of Either Aspirating Or Swallowing A  Foreign Body Were Analyzed In A Tertiary Care Center. Data Were Collected By  Retrospective Chart Review And Statistically Analyzed. Results: Of The 300  Patients Studied, 90% (270 Cases) Did Have A Retained Foreign Body, With 233  (86.2%) Cases Found In The Pharyngoesophagus And 37 (13.7%) Cases In The  Tracheobronchial Tree. With Foreign Bodies In The Tracheobronchial Passages, The  Most Common Sign And Symptom Were Rhonchi (50%) And Dyspnea (67%), Respectively;  In Pharyngoesophagus, The Most Common Symptom And Sign Were Dysphagia (64%) And  Odynophagia (45%), Respectively. The Most Common Foreign Body Found Was Fish Bone  In 39% (106 Cases) And The Most Common Site Of Lodgment Was The Cervical  Esophagus 50.5% (136 Cases). Rigid Endoscopy With Forceps Removal Under General  Anesthesia Was The Main Treatment Modality. Thirty-Three (12.2%) Cases Had  Complications Secondary To Retained Foreign Body. Conclusion: Foreign Bodies In  The Aerodigestive Tract Continue To Be A Common Problem Affecting Adults And  Children Alike. Rigid Endoscopies With Forceps Removal Under General Anesthesia  Are The Preferred Management Modality. From Their Experience, The Authors  Recommend That No Foreign Body In The Upper Aerodigestive Tract Should Be Left  Alone With The Hope That It Will Come Out Spontaneously. Delay In Diagnosis And  Management Can Lead To Life-Threatening Complications.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Coins Are The Most Commonly Ingested Foreign Body Encountered In The Pediatric Population. Coins That Are In The Esophagus And Are Causing  Symptoms (Cough, Stridor, Respiratory Distress, Drooling Or Pain) Are Managed  With Immediate Removal Via Various Methods. Asymptomatic Coins Have Been A  Perplexing Problem To The Clinician For Decades, With Some Advocating For  Immediate Removal While Others Are Proponents Of "Watchful Waiting". Recent  Findings: This Article Will Provide A Review Of The Current Literature On  Management Options For Symptomatic And Asymptomatic Esophageal Coins. The Article  Will Discuss Clinical Decision-Making Strategies For The Diagnosis Of The  Unwitnessed Ingestion, As Well As Diagnostic Studies, Such As Plain Radiographs,  As Well As Novel Modalities, Such As Metal Detectors. Discussion Of The Anatomic  Issues Related To Esophageal Foreign Bodies Will Be Addressed. Treatment Options  For Asymptomatic Patients Will Be Reviewed Utilizing Data From Retrospective  Studies As Well As A Prospective Randomized Trial. Summary: In The Symptomatic  Patient With An Esophageal Coin, Immediate Removal Via Endoscopy Is Recommended.  For The Asymptomatic Patient With An Esophageal Coin, Current Data Support  Expectant Management For A Period Of 12-24 H With The Hope Of Spontaneous Passage  And Avoidance Of General Anesthesia And Surgical Procedure.

AB  - Purpose: Foreign Body Ingestion Is A Common Problem In Both Children And Adults. This Study Aims To Evaluate A Management Protocol Where Endoscopic Examination  Was Only Selectively Used After Routine Direct Laryngoscopy To Minimize Patient  Discomfort And The Need For General Anesthesia In Children. Method: A Management  Protocol For Foreign Body Ingestion Based On Symptoms Was Introduced In 1998 And  Records Of Children Admitted To A University-Affiliated Hospital Between January  1999 And October 2005 With Suspected Foreign Body Ingestion Were Evaluated.  Symptoms, Radiologic And Endoscopic Findings, And Outcome Were Reviewed. Results:  A Total Of 282 Patients Were Admitted. The Mean Age Of Patients Was 5.75 Years  (Range, 9 Months To 17 Years). There Were 167 Boys And 115 Girls. Based On Our  Protocol, 84 (29.8%) Patients Required An Upper Endoscopy. Fish Bones Were Most  Commonly Involved (68.8%). Foreign Bodies, Which Were Either Removed Or  Dislodged, Were Found During Upper Endoscopy In Only 25 (8.8%) Patients Overall.  All Patients Had An Uneventful Outcome. No Complications Or Mortalities Were  Encountered. There Were No Readmissions For Those Who Did Not Undergo Endoscopic  Examination. Conclusion: It Is Safe To Selectively Perform Upper Endoscopy  Depending On Symptoms When Managing Children With Foreign Body Ingestion.

AB  - Purpose: In Our Country, Safety Pin Ingestion By Infants Is Commonplace. When Swallowed, Open Safety Pins Are Mostly Found Within The Esophagus Or Stomach, And  They Cannot Be Easily Removed By Rigid Esophagogastroscopy. Our Aim Was To  Evaluate The Removal Of Safety Pins Using Flexible Endoscopy In Infants.  Materials And Methods: We Evaluated The Cases Of 7 Infants Who Had Ingested Open  Safety Pins Between 2001 And 2004. In All The Patients, The Primary Diagnostic  Tool Was A Direct X-Ray Of The Neck, Chest, And Abdomen. In All Cases, The Safety  Pins Were Removed By Flexible Esophagogastroduo-Denoscopy. Clinical Records For  The Cases Were Reviewed. Results: Four Of The Open Safety Pins Were Lodged In The  Esophagus, Two In The Stomach, And One In The Duodenum. One Infant Had A Safety  Pin Lodged In The Esophagus With The Pin'S Open End Pointed Caudally; The Pin Was  Held With The Endoscopic Forceps By Its Tail End And Removed. Three Safety Pins  In The Esophagus Had Their Open Ends Pointing Cephalad; These Were Held By Their  Tail Ends Using The Endoscopic Forceps And Pushed Into The Stomach. Then They  Were Rotated In The Stomach And Removed Tail End First. The Safety Pins Located  In The Stomach Or Duodenum Were Also Removed Similarly. All Safety Pins Were  Successfully Removed, And There Were No Operative Complications. Conclusion: Open  Surgery Or Other Invasive Removal Methods Are Not Necessary In Infants With Open  Safety Pin Ingestions. In Our Opinion, The Best Way To Extract An Open Safety Pin  From The Esophagus, Stomach, Or Duodenum Is By Using A Flexible Endoscopic  Device.

AB  - Objective: The Discovery Of Foreign Bodies (Fb) In The Rectum Is An Infrequent Clinical Problem. Most Commonly, Fb Are Introduced Through The Anal Passage Or  Reach The Rectum After Oral Ingestion. We Describe Our Experience In The  Diagnosis And Treatment Of Fb Retained In The Rectum. Method: From 1997 To 2004,  Data Were Collected Prospectively In 30 Patients (20 Men And 10 Women; Median Age  42.5 Years). Extraction Method, Size And Type Of Object, And Postextraction  Evolution Were Reviewed. Results: The Fb Was Introduced Anally In 16 Cases And By  Oral Ingestion In 14. Principal Associated Factors Were: Mental Disorder In 11,  Penitentiary Confinement In Two, And Drug And Alcohol Intake In Two. Recent  Sexual Activity Had Taken Place In 14 Cases. The Size And Nature Of The Fb Were  Varied. The Most Frequent Symptom Was Constipation With Or Without Pelvic Or Anal  Discomfort (N = 23, 77%). Treatment Consisted Of Spontaneous Ejection (N = 2),  Digital Extraction With Or Without Enemas (N = 10), Digital Extraction Under  Local/Regional Anaesthesia After Fragmentation (N = 11) And Regional Exploratory  Laparotomy Under General Anaesthesia (N = 7). Grade I Rectal Trauma Was The Most  Common (N = 23, 77%). Six Patients Required Colostomy. Four Patients (13.5%)  Suffered Complications And None Died. Only 17 Patients Were Hospitalized, With A  Mean Stay Of 6 Days. All Patients Recovered Without Sequelae. Conclusion: The  Diagnosis Of Rectal Fb Should Be Suspected When Faced With Low Pelvic Or Perianal  Abdominal Pain And/Or Rectal Haemorrhage Within The Context Of An Unconvincing  Story In Patients Without A History Of Recent Instrumental Rectal Exploration For  Therapeutic Or Diagnostic Purposes. Because Of Potential Complications, Fb In The  Rectum Should Be Considered A Serious Condition That Must Be Treated Without  Delay.

AB  - Background: Foreign Body Ingestion Is A Common Pediatric Problem. Coins Are By Far The Most Common Ingested Foreign Bodies. When Ingested Coins Become Lodged In  The Esophagus, They May Cause Serious Complications If They Are Not Removed In A  Timely Manner. Endoscopic Removal Is The Preferred Treatment In Many Pediatric  Centers As Its Safety And Effectiveness Are Well Established. Objectives: We  Performed This Study To Evaluate Safety And Effectiveness Of An Alternative  Method Of Managing Esophageal Coins, Using Bougienage Technique. Methods:  Previously Healthy Children Presenting To The Local Emergency Room With  Uncomplicated, Witnessed Coin Ingestion Of Less Than 24 Hours Duration Were  Prospectively Recruited With An Intent-To-Treat Analysis. A Single Oral Passage  Of A Hurst Bougie Dilator Was Performed By A Gastroenterologist To Dislodge The  Esophageal Coin Into The Stomach. If Bougienage Was Successful (X-Ray Showing  Coin In The Stomach), Patients Were Discharged And Instructions Were Given For  Monitoring Stools Until Passage Of The Coin Through Anus Was Confirmed. If  Bougienage Was Unsuccessful, The Child Developed Symptoms At Any Time Or If A  Coin Remained Intragastric For 4 Weeks, Endoscopic Removal Was Planned. Children  Whose Parents Declined To Participate In The Bougienage Treatment Received The  Standard Endoscopic Removal And Their Hospital Records Were Used As Controls.  Results: A Total Of 10 Children Were Enrolled In This Study, With A Mean Age Of  3.2 Years (11 Mo To 10 Y), 6 Boys And 4 Girls. All Received Little Or No  Sedation. Nine Children (90%) Were Successfully Treated Using Bougienage, All Of  Whom Spontaneously Passed The Ingested Coins, With A Mean Duration Of 2.6 Days (1  To 7 D) Without Subsequent Intervention. A Single Case Failed Bougienage And  Underwent Endoscopic Removal. Three Children Declined Bougienage Treatment And  Underwent Endoscopic Removal. There Were No Reported Minor Or Major Adverse  Events With Any Of Our Cases. The Mean Health Care Cost For The Hospital Visit  For Bougienage Treatment Was $1210, Compared With $3100 For The Endoscopic  Removal (P<0.001). Furthermore, The Mean Time Spent In The Hospital From  Diagnosis To Discharge Was 2 Hours For Bougienage-Treated Patients Compared With  8 Hours For Endoscopic Treatment (P<0.001). Conclusions: Bougienage Of Impacted  Esophageal Coins Is An Effective, Safe, And More Economic Treatment Modality For  Selected Pediatric Patients With Uncomplicated Coin Ingestion. This Simple  Technique May Provide A Valuable Tool To Emergency Room Physicians Or Primary  Care Doctors Especially When Endoscopy Is Not Readily Available.

AB  - Gastrointestinal And Bronchial Foreign Bodies May Cause Significant Clinical Complications With A High Degree Of Morbidity. In Adults, A Large Variety Of  Foreign Bodies Are Accidentally Or Intentionally Ingested, Inserted Or Aspirated.  In The Majority Of Cases, The Objects Are Expelled Conservatively By Coughing,  Vomiting Or Bowel Movements. The Risk For Obstruction, Perforation And  Penetration Depends Upon The Type Of Object, Those With Sharp Edges Or Tips  Having The Highest Risk. In These Situations, The Objects Have To Be Removed By  An Endoscopic Or An Operative Intervention. We Present Four Foreign Body Stories  Including A Young Lady Who Swallowed A Pen During Sleep, A Farmer Who Inserted A  Corncob Into The Rectum Because Of Intractable Diarrhoea, An Elderly Gentleman  Who Aspirated A Dental Bridge While Laughing And A Cocain Body Packer Who Was  Caught At The Border. Back Ground, Complications And Removal Procedures Of The  Four Cases Are Discussed.

AB  - Acquired Tracheoesophageal Fistulas (Tef) Are Rare But Dangerous Complications Of Disc-Battery Ingestion. Management Approaches Include Endoscopic Or Open Surgical  Repair. Unfortunately, These Procedures Can Be Complicated By High Rates Of  Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Injury, Tracheal Stenosis, Recurrent Fistula And  Significant Patient Mortality. Thus, Several Authors Have Advocated The Use Of  Esophageal Rest As Conservative Management Of Acquired Tef To Permit Closure By  Secondary Intention. This Study Describes A Patient With Spontaneous Closure Of  An Acquired Tef Following Disc-Battery Ingestion. The Late Recurrence Of The Tef  Following Conservative Management, And Endoscopic And Radiographic Evidence Of  Closure, Illustrates The Importance Of Long Term Evaluation Before Assuming  Fistula Resolution. Practitioners Must Carefully Weigh The Risks And Benefits  Before Deciding Surgical Versus Conservative Management Of Tef. An Extended  Follow-Up Of At Least 6 Months Should Be Instituted With A High Index Of  Suspicion If Conservative Management Is Utilized. Transtracheal Repair Using An  Imbricated Suture Technique Is A Good Surgical Option When Conservative  Management Fails.

AU  - Schrom, T.

JO  - Laryngo- Rhino- Otologie
AB  - Introduction: Foreign Bodies In The Oesophagus Represent A Frequent Emergency Situation In Ent Medicine. Usually The Cases Involve Lumps Of Meat, Bones, Shards  Of Glass, Bottle Tops, Batteries Or Dentures. We Would Like To Report About An  Unusual Foreign Body Found In The Oesophagus. Patient: A 45-Year-Old Patient  Presented Himself In Our Interdisciplinary Casualty Department Where He Claimed  To Have Swallowed A Butter-Knife That Morning As A Bet. The Ent Examination  Showed No Abnormal Findings. The Thorax X-Ray Revealed A 14 Cm-Long Foreign Body  In Projection To The Oesophagus, Which Matched The Knife. Following Consultation  With The Thorax Surgeon, A Rigid Oesophagoscopy Was Conducted Under Endotracheal  Intubation And The Knife Was Easily Removed Using Tongs. Archive Searches  Conducted In The Meantime Showed That Foreign Bodies Had Been Removed From The  Patient On Numerous Occasions By Fellow Surgeons Either Laparoscopically Or Via  Open Surgery. As A Result, The Patient Was Transferred To The Psychiatric Ward  With Unimpeded Swallowing Reflex With A Suspected Self-Harming Syndrome.  Discussion: As An Ent Emergency, A Foreign Body In The Oesophagus Generally  Requires Intervention Because Of The Risk Of Complications Such As Perforation Or  Pressure-Induced Necrosis Of The Oesophagus Wall With Resulting Mediastinitis.  Suitable Instruments Are The Flexible Oesophagoscope, The Rigid Oesophagoscope  Under Anaesthesia Or Transcervical/Transthoracic Removal. The Choice Of Procedure  Crucially Depends On The Type And Localisation Of The Foreign Body In The  Oesophagus. Particularly In Cases Of Unusual Foreign Objects Or Repeated Foreign  Object Ingestion, It Should Be Considered Whether A Psychological Illness Could  Be The Cause And Whether The Introduction Of Appropriate Therapy Could Be  Expedient.

AB  - Background: Previous Reports Of Foreign-Body Ingestions Focused Primarily On Accidental Ingestions. Objective: To Describe The Characteristics And Management  Of Foreign-Body Ingestions, With Predominantly Intentional Ingestion, In A Lower  Socioeconomic Status Population. Design: A Retrospective Case Series. Setting: An  Urban County Hospital. Patients: Patients >/=17 Years Old, With Foreign-Body  Ingestions Between 2000 And 2006. Main Outcome Measurements: Characteristics Of  Ingestion Cases, Endoscopic Extraction, Need For Surgery, And Complications.  Results: Among 262 Cases, 92% Were Intentional, 85% Involved Psychiatric  Patients, And 84% Occurred In Patients With Prior Ingestions. The Time From  Ingestion To Presentation Was >48 Hours In 168 Cases (64%). The Overall Success  Rate For Endoscopic Extraction Was 90% (165/183 Cases). Surgery Was Performed In  30 Cases (11%) And Was More Common For Objects Beyond The Pylorus Versus Objects  Above The Pylorus (16/43 [37%] Vs 10/151 [7%], Respectively) And In Cases With A  Greater Delay From Ingestion To Presentation (25/168 [15%] If >48 Hours Vs 4/77  [5%] If </=48 Hours) And From Presentation To Intervention (15/40 [38%] If >48  Hours Vs 14/165 [8%] If </=48 Hours). Perforation Occurred In 16 Cases (6%), With  6 Perforations Noted After Endoscopy. Limitation: A Retrospective Review Of  Medical Records. Conclusions: Foreign-Body Ingestions In An Urban County Hospital  Occurred Primarily In Psychiatric Patients Who Had Repeated Episodes Of  Intentional Ingestions. Endoscopic Extraction Was Unsuccessful In 10% Of Cases.  Long Delays From Ingestion To Presentation And Intervention May Account For  Relatively High Rates Of Surgery And Perforation. Strategies To Prevent  Ingestions And Delays In Endoscopic Management Are Needed In This Population.

Materials And Methods: Over A Two-Year Period, Asian Patients With Suspected  Foreign Body Ingestion Were Studied. The Clinical Findings, Computed Tomography  Images, Endoscopic Results, Treatment And Outcomes Were Prospectively Analysed.  Results: Over The Study Period, 193 Patients Were Admitted For Foreign Body  Ingestion, Complaining Of A Persistent Foreign Body Sensation In The Neck. The  Sensitivity And Specificity Of Computed Tomography Were 78 And 96 Per Cent,  Respectively; The Positive Predictive Value Was 75 Per Cent And The Negative  Predictive Value 97 Per Cent. The Diagnostic Accuracy Of Computed Tomography Was  94 Per Cent. Conclusion: Our Study Showed That Computed Tomography Had High  Negative Predictive Value And Accuracy In The Diagnosis Of Foreign Body  Ingestion. It Was Useful If Endoscopy Showed Negative Findings But The Patient  Still Had Persistent Symptoms Of Foreign Body Ingestion.

AB  - Deliberate Single Foreign Body Ingestion Is A Scenario That Many Gastroenterologists Commonly See In Psychiatric Units And Prisons. However,  Multiple Foreign Body Ingestions, Especially Located In The Duodenum, Provide The  Endoscopist With Unique Challenges For Management And Treatment. Although Most  Foreign Objects Pass Spontaneously, One Should Have A Low Threshold Of  Intervention For Multiple Objects, Especially Those That Are Wide, Sharp And At  Risk Of Perforation. Diagnosis Is Typically Made When There Is A History Of  Ingestion Coupled With Corresponding Radiographic Verification. The Symptoms Tend  To Be Non-Specific Although Some Patients Are Able To Delineate Where The  Discomfort Level Is, Correlating With The Site Of Impaction. Most Foreign Bodies  Pass Spontaneously; However When Multiple Sharp Objects Are Ingested, The  Gastroenterologist Should Perform Endoscopic Procedures To Minimize The Risks Of  Bowel Perforation. We Describe Here A Successful Case Of Multiple Ingested  Foreign Bodies Retrieved Across The C-Loop Of The Duodenum And The  Pharynges-Esophageal Curve Via Endoscopy And Review The Literature Of Multiple  Foreign Body Ingestion.

AB  - Background & Aims: Guidelines Support Endoscopic Removal Of Certain Gastric Foreign Bodies (Fbs) And All Fbs Lodged In The Esophagus. We Studied The Poorly  Understood Group Of Patients Who Intentionally Ingest Fbs. Methods: Cases Of  Intentional Ingestion Of Fbs (N = 305) Were Identified, Retrospectively, From An  Electronic Endoscopy Database And Followed. Cases Occurred Among 33 Different  Patients, Who Underwent Endoscopy From October 1, 2001, To July 31, 2009 (39.0  Cases/Year); 79% Were Diagnosed With A Psychiatric Disorder. Financial Cost  Analysis Was Performed Using Hospital Billing And Cost Systems. Results: Commonly  Ingested Fbs Included Pens (23.6%), Batteries (9.2%), Knives (7.2%), And Razor  Blades (6.9%). Most Endoscopic Procedures Were Performed Under General  Anesthesia. Fbs Were Commonly Retrieved By Snares (58.0%), Rat-Toothed Forceps  (14.4%), And Nets (11.5%), Assisted Sometimes By Use Of Overtubes (10.8%), And  Hoods (4.6%). Fb Extraction Was Unsuccessful At The Initial Endoscopy In Only 20  Cases; 2 Cases Eventually Required Surgical Extraction. Minor Complications  Occurred In 11 Endoscopies. There Were No Deaths Or Perforations. The Total  Estimated Costs Were $2,018,073 ($1,500,627 In Hospital Costs, $240,640 In  Physician Fees, And $276,806 For Security Services). Costs Were Significantly  Higher For Inpatients. Major Payers Were Medicare (48%) And Medicaid (31%).  Conclusions: Intentional Fb Ingestion Occurs Among A Relatively Small Number Of  Patients With Psychiatric Disorders And Is Costly. Endoscopic Retrieval Is  Relatively Effective And Safe, But Often Requires General Anesthesia. These Cases  Utilize Significant Hospital And Fiscal Resources. Attention Should Be Focused On  Preventing These Recurrent And Costly Episodes.

AB  - Most Cases Of Foreign-Body Aspiration Are Accidental Events In Children, Whereas The Majority Of Adults Will Have Neurological Dysfunction, Trauma, Alcohol Abuse,  Or Psychological Disorders. Much Has Been Written About Psychiatric Patients  Engaging In Self-Mutilation Such As Cutting And Burning, But Little Is Recorded  About Deliberate Aspiration Of Objects In These Patients, Who Clinically Can Be  Separated Into 4 Groups: (1) Malingering, (2) Psychosis, (3) Pica, And (4)  Personality Disorders. The Immediate Psychological Gain For These Patients Is  Unclear, As The Act Is Insidious With No Evidence Of Intentional Harm Or  Immediate Danger. Thus, They Are Considered As Being Parasuicidal Events Designed  To Diminish Other Psychological Processes. Aspirated Objects That Are Not  Immediately Dislodged By Coughing, Choking, Or Gagging Require Surgical  Intervention. Most Of These Patients Usually Come To The Attention Of A  Psychiatrist, But Such Intervention Does Not Prevent Recurrences. We Discuss A  Schizophrenic Patient Who Aspirated Multiple Coins While Under Psychiatric  Treatment For Prior Episodes Of Aspiration Of Coins, Ingestion Of Objects, And  Insertion Of Others In His Urethra And Rectum, While Also Reviewing Some Of The  Diagnostic And Therapeutic Challenges Inherent In The Management Of These  Patients.

JO  - Cochrane Database Of Systematic Reviews
AB  - Abstract - Background Nasal Pharyngolaryngoscopy (Npl) Is Performed As An Outpatient And Inpatient Procedure On A Daily Basis, For A Variety Of Indications. It Frequently Causes Some Degree Of Discomfort To The Patient. Various Different Topical Agents, Which Are Intended To Reduce This Discomfort, Are In Common Use. This Review Aimed To Assess The Effectiveness Of The Various Agents. Objectives To Assess The Effectiveness Of Topical Preparations Used To Reduce Discomfort And Facilitate Npl In Adults. Search Methods We Searched The Cochrane Ear, Nose And Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; The Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials (Central); Pubmed; Embase; Cinahl; Web Of Science; Biosis Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; Isrctn And Additional Sources For Published And Unpublished Trials. The Date Of The Most Recent Search Was 14 April 2010. Selection Criteria Randomised Controlled Trials (Rcts) Looking At The Effect Of Topical Anaesthetic Or Vasoconstrictor Agents Used Reduce Discomfort And Facilitate Npl In Adult Patients. Data Collection And Analysis Two Review Authors Independently Selected Studies, Extracted Data And Assessed Risk Of Bias. We Contacted Trial Authors For Further Information Where Necessary. The Primary Outcome Measured Was Pain/Discomfort. Secondary Outcomes That Were Looked At Included Side Effects Of The Topical Medications, Ease Of The Procedure And The Quality Of The View From The Operator'S Perspective. Main Results We Included Eight Rcts (746 Participants) In The Review. The Risk Of Bias In The Studies Was Generally Low. Five Studies Did Not Demonstrate Any Advantage In Using A Topical Treatment Prior To Endoscopy. One Study Suggested That A Vasoconstrictor Alone Should Be Used To Reduce The General Level Of Unpleasantness. Two Studies Did Not Compare Treatment Against Placebo Or No Treatment, So It Was Not Possible To Draw Meaningful Conclusions From Them. There May Be Some Unpleasant Side Effects From The Use Of Topical Preparations, Such As Unpleasant Taste. There Was Variation In The Format Of The Outcome Data And A Lack Of Complete Data; None Of The Included Studies Reported Their Results In A Way That Would Allow Pooling And We Could Not Therefore Perform Meta‐Analysis. Authors' Conclusions The Included Studies Do Not Demonstrate Any Evidence To Support The Use Of Topical Treatments Prior To The Use Of A Fibre‐Optic Nasal Endoscope. Some Go As Far As To Suggest That These Agents Should Not Be Used Due To Cost And Unpleasant Side Effects. Five Studies Did Not Demonstrate Any Advantage In Terms Of Reducing Pain Or Discomfort When Using A Topical Treatment Prior To Endoscopy. The Absence Of Demonstrable Effect May Be Due To Relatively Small Patient Groups. It Is Therefore Possible That There Is A Small Effect Of Using These Sprays. Further Research Using Standardised Reporting Methods Is Needed. Plain Language Summary Topical Anaesthetic Or Vasoconstrictor (Blood Vessel Narrowing) Preparations For Flexible Fibre‐Optic Nasal Pharyngoscopy And Laryngoscopy Topical Medications Are Often Applied To The Inside Of A Patient'S Nose Prior To Examining The Nose, Sinuses And Throat With A Flexible Nasopharyngolaryngoscope. The Aim Of This Is To Reduce Any Discomfort The Patient May Feel And Also To Improve The Adequacy Of The Examination. Types Of Preparation Include Lidocaine, Phenylephrine And Lidocaine, Oxymetazoline, Xylometazoline And Cocaine And They Are Usually Administered As A Spray, Although They May Also Be In The Form Of A Solution Which Can Be Applied To Cotton Wool And Placed In The Nasal Cavity, Or As Gels, Pastes Or Creams. We Looked For Randomised Controlled Trials Comparing Any Of These Topical Treatments With Placebo, No Treatment Or Another Topical Treatment In Adult Patients Undergoing Nasal Pharyngolaryngoscopy (Npl). We Included Eight Studies In The Review (With A Total Of 746 Patients). It Was Not Possible To Combine Data From Any Of The Studies, Therefore We Assessed The Individual Study Results. Five Of The Studies Did Not Demonstrate Any Advantage, In Terms Of Reducing Pain Or Discomfort, Of Using A Topical Treatment Prior To Endoscopy. One Of These Suggested That A Vasoconstrictor (Xylometazoline) Alone Reduced The Level Of "General Unpleasantness". Two Studies Did Not Compare The Treatment Against Placebo Or No Treatment. A Final Study Actually Suggested An Increase In Pain With The Use Of Topical Agents. There May Be Some Unpleasant Side Effects From The Use Of Topical Preparations, Such As Unpleasant Taste. Further Standardised Research Is Required.

Nevertheless, The  Literature On Dfbi Is Sparse, And Suggestions For Treatment Planning And  Management Are Limited. The Authors Sought To Investigate And Uncover Efficacious  Treatments And Strategies For Preventing Reoccurrence In Dfbi. We Build On  Earlier Work By Offering Both Broad And Diagnosis-Specific Management Strategies.  Method: A Literature Review Was Performed Addressing The Presentation, Management  And Prevention Of Reoccurrences Of Dfbi. Four Cases Of Dfbi Are Presented  Illustrating Those Psychiatric Diagnoses (Psychosis, Malingering,  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder And Borderline Personality Disorder) Most  Frequently Encountered In Hospital Practice. Both Broad And Specific Treatment  Approaches Are Presented. Results: Patients Engaging In Dfbi Are Best Managed  Through A Multidisciplinary Approach, Following Acute Medical Management.  Successful Strategies For The Prevention Of Reoccurrences Of Dfbi Are  Inconclusive. Conclusion: Understanding The Function Of This Behavior Is Critical  In Developing Treatment For Patients Who Engage In These Dangerous, Potentially  Life-Threatening, Self-Injurious Behaviors. An Amalgam Of Medical,  Pharmacological And Cognitive-Behavioral Interventions Is Recommended, As Is  Additional Research.

JO  - Pediatric Emergency Care
AB  - Objective: The Purpose Of This Study Was To Follow The Natural Course Of Spontaneous Passage (Sp) Of Ingested Foreign Bodies (Fbs) In Children. Methods:  The Medical Records Of 249 Patients Who Ingested Fbs Were Reviewed. In Addition,  They Were Studied By Telephone Questionnaires To Follow Up Spontaneously Passed  Fb. The Factors Associated With Sp Such As Age, The Type, Size, And Initial  Location Of The Fbs Were Analyzed. Results: Foreign Bodies Were Spontaneously  Passed In 145 Patients (58.2%), Endoscopic Removal Was Performed In 100 Patients  (40.2%), And Operative Removal Was Performed In 4 Patients (1.6%). Most Sp Fbs  Were Passed Within 5 Days. The Sp Rates (Sprs) According To The Initial Location  Were The Following: 12.2% For The Esophagus (P<0.0001), 71.4% For The Stomach,  85.7% For The Small Bowel, And 96.4% For The Colon. There Was No Significant  Difference In The Spr According To Age. When Coins And Disk Batteries That  Required Early Endoscopic Removal Were Excluded, The Spr Was 63.4% For Fbs Less  Than 10 Mm, 80.4% For Fbs 10 To 20 Mm, 72.8% For Fbs 20 To 30 Mm, And 50.0% For  Fbs More Than 30 Mm (P=0.091). The Initial Location Of The Fb (Odds Ratio, 33.7;  95% Confidence Interval, 14.4-79.0) And The Size Of The Fb (Odds Ratio, 3.5; 95%  Confidence Interval, 1.0-11.6) Were Independent Predictors Of Sp By Multivariate  Analysis. Conclusions: Most Fbs In The Gastrointestinal Tract Are Spontaneously  Passed Without Complication, And The Initial Location Of Fbs Was Found To Be The  Main Determining Factor For Spr. Ingested Fbs, In Children, Even Sharp Or  Relatively Large Fbs, Can Be Spontaneously Passed When They Are Located Below The  Esophagus.

JO  - International Journal Of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology
AB  - Objective: As Part Of The Oral Phase Of Development, Children Commonly Ingest Foreign Bodies. The Most Common Lodged Foreign Body, Requiring Operative Removal,  In The United States Is The Penny. Valued At 1 Cent, Comprised Of Materials  Valued At Less Than 1 Cent, Costing 1.62 Cents To Manufacture, And Being Never  Removed From Circulation, Pennies Are Aplenty. But Ingestion Can Lead To Mucosal  Damage, The Consequences Of Which Can Be Esophageal Perforation Or Stricture  Formation. We Hypothesize That The Monetary Value Of The Penny Is Far Less Than  The Cost Of Its Ingestion And Removal. This Quality Assurance Study Examines The  Effect Of The Penny On The Purse. Patients And Methods: This Retrospective Review  Identified 180 Foreign Bodies In Children Under The Age Of 18 Over A Five Year  Period. Eighty-Two Were Pennies. Operative Notes Revealed Degree Of Injury.  Hospital Charge Assessments Revealed The "Cost" Of Each Visit. Results: There  Were No Esophageal Perforations, And Cases Were Divided Evenly Among Injury  Grades 0-Iii. The Average Total Charge For All Penny-Related Injuries Was  $7164.78. Conclusions: The Purpose Was To Examine The Actual Cost Of A Penny  (More Than Its Value In Production) And The Potential Cost Of Its Damage  (Thousands Of Dollars In Measurable Costs, Untold Immeasurable Costs). The Goal  Of This Study Is To Draw Healthcare Professional And Public Attention To A  Potentially Serious And Yet Highly Preventable Injury In Young Children.

AB  - Purpose: A Foreign Body In The Rectum Is A Rare Clinical Entity. These Foreign Bodies Can Be Classified Under Two Major Groups: The Ones That Are Inserted From  The Anus And The Ones That Are Swallowed And Thereafter Become Stuck In The  Rectum. Methods: Data Of Patients Admitted With A Foreign Body In The Rectum  Between 1988 And 2008 Were Retrospectively Analyzed. A Total Of 30 Patients Were  Reviewed. Results: The Most Common Reason For A Foreign Body In The Rectum Was  Insertion For Erotic Purposes, Which Was Seen In 19 Of The 30 Patients. All These  Patients Were Male. The Remaining 11 Patients Reported Nonerotic Causes. The Most  Efficient And Implemented Therapeutic Method Was Simple Extraction During The  First Examination. Conclusions: The Most Common Reason For A Foreign Body In The  Rectum Is Insertion For Erotic Purposes. The First Target Of Therapy Should Be  Extraction Of The Foreign Body Using The Simplest Method Possible. Meanwhile,  Protecting The Integrity Of The Intestine Is Of The Utmost Importance. The Care  For Maintaining The Integrity Of The Rectum Should Include An Evaluation Of The  Patient'S Psychological Status.

JO  - Current Opinion In Pediatrics
AB  - Purpose Of Review: Evaluation Of The Child With Acute Abdominal Pain Is Challenging Because Of The Wide Range Of Potential Diagnoses. Presenting  Symptoms, Clinical Examination, And Laboratory Findings Can Guide Selection Of  Diagnostic Imaging. Recent Findings: Intussusception And Intestinal Malrotation  Are Potentially Serious Causes Of Intestinal Obstruction, Which Are Best  Evaluated By Ultrasound And Upper Gastrointestinal Series, Respectively.  Ultrasound Has Diagnostic Importance In The Evaluation Of Multiple Diseases,  Including Appendicitis, By Potentially Decreasing The Need For Inpatient  Observation, Cholecystitis And Complications Of Gall Stones Such As Pancreatitis,  And Ovarian Diseases. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Should Be Considered In  Evaluation Of A Teenage Girl With Lower Abdominal Pain. Less Common Causes Of  Acute Abdominal Pain Include Ingested Foreign Bodies, Infected Congenital  Anomalies, And Perforated Peptic Ulcer Disease. Summary: Presenting Symptoms And  Physical Examination Findings Can Narrow The Number Of Potential Diagnoses In  Pediatric Acute Abdominal Pain And Thereby Guide Diagnostic Imaging Selection.  Abdominal/Pelvic Ultrasound, Rather Than Computed Tomography Scan, Is The  Preferred Modality For Initial Evaluation Of Many Potential Causes Of Pediatric  Abdominal Pain.

JO  - Case Reports In Gastroenterology
AB  - The Majority Of Ingested Foreign Bodies Will Pass Safely Through The Gastrointestinal Tract, But Long And Rigid Foreign Bodies Are Associated With An  Increased Risk Of Gastrointestinal Impaction, Perforation And Bleeding. However,  Large Foreign Bodies Which Have Been Swallowed Can Remain Trapped In The Stomach  Over A Longer Period Of Time Without Any Significant Symptoms. This Case Report  Describes The Case Of A 36-Year-Old Man Addicted To Heroin Who Purposefully  Swallowed A Lighter (Double Wrapped In Cellophane) And Presented With Hematemesis  And Melena 17 Months After The Ingestion Of The Foreign Body. The Lighter Was  Successfully Removed Via Flexible Endoscopy Using A Polypectomy Snare. Swallowed  Long And Rigid Foreign Bodies Trapped In The Stomach Over A Long Period Of Time  Always Represent A Special Clinical And Endoscopic Challenge. In Cases Where  Endoscopic Removal Fails, A Laparoscopic Surgical Approach May Be An Alternative.

JO  - Case Reports In Gastroenterology
AB  - Intentional Ingestion Of Foreign Bodies Is Common In Psychiatric Patients And Prison Inmates. Timing Of Endoscopy For Ingested Foreign Bodies Varies And  Depends On The Type And Location Of The Foreign Body In The Gastrointestinal  Tract. We Present The Case Of A 26-Year-Old Man Who Was Brought From A  Correctional Facility After Confessing To Have Swallowed A Few Shower Curtain  Hooks. Abdominal X-Ray Done In The Emergency Room Revealed Multiple Foreign  Bodies In The Stomach. An Upper Endoscopy Was Done In The Emergency Room With The  Use Of An Overtube. The First Metal Piece Was Caught By A Snare And Removed With  The Endoscope. All Other Foreign Bodies Which Were Present On The Abdominal X-Ray  Could Not Be Visualized Initially As There Was Retained Food In The Stomach.  After Multiple Attempts, Four Other Foreign Bodies Were Found And Each One Was  Caught By The Forceps And Then The Scope Was Removed With The Forceps Holding The  Foreign Body. There Was An Additional Foreign Body In The Right Mainstem  Bronchus. The Patient Had Coughed Up The Foreign Body And Swallowed It Into The  Gastrointestinal Tract. A Computed Tomography Scan Of Chest And Abdomen Was Done  For Evaluation, Which Showed The Foreign Body In The Cecum. To Our Knowledge,  This Is The First Case Report Of A Patient Intentionally Transferring A Foreign  Body From One Organ System To Another. Colonoscopy Was Done And The Foreign Body  Was Removed Rectally With A Snare Without Any Complications.

AB  - The Ingestion Of Foreign Bodies Is A Rather Frequent Occurrence In Our Context; Ingestion May Be Accidental Or Deliberate. They Can Be Dangerous Because Of Their Location Or Nature, Making Endoscopic Extraction Urgent. The Aim Of Our Study Was To Evaluate, Using A Retrospective Study, The Success Rate Of Extraction Of Foreign Bodies In Our Context As Well As The Means Used. Over A Ten-Year Period (January 2001 To January 2011), All Patients Admitted To The Emergency Services Of Uhc Hassan-Ii, Fez, For The Ingestion Of Foreign Bodies Were Recorded. We Reviewed The Methods Used For Extraction And The Treatment Success Rate. During This Period, 82 Oesogastroduodenal Endoscopies (Ogde) Were Performed For The Extraction Of Foreign Bodies. There Was A Male Predominance (Sex Ratio: 1.5), With An Average Age Of 33.5 Years (6 To 83 Years); All Endoscopies Were Performed In An Emergency. Voluntary Ingestion Was Found In 24 Cases While 58 Cases Were Accidental. Among Foreign Bodies Frequently Encountered, There Were Needles In 17 Cases, Impaction Of A Piece Of Meat In 14 Cases, Ingestion Of Dentures In 11 Cases, While Other Objects (Coins, Razor Blades, Nails, Nail Cutters) Were Less Frequent. The Foreign Body Was Found In 32 Cases At A Gastric Level, An Oesophageal Level For 31 Patients, The Duodenum For Two Patients And No Foreign Body Was Found For 14 Patients. The Extraction Was Done Mainly By A Hot Wire Loop And Tripod Forceps Procedure; Extraction Was A Success In 43 Cases (52.4%), A Foreign Body Was Not Found In 17 Cases (20.7%), And The Extraction Failed In 13 Cases (16%). No Complication After Extraction Was Noted In Our Context.

AB  - Purpose: Pediatric Injuries Pose A Significant Health Burden In Sub-Saharan Africa, Though Historic Data Are Too Scarce To Appreciate The Extent Of The  Problem. The Purpose Of This Study Is To Utilize A Comprehensive Database To  Describe The Epidemiology Of Pediatric Injuries At A Tertiary Hospital In Malawi.  Methods: Data Were Prospectively Collected On Patients Presenting To The  Emergency Department For Treatment Of Injuries From 2008 To 2010 (N = 23,625).  The Subset Of Pediatric Patients (N = 7233) Underwent Cross-Sectional Analysis To  Examine Demographics, Injury Environment, Timing And Mechanisms. Results:  Pediatric Patients, (0-16 Years) Comprised 30.6% Of All Trauma Patients. Mean Age  Was 7.2 Years. Falls Were The Most Common Injury (43%), Followed By Burns  (11.1%), Pedestrian Road Traffic Injuries (9.7%), Foreign Bodies (7.5%), And  Assaults (7.2%). Statistically Significant Differences In Injury Pattern Were  Observed Between Gender, Age Groups And Season. After Logistic Regression,  Predictors Of Fall Included Male Gender, Home Setting, And Rainy Season, Whereas  Predictors Of Burn Included Female Gender, Age 0-5 Yrs, Home Setting, And Cold  Season. Predictors Of Pedestrian Injury Included Age 6-10 Yrs, Female, And  Roadside Setting. Predictors Of Foreign Body Ingestion Included Age 0-5 Yrs,  Female Gender, Home Setting, And Daytime, And Predictors Of Assault Include Male  Gender, Age 11-16 Yrs, Nighttime Hours. All Predictors Were Statistically  Significant (P < 0.05). Conclusions: This Study Revealed Patterns Of Injury Based  Upon Age, Gender, Location, And Season. Our Results May Prove Useful To  Stakeholders In Injury Prevention For Designing, Evaluating, And Implementing  Programs To Improve Public Safety In Children In Malawi And Similar Resource Poor  Nations.

AB  - Background: The General Guidelines On The Management Of Ingested Foreign Bodies (Fbs) Do Not Address Specific Aspects Raised By Psychiatric Patients,  Particularly In Patients With Borderline Personality Disorders (Bpd) Who  Repeatedly Ingest Fbs. The Aim Of This Survey Was To Collect Data On Experience  And Opinions On The Management Of Fbs In Psychiatric Patients With Bpd And To  Review The Relevant Literature. Methods: A Survey Focusing On The Indication And  The Timing Of Endoscopy For Sharp Fb Removal In Patients With Bpd Was E-Mailed To  215 Gastroenterologists, Psychiatrists, And Surgeons In Switzerland, Germany And  Austria, Discussing This Clinical Problem Using A Specific Case Vignette.  Results: Responses Were Received From 63 Of 215 (29%) Contacted Physicians.  Two-Thirds Of The Respondents Knew Patients With Bpd Who Had Swallowed Fbs  Repeatedly; 86% Recommended Removing Sharp Fbs Endoscopically Even In The Case Of  Repeated Fb Ingestion And 14% Of Respondents Argued Against Emergent Endoscopic  Fb Removal In The Case Of Repeated Ingestions. Different Specialities Expressed  Partially Divergent Opinions Regarding The Management Of These Patients.  Conclusion: Repeated Fb Ingestions Can Be A Problem In Patients With Bpd.  Although Published Data Show That The Perforation Risk Of Unremoved Fbs Is Low,  Most Clinicians Support Repeated Endoscopies Also In The Case Of Repeated Fb  Ingestions. Nevertheless, In Selected Cases, Repeated Endoscopies Need To Be  Discussed And An Interdisciplinary Consensus And/Or The Involvement Of An Ethical  Committee Is Advised.

AB  - Suicide Is One Of The Leading Causes Of Death In Multiple Age Groups. Therefore, It Is Important That Radiologists Be Aware Of This Commonly Encountered Entity. Attempted Suicide May Take A Variety Of Forms; Those Discussed By The Authors Include Sharp Force Injury, Immolation And Inhalation, Ingestion, Hanging, Firearm Use, Jumping From A Height, And Drowning. Certain Radiologic Findings Are Commonly Seen In Cases Of Attempted Suicide And Other Self-Injurious Behaviors. In Some Cases, Especially When The Patient Is Unconscious Or Is Unwilling To Provide A History, It May Not Be Apparent That Suicide Has Been Attempted Until Characteristic Imaging Findings Are Recognized. Correct Identification Of Suicide Attempts On The Basis Of Such Findings Will Ensure That These Patients Receive Appropriate Psychiatric Treatment. When A Suicide Attempt Is Unsuccessful, It Is Important To Be Familiar With The Complications That May Contribute To Delayed Mortality And Morbidity. The Radiologist Plays An Integral Role In The Acute Medical Or Surgical Management Of Patients Who Have Attempted Suicide. In Addition, Imaging Examinations May Provide Useful Forensic Information.

AB  - Objective: The Demand And Usage Of Button Batteries Have Risen. They Are Frequently Inadvertently Placed By Children In Their Ears Or Noses And  Occasionally Are Swallowed And Lodged Along The Upper Aerodigestive Tract. The  Purpose Of This Work Is To Study The Different Presentations Of Button Battery  Foreign Bodies And Present Our Experience In The Diagnosis And Management Of This  Hazardous Problem In Children. Patients And Methods: This Study Included 13  Patients. The Diagnostic Protocol Was Comprised Of A Thorough History, Head And  Neck Physical Examination, And Appropriate Radiographic Evaluation. The Button  Batteries Were Emergently Extracted Under General Anesthesia. Results: The  Average Follow-Up Period Was 4.3 Months. Five Patients Had A Nasal Button  Battery. Four Patients Had An Esophageal Button Battery. Three Patients Had A  Button Battery In The Stomach. One Patient Had A Button Battery Impacted In The  Left External Ear Canal. Apart From A Nasal Septal Perforation And A Tympanic  Membrane Perforation, No Major Complications Were Detected. Conclusion: Early  Detection Is The Key In The Management Of Button Battery Foreign Bodies. They  Have A Distinctive Appearance On Radiography, And Its Prompt Removal Is  Mandatory, Especially For Batteries Lodged In The Esophagus. Physicians Must  Recognize The Hazardous Potential And Serious Implications Of Such An Accident.  There Is A Need For More Public Education About This Serious Problem.

AB  - Repeated Self-Harm Usually Presents With Associated Psychopathology, Mostly In The Form Of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Malingering, Or Personality Disorders,  And May Persist For Many Years. This Case Presentation Focuses On Self-Harm  Involving The Deliberate Ingestion Of Foreign Bodies. This Behavior Remains  Poorly Understood, And The Relevant Literature Focuses Almost Entirely On  Gastroenterological And Surgical Management, With Little Or No Discussion Of  Underlying Psychological Mechanisms, Psychopathology, Or Psychotherapeutic  Intervention. The Goal Of This Article Is To Begin To Fill That Gap By Presenting  The Case Of A Young Woman Who Was Diagnosed With Borderline Personality Disorder  And Followed For 20 Years, Who Repeatedly Swallowed Objects As A Form Of  Self-Harming Behavior. The Nosological Status And Possible Functions Of This  Behavior Are Discussed, As Are The Difficulties Of Caring For Patients With Such  Long-Standing, Repeated Selfinjury. This Case Illustrates How The Boundaries  Between Different Self-Injurious Behaviors Are Blurred And Also How Different  Self-Injurious Behaviors Are Likely To Share Common Patterns, Functional  Integrity, And Meanings. It Should Also Serve To Remind Us How Far We Have To Go  In Terms Of Understanding, Classifying, And Successfully Treating Certain  Patients Who Present With Longterm And Bizarre Self-Injurious Behavior.

AB  - Objective: The Purpose Of This Study Was To Validate The Usefulness Of Mdct For Diagnosis Of A Sharp Or Pointed Esophageal Foreign Body According To Esophageal  Level. Materials And Methods: Forty-Two Patients With A History Of Sharp Or  Pointed Foreign Body Ingestion Were Reviewed Retrospectively. Two Observers  Interpreted The Ct And The Conventional Radiography Datasets Separately. If A  Foreign Body Was Directly Identified, It Was Regarded As A Positive Finding. Even  If No High-Density Foreign Body Was Found, Detection Of A Secondary Finding Was  Considered To Be A Positive Finding. Diagnostic Performance Of Mdct And  Conventional Radiography Were Compared According To Esophageal Level. Final  Diagnosis Was Made By Esophagoscopy Or Surgery In Addition To The  Clinicoradiologic Result. Results: Mdct Was Statistically Superior To  Conventional Radiography For Diagnosis Of A Thoracic Esophageal Foreign Body For  Both Observers (P < 0.001 For Each). No Significant Difference In Sensitivity  Between Ct And Conventional Radiography For Diagnosis Of Cervical Esophageal  Foreign Body Was Noted Regardless Of Observer. Both Observers Could Identify All  Complicated Conditions With Mdct Regardless Of Esophageal Level. However, In Two  Of Three Cases Of Complicated Thoracic Esophageal Foreign Bodies, Neither  Observer Could Detect Foreign Bodies On Conventional Radiography; Furthermore,  The Observers Could Not Identify Pneumomediastinum. Conclusion: In Cases Of Sharp  Or Pointed Foreign Body Ingestion, If The Result Of An Initial Inspection Of Oro-  And Hypopharynx Reveals Negative Findings, The First Imaging Modality Should Be  Mdct For Better Diagnosis And Management.

AB  - Background: Intentional Ingestion Of Foreign Objects (Iifo) Is Common In The Incarcerated Population. This Study Was Undertaken In Order To Better Define  Clinical Patterns Of Iifo Among Prisoners. We Sought To Determine Factors  Associated With The Need For Endoscopic And Surgical Therapy For Iifo. Methods:  After Obtaining Permission To Conduct Iifo Research In Incarcerated Populations,  Study Patients Were Identified By Icd-9 Codes. Patient Charts Were Reviewed For  Demographics; Past Medical History; Iifo Characteristics; And Diagnostic,  Endoscopic, And Surgical Findings. Univariate And Multivariate Analyses Were  Performed Using Statistical Software. Results: Thirty Patients With 141 Episodes  Of Iifo Were Identified. The Mean Number Of Ingested Items Per Episode Was 4.60.  Endoscopy Was Performed In 97 Of 141 Iifo Instances, With Failure To Retrieve The  Ingested Object In 21 Of 97 Cases (22%). Eleven Instances (7.8%) Required  Surgical Intervention. On Multivariate Analyses, Hospital Admission Was  Associated With Elevated White Blood Cell Count (Odds Ratio [Or] 1.4, P < 0.05)  And Number Of Items Ingested (Or 1.3, P < 0.05). The Need For Endoscopy Was  Independently Associated With Ingestion Of Multiple Objects (Or 3.3, P < 0.05)  And Elevated White Blood Cell Count (Or 1.3, P < 0.05). Surgical Therapy Was  Significantly Associated With Elevated White Blood Cell Count (Or 1.6, P < 0.01)  And With Increasing Number Of Ingested Items (Or 1.07 Per Item, P < 0.05).  Endoscopy Is Associated With Significantly Lower Odds Of Surgery (Or 0.13,  P < 0.01). Conclusions: Intentional Ingestion Of Foreign Objects Continues To  Pose A Significant Human And Economic Burden. The Need For Admission Or Therapy  Is Frequently Associated With Leukocytosis. Further Investigation Is Warranted  Into Resource-Appropriate Triage Of Patients Who Present With Iifo.

AB  - Purpose: The Incidence Of Button Battery Ingestions Is Increasing And Injury Due To Esophageal Impaction Begins Within Minutes Of Exposure. We Changed Our  Management Algorithm For Suspected Button Battery Ingestions With Intent To  Reduce Time To Evaluation And Operative Removal. Methods: A Retrospective Study  Was Performed To Identify And Evaluate Time To Treatment And Outcome For All  Esophageal Button Battery Ingestions Presenting To A Major Children'S Hospital  Emergency Room From February 1, 2010 Through February 1, 2012. During The First  Year, Standard Emergency Room Triage (St) Was Used. During The Second Year, The  Triage Protocol Was Changed And Trauma I Triage (Tt) Was Used. Results: 24  Children Had Suspected Button Battery Ingestions With 11 Having Esophageal  Impaction. One Esophageal Impaction Was Due To 2 Stacked Coins. Time From Arrival  In Emergency Room To Battery Removal Was 183Minutes In St Group (N=4) And  33Minutes In Tt Group (N=7) (P=0.04). One Patient In St Developed A  Tracheoesophageal Fistula. There Were No Complications In The Tt Group.  Conclusions: The Use Of Trauma 1 Activations For Suspected Button Battery  Ingestions Has Led To More Expedient Evaluation And Shortened Time To Removal Of  Impacted Esophageal Batteries.

AB  - Purpose: The Aim Was To Evaluate The Efficacy Of Endoscopy-Assisted Surgery For Treating A Foreign Body (Fish Bone) Deeply Embedded In The Parotid Duct. Patients And Methods: We Report The Case Of A 67-Year-Old Man With Diffuse Swelling Of The Cheek And The Discharge Of Pus From The Parotid Duct Orifice Caused By A Fish Bone That Had Penetrated Into The Parotid Duct. The Preoperative Examination Using Ultrasonography And Computed Tomography Showed A Linear Foreign Body. Results: The Fish Bone Was Thought To Be Embedded Deeply In The Parotid Duct; Therefore, We Used A Combined Approach (Endoscopy With Open Surgery), Because We Anticipated Difficulties With Endoscopic Removal Of The Fish Bone. The Endoscopic View Showed That The Fish Bone Had Partially Penetrated The Soft Tissue In The Parotid Duct Wall, But The Fish Bone Could Not Be Removed Endoscopically. With Endoscopic Assistance, The Impacted Fish Bone Was Removed Using An Intraoral Surgical Approach. The Clinical Outcome Was Satisfactory During A 10-Month Follow-Up Period, With No Evidence Of Complications. Conclusions: The Combined Surgical And Endoscopic Approach Resulted In The Safe And Effective Removal Of A Foreign Body From The Salivary Duct That Could Not Be Removed Using Sialendoscopy Alone.

AB  - Foreign Body Ingestion Is A Common Clinical Scenario Among Patients Of All Ages. The Immediate Risk To The Patient Ranges From Negligible To Life Threatening.  Initial And Follow-Up Management Strategies Depend On Multiple Patient And  Ingested Object-Related Factors. Available Literature On This Topic Tends To  Focus On The Small Child Or Adult, Leaving The Clinician Caring For Adolescents  To Extrapolate This Information To Guide Decision Making For Individual Patients.  This Article Reviews Foreign Body Ingestion Literature With Important  Implications To The Adolescent Patient And Raises Awareness Of Some Highly  Dangerous Objects Such As Large Button Batteries, High-Powered Magnets, Long  Sharps, Narcotic Packages, And Super Absorbent Objects. An Additional Focus  Includes The Management Of Esophageal Food Impaction. We Highlight The Unique  Aspects To The Care Of The Adolescent With Intentional Ingestion And Co-Morbid  Psychiatric Illness. The Article Concludes By Discussing The Challenges To  Prevention Of Ingestion In The At-Risk Patient.

AB  - Purpose: Foreign Body (Fb) Ingestion Is A Common And Potentially Serious Problem In Children. Both Rigid (Re) And Flexible (Fe) Endoscopic Techniques Are Used For  Removal Of Esophageal Fbs; However, There Is No Consensus Amongst Pediatric  Surgeons Regarding The Best Method. This Study Reviewed Our Experience Managing  Esophageal Fbs Using Both Techniques. Methods: A 12-Year Retrospective Review Of  Children Admitted With An Esophageal Fb Between 1999 And 2012 Was Undertaken.  Clinical Data, Management Techniques, And Complications Were Abstracted.  Differences Between These Two Groups Were Compared With Standard Statistical  Methods. Results: 657 Children Were Treated For Esophageal Fb Ingestion, Of Which  366 (56%) Were Treated With Fe. The Most Frequently Ingested Item Was A Coin  (84%), And Fbs Were Most Commonly Lodged In The Upper Third Of The Esophagus  (78%). There Was A Slightly Younger Population In The Fe Group (4.0 Vs. 3.3  Years, P < 0.01), But Otherwise No Significant Differences Were Found Between The  Groups. The Fb Was Successfully Removed With The Initially Chosen Technique In  97% Of Patients. Conclusions: Esophageal Fbs May Be Successfully Removed With  Either Re Or Fe. Since Treatment Failures Were Managed With Conversion To The  Other Technique, Both Procedures Should Be Included In The Training Curriculum.

Methods: After Internal Review Board Approval, The Charts Of Pediatric  Patients (0-18Years Old) Who Had Undergone Slide Tracheoplasty For  Tracheoesophageal Fistula Were Retrospectively Reviewed. Patient Information And  Surgical Outcomes Were Reviewed. Results: Nine Patients Underwent Slide  Tracheoplasty For Correction Of Te Fistula. In Five Patients The Original Te  Fistula Was Congenital. Other Causes Included Battery Ingestion, Tracheostomy  Tube Complications, Foreign Body Erosion, And An Iatrogenic Injury. The Average  Age At Repair Was 48±64 Months (Range: 1-190). Seven Patients Had Undergone  Previous Tef Repair Either Open Or Endoscopically. There Were No Recurrences  After Repair. Two Patients Had Sternal Periosteum Interposed Between The  Esophagus And Trachea. There Were No Tef Recurrences. A Single Patient Had  Dehiscence Of The Tracheal Anastomosis And Underwent A Second Procedure.  Conclusion: Slide Tracheoplasty Is An Effective Method To Treat Complex Te  Fistulas. The Procedure Was Not Associated With Any Recurrences. This Is The  First Description Of A Novel, Effective, And Safe Method To Treat Te Fistulas.

Purpose: To Investigate The Efficacy Of 64-Slice  Multidetector Computed Tomography (Mdct) For The Evaluation Of Pharynx And Upper  Esophageal Fb Foreign Bodies. Material And Methods: Sixty-Six Patients With  Suspected Fb Foreign Body Ingestion Were Examined By Plain Radiography (N = 40)  And Unenhanced Mdct (N = 66). We Analyzed The Presence, Location, Size, Shape,  And Lying Position Of The Foreign Bodies. Results: On Mdct, 46 Foreign Bodies  Were Detected. Among Them, 45 Were Confirmed By Endoscopy. The Sensitivity Of  Mdct For The Detection Of Foreign Bodies Was 100%, Which Was Superior To That Of  The Plain Radiography (51.7%). The Location Of The Foreign Bodies Was Most Common  In The Upper Esophagus (N = 22, 47.8%), Followed By Pharyngoesophageal Junction  (N = 10, 21.7%), Transjunctional (N = 7, 15.2%), Hypopharynx (N = 5, 10.9%), And  Oropharynx (N = 2, 4.3%). Their Longest Length Was 5.3-40.1 Mm (Mean, 21.3 Mm).  Thirty-Three Fbs (71.7%) Were Linear And 13 (28.3%) Were Flat In Shape. They  Showed Transverse (N = 23, 50.0%), Parallel (N = 13, 28.3%), And Oblique  Positions (N = 10, 21.7%) To The Long Axis Of The Pharynx And Esophagus,  Respectively. Conclusion: Mdct Is Useful For The Evaluation Of The Pharynx And  Upper Esophageal Fb Foreign Bodies.

AB  - Introduction: The Ingestion Of Foreign Bodies Is A Frequently Observed Problem In Daily Clinical Practice. In Order To Avoid Complications Such As Perforation,  Endoscopic Removal Of Potentially Penetrating Foreign Bodies Should Be Attempted  Quickly. The Use Of Various Endoscopic Techniques Has Been Reported For This  Purpose. However, Extraction Of Foreign Bodies From The Mid Gastrointestinal  Tract Has Rarely Been Reported. Case Report: We Present The Case Of A Patient Who  Had Swallowed A Safety Needle Which Could Safely Be Removed From The Jejunum By  Means Of Double-Balloon Enteroscopy (Dbe). The Combination Of A Thin P-Type  Enteroscope With A Thick T-Type Overtube Was Used In Order To Improve The  Manoeuvrability Of The Endoscope. The Needle Was Pulled Into The Overtube Which  Served As A Protective Shield During The Retrieval Of The Endoscope. Conclusion:  Our Case Report Describes The Potential Of Removing Foreign Bodies From The Deep  Small Bowel By Pulling Them Into The Overtube Of A Double-Balloon Enteroscope. If  The Suspicion Of Foreign Body Impaction In The Small Bowel Is Made, It May Be  Advisable To Primarily Choose A Balloon Enteroscopy System. Through This, Quick  And Deep Insertion Can Be Combined With A Safe Removal Of The Foreign Body.

AB  - Foreign Body Impaction In The Upper Digestive Tract Is Not An Infrequent Emergency In Every Clinical Setup. In The Present Retrospective Study, We Have Tried To Analyze The Incidence Of Impacted Foreign Body In The Upper Digestive Tract At Our Center. The Most Frequent Presentation Is History Of Foreign Body Ingestion Or Aspiration. They Are Chiefly Produced By Accidental Swallowing Of The Foreign Body In The Extremes Of Age And Deliberate Attempts In Case Of Psychiatric And Criminal Background Subjects. Varied Manifestations Of Dysphagia, Drooling Of Saliva And Retro-Sternal Pain Is Presented. Additional Symptoms Of Vomiting And Subjective Sensation Of Breathlessness Are Present Occasionally. Removal Of Foreign Body At Times Is A Challenge For The Gastrointestinal Endoscopist. If Not Intervened Expeditiously, Can Lead To Horrific Outcome. In Our Review Study, Rigid Endoscopy Resolved The Problem In Majority Of Cases By Removal Of The Foreign Body Or Dislodgement Of The Impacted Fleshy Meat Ball In To The Stomach. We Report A Retrospective Study Of Incident And Types Of Impacted Foreign Body In The Upper Digestive Tract. The Study Was Carried Out At A Tertiary Care Center At Gangtok, India, Spread Over 5 Years. The Review Of The Case Details Was Tabulated And The Incidence Types And Outcome Was Calculated To Review The Clinical Condition And Its Management.

AB  - This Is A Case Series With Chart Review Of 59 Consecutive Pediatric Patients With A Diagnosis Of Cervical Esophageal Coin Who Underwent Anterior-Commissure  Laryngoscope (Acla) Extraction During Apnea. The Purpose Of This Study Was (1) To  Evaluate The Efficacy And Safety Of Coin Extraction And (2) To Analyze Foreign  Body Features And Intraoperative Physiological Parameters (Apnea Time, O2  Saturation And End-Tidal Co2 (Etco2) Of Apnea, Minimum O2 During Procedure, And  Heart Rate). The Technique Was Completed In 94.9% Of The Sample. The Mean Of The  Length Of Apnea Was 57.7 ± 25.2 Seconds. The Median Minimum O2 Saturation Was  99.5% (Minimum = 93, Maximum = 100), And The Median Of The Etco2 At The End Of  The Procedure Was 35.7 ± 4.8 Mm Hg. Heart Rates Remained At Baseline Values  During The Procedure (P < .001). This Technique Represents An Efficient And  Secure Modality For Treatment. If Successful, The Patient Can Be Safely  Discharged After Clearance From Anesthesia And A Swallowing Trial.

AB  - Introduction: Recurrent And Intentional Ingestion Of Metallic Objects Is A Rare But Important Phenomenon. It Has Attracted Great Interest Among Mental Health  Professionals Over The Last Decades. However, This Issue Is Rarely Reported In  The Literature. A Deep Exploration Of Its Clinical And Specific  Psychopathological Aspects Remains Limited. Case Report: We Report The Case Of A  32-Year-Old Female Patient, Who Was Sentenced To 20 Years In Prison For Homicide  Against Her Cousin, The Daughter Of An Uncle Who Had Raped Her When She Was 14.  This Affair Was Hushed By The Patient'S Family And The Patient Was Submitted To  Several Acts Of Abuse By Her Family. Following Her Incarceration, She Repeatedly  Ingested Metallic Objects Requiring Repeated Admissions In A Department Of  Surgery For Endoscopic Extractions Or Surgical Interventions. She Impulsively  Ingested More Than 30 Times Various Metallic Objects Such As Wire, Razor Blades,  Spoons, Etc., Under The Pressure Of Impulsiveness And Massive Anxiety. Voluntary  Metal Ingestions, Associated With Iterative Self-Mutilation Behaviors, Took Place  Within The Framework Of A Borderline Personality Disorder, The Incarceration And  The Conditions Of Imprisonment Playing A Role In Initiating And Retaining The  Behavior. Conclusion: Through This Case Report, We Examine The Specific  Psychiatric Aspects Of Intentional Ingestion Of Metallic Objects In Order To  Better Understand This Behavior.

AB  - Aim: To Investigate Predictive Risk Factors Associated With Complications In The Endoscopic Removal Of Foreign Bodies From The Upper Gastrointestinal Tract.  Methods: We Retrospectively Reviewed The Medical Records Of 194 Patients With A  Diagnosis Of Foreign Body Impaction In The Upper Gastrointestinal Tract,  Confirmed By Endoscopy, At Two University Hospital In South Korea. Patient  Demographic Data, Including Age, Gender, Intention To Ingestion, Symptoms At  Admission, And Comorbidities, Were Collected. Clinical Features Of The Foreign  Bodies, Such As Type, Size, Sharpness Of Edges, Number, And Location, Were  Analyzed. Endoscopic Data Those Were Analyzed Included Duration Of Foreign Body  Impaction, Duration Of Endoscopic Performance, Endoscopic Device, Days Of  Hospitalization, Complication Rate, 30-D Mortality Rate, And The Number Of  Operations Related To Foreign Body Removal. Results: The Types Of Upper  Gastrointestinal Foreign Bodies Included Fish Bones, Drugs, Shells, Meat, Metal,  And Animal Bones. The Locations Of Impacted Foreign Bodies Were The Upper  Esophagus (57.2%), Mid Esophagus (28.4%), Stomach (10.8%), And Lower Esophagus  (3.6%). The Median Size Of The Foreign Bodies Was 26.2 ± 16.7 Mm. Among 194  Patients, Endoscopic Removal Was Achieved In 189, And Complications Developed In  51 Patients (26.9%). Significant Complications Associated With Foreign Body  Impaction And Removal Included Deep Lacerations With Minor Bleeding (N = 31,  16%), Ulcer (N = 11, 5.7%), Perforation (N = 3, 1.5%), And Abscess (N = 1, 0.5%).  Four Patients Underwent Operations Because Of Incomplete Endoscopic Foreign Body  Extraction. In Multivariate Analyses, Risk Factors For Endoscopic Complications  And Failure Were Sharpness (Hr = 2.48, 95%Ci: 1.07-5.72; P = 0.034) And A Greater  Than 12-H Duration Of Impaction (Hr = 2.42, 95%Ci: 1.12-5.25, P = 0.025).  Conclusion: In Cases Of Longer Than 12 H Since Foreign Body Ingestion Or  Sharp-Pointed Objects, Rapid Endoscopic Intervention Should Be Provided In  Patients With Ingested Foreign Bodies.

AB  - Objective. The Purpose Of This Article Was To Evaluate The Usefulness Of Ultralow-Dose Chest Ct As An Initial Imaging Study For Evaluation Of Sharp Fish Bone Esophageal Foreign Body (Fb). Materials And Methods. A Total Of 57 Subjects Who Underwent Ultralow-Dose Chest Ct Were Included In This Retrospective Study. All Subjects Had A History Of Ingestion And Symptoms Of Esophageal Fb. All Ultralow-Dose Chest Ct Data Were Reconstructed Twice, Once With Filtered Back Projection (Fbp) And Once With Iterative Reconstruction, And Three Observers Reviewed The Images Independently. Roc Analysis Was Used To Evaluate Diagnostic Performance Of Ultralow-Dose Chest Ct. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (Icc) Was Calculated For Analysis Of Interobserver Agreement. Results. Among 57 Patients, 42 Were Confirmed As Having Esophageal Fb. Significant Objective Noise Reduction Of Mediastinum Was Achieved Using An Iterative Reconstruction Technique. Subjective Image Noise Of Iterative Reconstruction Was Significantly Better Than That Of Fbp. Overall Diagnostic Performance Of Ultralow-Dose Chest Ct For Esophageal Fb Of Iterative Reconstruction (Auc = 0.999) Was Significantly Better Than That Of Fbp (Auc = 0.95) (P = 0.02). Interobserver Agreement Was Greater For Iterative Reconstruction (Icc = 0.944) Than For Fbp (Icc = 0.778). Conclusion. Ultralow-Dose Chest Ct Using Iterative Reconstruction Provided Satisfactory Diagnostic Image Quality For Identifying Fish Bone Esophageal Fb With Reduced Radiation Dose And High Observer Accuracy. Therefore, Ultralow-Dose Chest Ct Would Be Adequate As A First-Line Imaging Modality For Fish Bone Esophageal Fb.

AB  - The Intentional Ingestion Of Foreign Objects (Iifo) Is Described More Commonly In Prison Populations Than In The General Population, With An Estimated Annual  Incidence Of 1 In 1900 Inmates In Our State Correctional Facilities. Incidents  Often Involve Ingestion Of Small Metal Objects (E.G., Paperclips, Razor Blades)  Or Other Commonly Available Items Like Pens Or Eating Utensils. Despite Ingestion  Of Relatively Sharp Objects, Most Episodes Can Be Clinically Managed With Either  Observation Or Endoscopy. Surgery Should Be Reserved For Those With Signs Or  Symptoms Of Gastrointestinal Perforation Or Obstruction. For Those With A History  Of Iifo, Efforts Should Focus On Prevention Of Recurrence As Subsequent Episodes  Are Associated With Higher Morbidity, Significant Healthcare And Security Costs.  The Pattern Of Iifo Is Often Repetitive, With Escalation Both In Frequency Of  Ingestions And In Number Of Items Ingested. Little Is Known About Successful  Prevention Strategies, But Efforts To Monitor Patients And Provide Psychiatric  Care Are Potential Best-Practice Strategies. This Article Aims To Provide  State-Of-The Art Review On The Topic, Followed By A Set Of Basic Recommendations.

AB  - Gastrointestinal Foreign Bodies (Fb) Are Comprised Of Food Bolus Impaction And Intentionally Or Unintentionally Ingested Or Inserted True Fb. Food Bolus  Impaction And True Fb Ingestion Represent A Recurrent Problem And A True  Challenge In Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. More Than 80-90% Of The Ingested True Fb  Will Pass Spontaneously Through The Gastrointestinal Tract Without Complications.  However, In 10-20% Of The Cases An Endoscopic Intervention Is Deemed Necessary.  True Fb Ingestion Has Its Greatest Incidence In Children, Psychiatric Patients  And Prisoners. On The Other Hand, Food Bolus Impaction Typically Occurs In The  Elderly Population With An Underlying Esophageal Pathology. The Most Serious  Situations, With Higher Rates Of Complications, Are Associated With Prolonged  Esophageal Impaction, Ingestion Of Sharp And Long Objects, Button Batteries And  Magnets. Physicians Should Recognize Early Alarm Symptoms, Such As Complete  Dysphagia, Distressed Patients Not Able To Manage Secretions, Or Clinical Signs  Of Perforation. Although Many Papers Are Yearly Published Regarding This Subject,  Our Knowledge Is Mainly Based On Case-Reports And Retrospective Series. Herein,  The Authors Summarize The Existing Evidence And Propose An Algorithm For The Best  Approach To Fb Ingestion.

JO  - Case Reports In Surgery
AB  - Introduction. Unintentional Foreign Body Ingestion Commonly Occurs Accidentally In Children Aged Between 3 Months And 6 Years And At Advanced Ages Or Results From Psychiatric Disorders Such As Hallucination In Patients With Mental Retardation. Most Of The Ingested Foreign Bodies Are Naturally Discharged From The Body But Some Of Them May Require Surgical Intervention. Presentation Of Case. A 29-Year-Old Mentally Retarded Female Patient Was Admitted To The Emergency Service With A Two-Day History Of Abdominal Pain, Nausea, And Vomiting. Physical Examination Revealed Abdominal Tenderness, Defense, And Rebound On Palpation. Radiological Examination Revealed Diffuse Air-Fluid Levels And A Radiopaque Impression Of A Metal Object In The Right Upper Quadrant. The Metal Teaspoon Causing Ileal Perforation Was Extracted By Emergency Laparotomy. On Postoperative Day 7, The Patient Was Uneventfully Discharged Following A Psychiatric Consultation. Discussion. Foreign Body Ingestion Can Occur Intentionally In Children At Developing Ages And Old-Age Patients, Or Adults And Prisoners, Whereas It May Occur Unintentionally In Patients With Mental Retardation Due To Hallucination. However, Repeated Foreign Body Ingestion Is Very Rare In Individuals Other Than Mentally Retarded Patients. Conclusion. Mentally Retarded Patients Should Be Kept Under Close Surveillance By Surgeons And Psychiatrists Due To Their Tendency To Ingest Foreign Bodies.

The Purpose Of This Study Is To Retrospectively Review A Surgical  "Double Patch" Technique In Treating Nonmalignant Complicated Tef And Bgsf, And  Then Clarify The Long-Term Curative Effect Of The Technique. Methods: Clinical  Records Of 30 Patients With Non-Malignant Complicated Tef And Bgsf Treated By  "Double Patch" Technique In Tangdu Hospital Between August 2004 And August 2014,  Were Analyzed And Summarized Retrospectively. Results: Thirty Patients (19 Males  And 11 Females) Underwent "Double Patch" Surgical Repair Of Acquired Benign  Complicated Tef And Bgsf. The Median Age Of The Patients Was 40.2±21.1 Years. The  Most Common Causes Were The Following: Tef [22], Bgsf [8]. Post-Intubation Injury  [6], Trauma [5], Foreign Body And Stents [10], Complications From Prior  Esophageal Surgery [8], And Caustic Ingestion [1]. The Follow-Up Was Completed  For 24 Months In All The Patients (100%). The Operative Mortality Was 0% (0/30).  Twenty-Six Patients (86.7%) Recovered Uneventfully While Four Patients (13.3%)  Exhibited Some Major Complications In The Perioperative And Postoperative  Periods. One Patient (3.3%) Developed Recurrence Of Tracheal Fistula In Situ, Two  Patients (6.7%) Showed Pneumonia, And One Patient (3.3%) Developed Fistula  Esophageal Anastomosis. All The 30 Patients Resumed Oral Intake Finally.  Conclusions: The Double Patch Technique Is An Effective And Safe Method To Repair  The Acquired Non-Malignant Complicated Tef And Bgsf.

JO  - Journal Of The Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan Yi Zhi
AB  - Background/Purpose: Despite The Effectiveness Of Endoscopies In Removing Ingested Foreign Bodies (Fbs) Impacted In The Esophagus, The Merits And Limitations Of  Flexible Endoscopy (Fe) And Rigid Endoscopy (Re) Remain Unclear. Therefore, This  Study Compares The Advantages And Disadvantages Of Both Endoscopic Procedures  From A Clinical Perspective. Methods: A Retrospective Review Was Made Of 273  Patients Suspected Of Esophageal Fbs In Emergency Consultations Of A Tertiary  Medical Referral Center From March 2010 To March 2014. All Patients Received  Routine Physical Examinations, Otolaryngological Examinations, And X-Rays Of The  Neck And Chest. The Door-To-Endoscopy Time, Procedure Time, Postendoscopic  Hospital Stay, Successful Removal Rates, And Complications Were Analyzed As Well.  Results: In This Study, The Most Common Esophageal Fbs Were Fish And Animal Bones  (76%) In Adults And Coins (74%) In Children. The Patients With Existing  Esophageal Fbs Had Significantly More Frequent Symptoms Of Dysphagia And Signs Of  Linear Opacity As Detected With Lateral Neck Radiography Than Those Without Fb.  Additionally, The Door-To-Endoscopy Time, Procedure Time, And Postendoscopic  Hospital Stay Was Significantly Shorter In Fe Patients Than In Re Patients.  However, Both Re And Fe Patients Had High Rates Of Successful Fb Removal (95%)  And Low Complication Rates (2%). Conclusion: Both Fe And Re Remove Esophageal Fbs  Successfully, As Evidenced By Their High Success Rates, Low Complication Rates,  And High Detection Rates. Although Fe Under Local Anesthesia Is A Less  Time-Consuming Procedure For Adults, Re Under General Anesthesia May Be  Preferable For Children And Can Serve As An Alternative To Fe.

AB  - Introduction: Intentional Ingestions Of Foreign Objects (Iifo) Continue To Be Prevalent Among Prisoners. Our Previous Research Examined Determinants Of Hospital Admission, Endoscopy, And Surgery Among Prisoners Who Ingest Foreign Objects. However, Little Is Known About The Financial Impact Of These Events On Healthcare Facilities That Service The Prisoner Population. This Study Aims To Fill This Gap By Examining Hospital Charges Attributable To 435 Prisoner Episodes Of Iifo. Methods: A Retrospective Review Of All Prisoners Who Presented To Our Medical Center With The Complaint Of Iifo Was Conducted. Both Institutional Review Board And Bureau Of Prisons Approvals Were Obtained Before Data Collection. All Prisoners Ages 18-75 Were Included Between The Dates Of January 2004 And December 2011. Episodes Were Divided Into Three Categories: (A) Unverified Iifo Wherein Ingested Object Was Claimed By The Patient But Never Identified; (B) Verified Iifo Wherein Ingested Object Was Clearly Identified; (C) Secondary Events Due To Direct Complications Of Previous Iifo Episode (S). The Temporal Occurrence Of Iifo Was Organized By Increasing The Number Of Episodes And Grouped Accordingly. Detailed List Of Hospital Charges Was Obtained For Every Iifo Episode Including: (A) Emergency Services, (B) Procedures, (C) Laboratory, (D) Surgical Supplies, (E) Allied Health Services, (F) Radiology Studies, (G) Anesthesiology Charges, (H) Pharmacy, And (H) Intensive Care Costs. Descriptive Statistics Were Used To Analyze Basic Data. Kruskal-Wallis Test Was Used To Examine Differences Among Nonnormally Distributed Variables And Sub-Groups. Statistical Significance Set At Alpha = 0.05. Results: A Total Of 435 Iifo Episodes Occurred During The Study Period In A Population Of 125 Patients (Mean Age 33.8 +/- 11.7 Years, Median Age 34 [Range 19-75] Years, 92.8% Male). Hospital Charges Associated With These Episodes Totaled $6,209,557. There Were 94 Unverified Iifos, 332 Verified Iifos, And 9 Secondary Events. Verified Iifos Were Associated With Significantly Greater Median Charges ($5,860) Than Unverified Iifos ($3,997) And Secondary Events Carried Lower Cost ($3,501) Than The Former Two (P < 0.01). We Also Observed A Pattern Of Escalating Costs Associated With Increasing Number Of Sequential Iifo Episodes, With The 1St Episode Carrying Median Charges Of $4,683 And Episodes Numbered 11+ Carrying Median Charges Of $7,698 (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Hospital Charges Associated With The Care Of Prisoners Who Ingest Foreign Objects Tend To Escalate Over Time. Although Charges In Most Of The Categories Demonstrated Increases With Greater Numbers Of Ingestions, The Largest Contributors To This Pattern Of Escalating Charges Included Radiology, Pharmacy, Hospital Room Charges, And Surgical Services. These Findings Suggest That Early Intervention In The Destructive Cycle Of Iifo May Not Only Improve Patient Outcomes But Also Result In Savings To The Healthcare System. The Following Core Competencies Are Addressed In This Article: Medical Knowledge, Patient Care, Practice Based Learning And Improvement, Systems Based Practice.

AB  - Purpose: Foreign Body (Fb) Ingestion Is Common In Children, And Button Battery (Bb) Ingestion Has Been Increasing In Recent Years. This Study Was To Identify  Factors Related To Outcomes Of Fb Ingestion, Particularly Bbs In The Stomach. We  Evaluated Whether The Current Recommendations Are Appropriate And Aimed To  Suggest Indications For Endoscopic Removal Of Bb In The Stomach In Young  Children. Methods: We Investigated Patient Age, Shape, Size, Location Of Fbs,  Spontaneous Passage Time And Resulting Complications Among 76 Children. We  Observed Types, Size, Location Of Bb And Outcomes, And Analyzed Their  Associations With Complications. Results: Coins And Bb Were The Two Most Common  Fbs. Their Shapes And Sizes Were Not Associated With The Spontaneous Passage  Time. Size, Spontaneous Passage Time, And Age Were Also Not Associated With Any  Specific Complications. For Bb Ingestion, All 5 Cases With Lithium Batteries  (≥1.5 Cm, 3 V) Presented Moderate To Major Complications In The Esophagus And  Stomach Without Any Symptoms, Even When The Batteries Were In The Stomach And  Beyond The Duodenum, While No Complications Were Noted In 7 Cases With Alkaline  Batteries (<1.5 Cm, 1.5 V) (P=0.001). All Endoscopies Were Conducted Within 24  Hours After Ingestion. Conclusion: The Type And Voltage Of The Battery Should Be  Considered When Determining Whether Endoscopy Is Required To Remove A Bb In The  Stomach. For Lithium Battery Ingestion In Young Children, Urgent Endoscopic  Removal Might Be Important In Order To Prevent Complications, Even If The Child  Is Asymptomatic And The Battery Is Smaller Than 2 Cm.

AB  - Purpose: The Management And Clinical Course In Pediatric Patients Who Had Ingested Foreign Body Were Investigated Retrospectively To Evaluate The Frequency  And Factor Associated With Successful Removal Of Fishbone Foreign Body. Methods:  Based On The Medical Records Of Patients Younger Than 15 Years Old Who Visited  Emergency Room Because Of Foreign Body Ingestion From January 1999 To December  2012, The Authors Reviewed Clinical Characteristics Including Type Of Ingested  Foreign Bodies, Time To Visits, Managements And Complications. Results: Fishbone  (50.1%) Was The Most Common Ingested Foreign Body In Children. Among 416 Patients  With Ingested Fishbone, 245 (58.9%) Were Identified And Removed Using  Laryngoscope, Rigid Or Flexible Endoscope From Pharynx Or Upper Esophagus By  Otolaryngologists And Pediatric Gastroenterologists. The Kind Of Ingested Fish  Bone In Children Was Diverse. The Mean Age Of Identified And Removed Fishbone  Group Was 7.39 Years Old, And Higher Than That Of Unidentified Fishbone Group  (5.81 Years Old, P<0.001). Identified And Removed Fishbone Group Had Shorter Time  Until Hospital Visit Than The Unidentified Fishbone Group (2.03 Vs. 6.47 Hours,  P<0.001). No Complication Due To Ingested Fishbone Or Procedure Occurred.  Conclusion: Older Age And Shorter Time From Accident To Hospital Visit Were The  Different Factors Between Success And Failure On Removal Of Ingested Fish Bone In  Children.

AB  - The Majority Of Gastrointestinal (Gi) Foreign Bodies (Fbs) Discovered In Adults Are The Result Of Intentional Ingestion, Most Of Which Are Found In Patients With  A Preexisting Psychiatric Illness, With Substance Abuse Disorders, Or In People  Seeking Secondary Gain. No Similar Case Of Internal Injuries Following  Unintentional Ingestion Of A Barbecue Grill Cleaning Brush Bristle Has Been  Reported. A 58-Year-Old Caucasian Male With No Significant History Presented With  Complaint Of Halitosis, Not Improving After Oral Care And Dental Hygiene  Measures. He Denied Any Other Symptoms. After Ruling Out Oral Causes Of  Halitosis, An Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Was Performed, Which Revealed A Black  Wire-Shaped Metallic Fb Embedded In The Duodenum. The Fb Was Identified As A  Silver Metallic Flexible Wire Resembling The Bristle Of A Barbecue Grill Cleaning  Brush. The Halitosis Resolved Completely Within 3 Weeks Of The Removal Of The Fb.  To The Best Of Our Knowledge, This Is The First Case Of Duodenal Impaction Of A  Barbecue Grill Cleaning Brush Bristle Atypically Presenting With Halitosis.  Physicians' Awareness Of This Potential Injury From Grill Cleaning Brush Bristles  Would Lead To A Quick Diagnosis After A Focused History. Also Avid Grillers Must  Be Made Aware Of This Potential Hazard And Should Be Encouraged To Carefully  Examine The Barbecue Grill Surface For Any Remnant Bristle Of The Grill Cleaning  Brush. Appropriate History Taking, Considering Gi Causes As Potentially Inducing  Halitosis, And An Awareness Of This Entity Among Providers Are Important To  Facilitate Prompt Diagnoses And Prevent Major Adverse Outcomes.

T1  - Sealing Procedures For Preterm Prelabour Rupture Of Membranes
Y1  - 2016
AU  - Crowley, Ae

JO  - Cochrane Database Of Systematic Reviews
AB  - Abstract - Background Preterm Prelabour Rupture Of The Membranes (Pprom) Complicates Approximately 2% Of Pregnancies And Can Be Either Spontaneous Or Iatrogenic In Nature. Complications Of Pprom Include Prematurity, Chorioamnionitis, Neonatal Sepsis, Limb Position Defects, Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Pulmonary Hypoplasia Chronic Lung Disease, Periventricular Leukomalacia And Intraventricular Haemorrhage. A Number Of Different Sealing Techniques Have Been Employed Which Aim To Restore A Physical Barrier Against Infection And Encourage The Re‐Accumulation Of Amniotic Fluid. Routine Use Of Sealants Is Currently Not Recommended Due To A Lack Of Sufficient Evidence To Support The Safety And Effectiveness Of Such Interventions. Objectives To Assess The Effects Of Sealing Techniques Following Pprom Against Each Other, Or Versus Standard Care (Including No Sealant), On Maternal And Neonatal Outcomes. Search Methods We Searched The Cochrane Pregnancy And Childbirth Group’S Trials Register (30 May 2016) And Reference Lists Of Retrieved Studies. Selection Criteria Randomised And Quasi‐Randomised Controlled Trials Comparing Different Techniques For Sealing Preterm Prelabour Ruptured Membranes. Cluster‐Randomised Trials And Trials Using A Cross‐Over Design Were Not Eligible For Inclusion In This Review. We Planned To Include Abstracts When Sufficient Information Was Provided. Data Collection And Analysis Two Review Authors Independently Assessed Trials For Inclusion And Assessed Trial Quality. Two Review Authors Independently Extracted Data. Data Were Checked For Accuracy. Main Results We Included Two Studies (Involving 141 Women ‐ With Data From 124 Women). We Considered Both Studies As Being At High Risk Of Bias. Meta‐Analysis Was Not Possible Because The Included Studies Examined Different Interventions (Both In Comparison With Standard Care) And Reported On Few, But Different, Outcomes. One Study Compared Cervical Adapter (Mechanical Sealing), And The Other Study Examined An Immunological Membrane Sealant. Neither Of The Included Studies Reported On This Review'S Primary Outcome Of Interest ‐ Perinatal Mortality. Similarly, Data Were Not Reported For The Majority Of This Review'S Secondary Infant And Maternal Outcomes. Cervical Adapter (Mechanical Sealing) Versus Standard Care (One Study, Data From 35 Participants) No Data Were Reported For This Review'S Primary Outcome ‐  Perinatal Mortality . Data Were Reported For Few Of This Review'S Infant Or Maternal Secondary Outcomes. There Was No Clear Difference Between The Mechanical Sealing Group And The Standard Care Control In Relation To The Incidence Of  Neonatal Sepsis  (Risk Ratio (Rr) 1.19, 95% Confidence Interval (Ci) 0.28 To 5.09 ( Very Low‐Quality Evidence )) Or  Chorioamnionitis  (Rr 1.19, 95% Ci 0.28 To 5.09 ( Very Low‐Quality Evidence )). Oral Immunological Membrane Sealant Versus Standard Care (One Study, Data From 94 Participants) No Data Were Available For  Perinatal Mortality  (This Review'S Primary Outcome) Or For The Majority Of This Review'S Infant And Maternal Secondary Outcomes. Compared To Standard Care, The Immunological Membrane Sealant Was Associated With A Reduction In  Preterm Birth Less Than 37 Weeks  (Rr 0.48, 95% Ci 0.34 To 0.68 ( Very Low‐Quality Evidence )) And A Reduction In  Neonatal Death  (Rr 0.38, 95% Ci 0.19 To 0.75 ( Very Low‐Quality Evidence) ). However, There Was No Clear Difference Between Groups In Terms Of  Neonatal Sepsis  (Rr 0.64, 95% Ci 0.28 To 1.46 ( Very Low‐Quality Evidence )) Or  Respiratory Distress Syndrome  (Rr 0.64, 95% Ci 0.28 To 1.46 ( Very Low‐Quality Evidence )). Authors' Conclusions There Is Insufficient Evidence To Evaluate Sealing Procedures For Pprom. There Were No Data Relating To This Review'S Primary Outcome (Perinatal Mortality) And The Majority Of Our Infant And Maternal Secondary Outcomes Were Not Reported In The Two Included Studies. There Was Limited Evidence To Suggest That An Immunological Membrane Sealant Was Associated With A Reduction In Preterm Birth At Less Than 37 Weeks And Neonatal Death, But These Results Should Be Interpreted With Caution As This Is Based On One Small Study, With A High Risk Of Bias, And The Intervention Has Not Been Tested In Other Studies. Although Midtrimester Pprom Is Not A Rare Occurrence, There Are Only A Small Amount Of Published Data Addressing The Benefits And Risks Of Sealing Procedures. Most Of These Studies Are Retrospective And Cohort Based And Could Therefore Not Be Included In Our Data‐Analysis. This Review Highlights The Paucity Of Prospective Randomised Trials In This Area. Current Evidence Provides Limited Information Both On Effectiveness And Safety For The Interventions Described. Given The Paucity Of High‐Quality Data, We Recommend That Future Research Efforts Focus On The Conduct Of Randomised Trials Assessing The Effect Of Promising Interventions That Have Been Only Evaluated To Date In Cohort Studies (E.G. Amniopatch). Future Trials Should Address Outcomes Including Perinatal Mortality, Preterm Birth, Neonatal Death, Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Neonatal Sepsis And Developmental Delay. They Should Also Evaluate Maternal Outcomes Including Sepsis, Mode Of Delivery, Length Of Hospital Stay And Emotional Well‐Being. Plain Language Summary Treatments For Improving Outcomes For Mother And Baby When The Waters Have Broken Too Early What Is The Issue? Preterm Prelabour Rupture Of The Membranes (Pprom) Is When The Waters Break At Less Than 37 Weeks' Gestation. It Occurs In One In 50 Pregnancies And Can Happen Spontaneously Or After A Medical Procedure Has Been Performed, For Example, Tests Where A Needle Is Placed In To The Womb To Get A Sample Of Fluid Or Tissue, Or After An Operation Has Been Performed On The Baby Inside The Womb. Why Is This Important? Breaking Of The Waters Early In Pregnancy Can Lead To Significant Problems Including The Baby Being Born Too Soon To Survive, Having Immature Lungs, And Serious Infections. Preterm Babies Are Overall More Likely To Be Ill And To Suffer From Long‐Term Disabilities, If They Do Survive. The Survival Of Babies Affected By Pprom Is Related To How Early It Occurs In The Pregnancy And If An Infection Occurs. In Some Circumstances, The Waters May Reseal Themselves. This Is More Likely To Occur When No Infection Is Present. Several Treatments To Reseal The Membranes Have Been Tried, With Varying Success. Resealing Has Been Attempted By: A) Injecting Clotting Factors And Other Medicines In To The Hole In The Womb To Create A Patch Over The Area That Is Leaking; B) Taking Tablets That May Stimulate The Body’S Immune System To Mend The Area Where The Seal Has Broken; C) Placing A Sponge Over The Hole In The Waters; D) Placing A Seal Over The Neck Of The Womb To Stop Fluid Leaking Out And Prevent Infection. Our Study Is Important Because Finding A Successful Treatment For Pprom May Reduce The Potential Complications That May Happen To The Mother And Baby Such As Preterm Birth (Being Born Before 37 Weeks' Gestation) And Infections. What Did We Find? In Our Study We Assessed The Different Techniques Used For Resealing The Waters. We Aimed To Compare The Survival Of Babies Affected With This Condition Before And After Birth And Look At The Rates Of Complications In Both The Babies And Mothers. We Searched For Trials (30 May 2016) And Found Two Studies That Compared Treatments For Resealing The Membranes After They Had Broken. These Trials Involved 141 Women In Total And Compared Two Completely Different Modes Of Treatment. One Trial Compared The Use Of An Oral Immunological Membrane Sealant To Stimulate The Body’S Immune System To Mend The Area Where The Seal Has Broken And The Other Trial Placed A Mechanical Sealing Device Over The Cervix (Neck Of The Womb) To Stop Fluid Leaking. Unfortunately, Neither Trial Provided Any Data Relating To Death Of The Baby Within The Womb Or In The First 28 Days Of Life (Perinatal Mortality). There Was Limited Evidence To Suggest That Oral Immunological Membrane Sealant Was Associated With A Fewer Babies Being Before 37 Weeks’ Gestation And A Reduction In The Number Of Babies That Died Within The First 28 Days. However, These Results Are Based On  Very Low‐Quality Evidence  From One Small Trial (With Data From 94 Women) That We Judged To Be At A High Risk Of Bias. There Was No Clear Difference Between The Mechanical Sealing Device Group And The Control Group In Relation To The Number Of Babies Who Contracted A Serious Infection (Neonatal Sepsis) Or Chorioamnionitis (A Bacterial Infection That Causes Inflammation Of The Membranes Surrounding The Baby In The Womb). Although These Results Are Based On  Very Low‐Quality Evidence  From One Small Trial (Involving 35 Women) Judged To Be At A High Risk Of Bias. What Does This Mean? Overall, Our Question Remains Unanswered ‐ We Do Not Have Enough Data To Fully Evaluate Sealing Procedures For Pprom. This Review Demonstrates The Lack Of Research In This Area Regarding The Effectiveness And Safety Of Potential Treatments For Pprom. We Recommend That More Research Is Needed To Look At The Different Techniques For Sealing Broken Waters And That This Research Should Focus On The Effectiveness Of The Treatment In Improving Overall Outcomes. The Safety Of The Treatments To Both Mother And Baby Must Be Further Evaluated Before Sealing Techniques Can Be Recommended To Prevent Adverse Outcomes.

AB  - Self-Harm Is A Much More Common Pathology Within The Prison Environment Than Outside Of This, So Much So That It Can Be Considered Specific To It. For 7 Years, In The Biggest Prison Hospital In Romania, Self-Harm Was Present In 5% Of The Hospitalized Patients, With A Total Of 762 Cases. The Mechanisms Of Self-Harm Were The Ingestion Of Foreign Bodies (63%) And The Insertion Of Foreign Bodies In: The Soft Parts (19%), Intracranially (6%), Intraabdominally (2%) And Intrathoracically (2%). Metal Bodies Are The Most Commonly Used In Self-Harm (Over 90%). The Self-Harm Technique Is Learnt From The Inmates With A History Of Such Incidents. The Mortality Is Low (0.4%), Refusal Of Treatment Is Found In 13% Of Cases, And Recurrence Of Self-Harm Is Common Where The Ingestion And Intracranial Insertion Of Foreign Bodies Occurs (42%-50%). Mental Disorders, Dominated By Personality Disorders, Are Found In 46% Of Patients.

AB  - Objectives: The Purpose Of This Study Was To Investigate The Epidemiology Of Wire-Bristle Grill Brush Injury. Study Design And Setting: Cross-Sectional  Analysis Of National Databases; Literature Review. Subjects And Methods: The  Consumer Product Safety Commission'S National Electronic Injury Surveillance  System (Neiss) Was Used To Derive A National Weighted Estimate Of Emergency  Department Visits For Wire Bristle Injury From 2002 To 2014. Date, Location Of  Injury, Demographics, And Outcomes Were Analyzed. A Literature Search And A  Consumer-Reported Injury Database (Saferproducts.Gov) Were Interrogated To  Provide Ancillary Sources Of Data. Results: A Total Of 43 Cases Were Found Within  The Neiss Database, Which Extrapolated To An Estimated 1698 (95% Confidence  Interval, 1468-1927) Emergency Department Visits Nationwide. In The Neiss  Database, The Mean Age Was 30 Years, And The Sex Distribution Of The Patients Was  Similar (21 Males Vs 22 Females). The Most Common Location Of Injury Was The  Oropharynx In Both The Neiss Database (23 Of 43, 53.4%) And The Literature Review  (11 Of 36, 30.5%). However, The Oral Cavity Was The Most Frequent Site In The  Consumer-Reported Saferproducts.Gov Database (9 Of 24, 37.5%). The Majority Of  Patients In The Neiss Were Treated In The Emergency Department (31 Of 43, 69.7%).  Raw Case Counts Were Highest In June, July, And August, With The Highest Number  Of Events In The Month Of July. Conclusion: Injury From Wire-Bristle Grill Brush  Is Uncommon But Prevalent During Certain Seasons. Otolaryngologists Play An  Important In The Diagnosis And Treatment Of These Injuries. Awareness Among  Consumers And Product Manufacturers Is Necessary To Promote Safety.

The Purpose Of This Study Was To Present Cases Of Patients With Esophageal Button Battery Ingestion Treated At Our Clinic And To Emphasize The Importance Of Early Diagnosis And Treatment. Methods: Records Of Patients Admitted To Our Hospital For Foreign Body Ingestion Between January 2010 And May 2015 Were Retrospectively Reviewed. Cases With Button Battery Lodged In The Esophagus Were Included In The Study. Patient Data Regarding Age, Sex, Length Of Time After Ingestion Until Admission, Presenting Clinical Symptoms, Type And Localization Of The Battery, Management, And Prognosis Were Analyzed. Results: Among 1891 Foreign Body Ingestions, 71 Were Localized In The Esophagus, And 8 Of Those (11.2%) Were Cases Of Button Battery Ingestion. Mean Age Was 1.7 Years. Admission Was Within 6 Hours Of Ingestion In 5 Cases, After 24 Hours Had Elapsed In 2, And 1 Month After Ingestion In I Case. All Patients But I Knew The History Of Ingestion. Prompt Endoscopic Removal Was Performed For All Patients. Three Patients Developed Esophageal Stricture, Which Responded To Dilatation. Conclusion: Early Recognition And Timely Endoscopic Removal Is Mandatory In Esophageal Button Battery Ingestion. It Should Be Suspected In The Differential Diagnosis Of Patients With Persistent Respiratory And Gastrointestinal Symptoms.

AB  - Background: Inedible Substance Ingestion Increases The Risk Of Ileus, Poisoning, And Suffocation. Prevention Is Especially Important In A Psychiatric Setting. This Study Aimed To Analyze The Incidence Of Inedible Substance Ingestion In A Japanese Psychiatric Hospital. Methods: Inedible Substance Ingestion Incidents Were Extracted From An Incident Report Database Spanning 2000–2012 At A 400‐Bed Psychiatric Hospital In Japan. We Tabulated The Frequencies Of Incidents In Accordance With Major Diagnosis, Ingested Materials, Incident Levels, And Time Of Occurrence. Results: The Incidence Rate Was 0.09/1000 Patient Days, And 149 Cases In 105 Patients Were Classified As Having Experienced Inedible Substance Ingestion. The Most Common Diagnosis Was Dementia (N = 58), Followed By Schizophrenia (N = 22). Materials Ingested By Dementia Patients Were Nappies Or Gauze Attached To The Patient'S Body After Medical Procedures. Materials Ingested By Schizophrenic Patients Were Liquid Soap, Detergent Or Shampoo, And Cigarettes. Inedible Substance Ingestion Among Dementia Patients Occurred Mostly Before Or During Meals. Among Schizophrenic Patients, The Peak Period Of Incidents Was In The Evening. Conclusions: Dementia Patients Were Overrepresented In The Inedible Substance Ingestion Incidents. Items They Wore Or Applied To Their Bodies Were Often Subject To Ingestion, And Such Behaviours Mostly Occurred Around Meal Time. Therefore, The Nursing Staff Were Able To Discover Them Quickly And Treat Most Of The Cases Free Of Serious Consequences. In Contrast, Schizophrenic Patients Were Underrepresented In The Incidents, And Most Cases Involved Ingestion Of Detergent Powder Or Cigarettes, Resulting In More Serious Consequences And Requiring Treatment.

AU  - Funakoshi, Hiraku
JO  - International Journal Of Emergency Medicine
AB  - Background: Coins Are Made Of Metal, Which Is Generally Radiopaque, And So Physicians Often Have The Misconception That All Coins Are Detectable By  Radiography. Here, We Report A Case Of Intentionally Swallowed Coins In The  Oesophagus Of An Adult; The Coins Could Not Be Detected On Chest Radiography But  Were Detected Using Computed Tomography (Ct). Case Presentation: A 46-Year-Old  Woman With A History Of Depression Presented To The Emergency Department After An  Intentional Medication Overdose And Ingestion Of Two Japanese 1-Yen Coins. She  Complained Of Persistent Retrosternal Discomfort. In Order To Confirm Whether The  Coins Were In The Oesophagus Or Trachea, An Anteroposterior Chest Radiograph Was  Obtained; However, No Coins Were Detected. Owing To Her Persistent Symptoms, A  Chest Ct Was Performed. On The Initial Ct Scan, Two 1-Yen Coins Were Observed In  The Oesophagus: One In The Middle Oesophagus And The Other In The Lower  Oesophagus. After The Scanning, The Patient Drank Water With Permission, But  Vomited. No Coins Were Found In Her Vomit, And The Symptoms Of Retrosternal  Discomfort Had Completely Disappeared. A Subsequent Ct Scan Revealed That The Two  1-Yen Coins Were In The Patient'S Stomach. Conclusions: Japanese 1-Yen Coins Are  Made Of 100% Aluminium, Which Is Less Radiopaque Than The Metals That Make Up  Coins (Nickel, Bronze, And Lead), And So, They Were Not Visible Via Chest  Radiography In Our Case. Detecting Very Small Or Thin Radiolucent Foreign Bodies  Is Not Possible Using A Chest Radiograph Or Contrast Oesophagram, But Is Possible  Via Ct. Ct Is Both Increasingly Convenient And Non-Invasive, Unlike Endoscopy Or  Bronchoscopy, And So, The Use Of Ct Scans Should Be Considered In Cases Of  Possible Radiolucent Foreign Body Ingestion.

AB  - The Purpose Of This Study Is To Compare The Clinicopathological Characteristics And Outcomes Of Esophageal Foreign Body (Fb) Ingestion In Adults Between Weekdays And Holidays. This Is A Retrospective Study Including 1058 Patients With Esophageal Fb Ingestion From 2012 To 2016. Patient Characteristics, The Types And Locations Of Fb, And Clinical Outcomes Were Compared Between Patients On Weekdays And Holidays. Furthermore, Independent Risk Factors Of Complication On Weekdays And Holidays Respectively Were Evaluated. The Locations Of Fb, Underlying Diseases, And Complications Significantly Differed Between Weekdays And Holidays Groups, While No Difference Was Found In The Types Of Fb. Patients Got Higher Percentage Of Erosion Complication On Holidays Than That On Weekdays (60.8% Vs 47.6%, P<.0001). Multivariate Logistic Regression Analysis Revealed That Jujube Shell Was A Significant Predictor Of Complication On Weekdays (P<.001). However, Complication Was Significantly Associated With Nonfood Bolus Fb Ingestion On Holidays (P<.001). Our Data Suggest That There Were Different Clinicopathological Characteristics Of Fb Ingestion Between Weekdays And Holidays, And More Patients Got Complications On Holidays. On Holidays, A Latex Protector Hood Or An Overtube Should Be Applied To Patients Who Swallowed Nonfood Bolus In Order To Reduce Esophageal Mucosal Damage.

AB  - Purpose: To Explore The Experiences Of Children With Dysphagia And/Or Feeding Difficulties Post-Chemical Or Button Battery Ingestion Injury From The  Perspective Of The Primary Caregiver. Method: Five Primary Caregivers Of Children  With A History Of Dysphagia And/Or Feeding Difficulties Post-Ingestion Injury (4  Chemical, 1 Button Battery) Completed The Children'S Picky Eating Questionnaire  (Cpeq), And Participated In A Semi-Structured Interview. Interviews Explored  Experiences Of Caring For A Child With Dysphagia And/Or Feeding Difficulties,  Impressions Of Services And Supports, And Additional Impacts To The Child And  Family. Content Analysis Was Used To Identify Key Themes. Result: Primary  Caregiver Report And Cpeq Results Confirmed All Children Had Some Degree Of  Persisting Dysphagia And/Or Feeding Difficulties At Time Of Interview (Mean 4.13  Years' Post-Injury). Interviews Identified Five Key Themes: 1) The Initial Trauma  Of The Injury, 2) The Experience Of Associated And Ongoing Medical Issues, 3)  Managing Altered Oral Intake, 4) Experiences Of Services And Support, And 5)  Impacts On The Child, Primary Caregiver, And Wider Family Unit. All Caregivers  Reported Significant Challenges And Concerns, And Potential Areas Of Service  Improvement Were Highlighted. Conclusion: The Current Data Highlights Specific  Issues Experienced By Primary Caregivers, And Poses Areas For Improving Primary  Caregiver And Family Supports. Family-Centered Models Of Care Are Needed To  Support The Whole Family Unit In Caring For A Child With Dysphagia And/Or Feeding  Difficulties Post-Ingestion Injury.

AB  - Introduction: Intentional Ingestion Of Foreign Objects (Iifo) Is Prevalent Among U.S. Prisoners. Iifos Often Require Surgical Or Endoscopic Interventions, Extended Hospital Stays, And May Result In Significant Morbidity Or Even Mortality. Although Psychiatric Illness Is Prevalent Among Prisoners Engaging In Iifo, This Association Remains Poorly Defined. The Aim Of This Study Is To Describe The Psychiatric Illness Profile Among Prisoners Diagnosed With Iifo. We Hypothesized That Repeated Episodes Of Iifo Are Associated With An Escalating Pattern Of Documented Psychiatric Illness. Methods: After Approvals Were Obtained From Our Institutional Review Board And The Ohio Department Of Rehabilitation And Correction, A Retrospective Study Was Conducted Of Prisoners Presenting To Our Facility With Iifo Between 2004 And 2011. All Historical And Concurrent Psychiatric Diagnoses Were Abstracted From The Medical Record And Classified Into Diagnostic And Statistical Manual Of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition Based Categories. In Addition, Medical History, Alcohol/Drug Use, And Prior Episodes Of Iifo Were Recorded. Statistical Analyses Included Chi-Square And Kruskal-Wallis Tests For Categorical And Continuous Data, Respectively. Results: We Analyzed 136 Iifo Episodes Involving 27 Patients. Repeat Iifo Episodes Were Associated With An Increasing Number Of Psychiatric Diagnoses. Patients With Their Fifth Or Later Iifo Had A Larger Number Of Psychiatric Diagnoses And The Number Of Objects Ingested As Compared To Patients Presenting With A First Episode (P < 0.01). Similarly, Patients Who Went On To Present With Additional Episodes Of Iifo During The Study Had More Psychiatric Diagnoses Identified Throughout Their Visits (P < 0.01). The Proportion Of Patients With Mood And Anxiety Disorders (Including Post-Traumatic Stress) Was Progressively Greater Among Prisoners With Recurrent Episodes Of Iifo (P < 0.05). Other Psychiatric Disorders Were Not Significantly Associated With Iifo Escalation. Conclusions: We Observed A Significant Association Between Iifo Recurrences And Increases In Both The Quantity Of Ingested Items And The Number Of Documented Psychiatric Diagnoses. Of Note, Psychiatric Diagnoses Of Malingering Or Secondary Gain Were Not Identified In The Current Patient Sample. Consideration Of Early Psychiatric Evaluation And Intervention In The Setting Of Iifo, Especially Recurrent Iifo, Is Strongly Encouraged. The Following Core Competencies Are Addressed In This Article: Medical Knowledge, Patient Care, Systems-Based Practice.

AB  - Foreign Body (Fb) Ingestion, Which Can Be Accidental Or Intentional, Is Quite Common, Especially In Children, Elderly And Some Categories Of Profession. On The Other Hand, Perforation And Abscess Formation As Complications Of Fb Ingestion Are Rare. Their Presentation Is Not Clinically Different From Other Causes Of Peritonitis And Differential Diagnosis Is Sometimes Difficult. The Most Common Cause Of Fb Perforation Is Due To Fish Bone Ingestion. We Present Two Consecutive Cases Of Complications Associated To Fish Bone Ingestion. In The First Case, Patient Had Diffused Abdominal Pain, Without Laboratory Considerable Signs Of Inflammation. Computer Tomography (Ct) Scan Evidenced Ileal Perforation Due To A Probable Fb; In The Second Case Patient Presented Abdominal Pain, Leukocytosis And Elevated Crp. The Ct Scan Revealed Presence Of Abscess And Omental Inflammation Near Ileum. Both Patients Submitted Surgery. In The First Case, An Enterotomy Was Done, In The Second Case Omentectomy And Abdominal Cleaning Were Performed. Surprisingly, In The Second Case, The Patient Claimed For Damages In The High Suspicion For A Medical Error Occurred In A Previous Operation. Fortunately, The Specimen Exam Revealed The Truth. Complications Due To Fbs Ingestion Must Be Adequately Recognized And Rapidly Treated. Radiological Tools, Especially Ultrasonography And Ct Scan, Can Be Useful To Make Diagnosis But Sometimes This Is Reached Only At The Time Of Intervention.

AB  - Background: Perforation Is The Most Serious Complication Of Esophageal Foreign Bodies. Studies Examining The Association Between Diabetes And Esophageal Foreign Body-Induced Perforation Are Largely Non-Existent. Objectives: The Purpose Of This Study Was To Identify The Risk Factors For Esophageal Foreign Body-Induced Perforation. Methods: A Retrospective Chart Review Of Patients With Esophageal Foreign Bodies Between January 2012-January 2017 Was Performed At The Chinese People'S Liberation Army General Hospital. The Patients Were Divided Into Two Groups: Those Complicated With Perforation And Those Without Perforation. Date On Patient Demographics, Symptoms, Foreign Bodies, And Diabetes Were Collected And Analyzed. Study-Specific Odds Ratio And 95% Confidence Intervals (Ci) Were Estimated Using Multivariable Logistic Regression Models. Results: Of 294 Patients With Esophageal Foreign Bodies (41.84% Male, Mean Age, 56.73 Years), 33 (11.22%) Complicated By Perforation. Diabetes (Odds Ratio = 6.00; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.72-20.23), Duration (> 24 H) Of Foreign Bodies Retention (Odds Ratio = 4.25; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.71-10.86), And Preoperative Fever (Odds Ratio = 8.19; 95% Confidence Interval = 3.17-21.74) Were Strongly Associated With An Increased Risk Of Perforation, Whereas The Sensation Of A Foreign Body (Odds Ratio = 0.32; 95% Confidence Interval = 0.09-0.92) Was A Protective Factor Of Perforation. Glucose Level Was Not Observed To Have An Association Among Patients With Or Without Perforation. Conclusions: Diabetes And Duration Of Foreign Body Retention Increase Risk For Esophageal Foreign Bodies Complicated By Perforation, And Cases With Elevated Armpit Temperature May Represented A More Likely Perforation Compared With Those Without Fever.

AB  - Objective: Self-Harm And Attempted Suicide Are Risk Factors For Suicide In Psychiatric Hospital In-Patients. This Study Aimed To Analyse The Circumstances Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts In A Japanese Psychiatric Hospital So As To Improve Management And Care. Methods: Incident Reports Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts During A 12.4-Year Period From November 2000 To March 2013 Were Reviewed. A Descriptive Analysis Was Conducted In Terms Of Age, Sex, And Diagnosis Of Patients, As Well As Level, Ward, Situations, And Causes Of Incidents. Results: During The Study Period, 90 Cases Of Self-Harm And Attempted Suicide Involving 58 Patients Were Reported. The Rate Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts Was 0.05 Per 1000 Patient-Days. The Types Of Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts Included Hanging (N = 25), Wrist Cutting (N = 19), Ingestion Of Foreign Objects (N = 17), And Others (N = 29). The Single Case Of Completed Suicide Involved Hanging, In A Patient With Schizophrenia. Among 55 Patients With Relevant Data, The Most Common Clinical Diagnosis Was Mood Disorder (41.8%), Followed By Schizophrenia (36.4%). Mood Disorder Was 3.5 Times As Prevalent In Females As In Males (14 Vs. 4). Fourteen Patients With Mood Disorder (N = 8) Or Schizophrenia (N = 6) Were Repeatedly Involved In 46 Of 89 Cases Of Self-Harm Or Attempted Suicide; 11 Were Female. One Woman With Mood Disorder Attempted Suicide 9 Times Within The Same Year. The Top 3 Management And Care Factors Related To Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts Were Failure To Adhere To Preventive Procedures (28%), Insufficient Therapeutic Communication (28%), And Difficulty In Predicting Suicide (20%). Conclusion: Self-Harm And Suicide Attempts At This Psychiatric Hospital Occurred At A Rate Of 0.05 Per 1000 Patient-Days Between Late 2000 And Early 2013. Efforts Are Needed To Increase Compliance With Suicide Prevention Procedures And Therapeutic Communication, So As To Improve Management And Care Of Psychiatric In-Patients And Prevent Them From Committing Suicide. © 2018 Hong Kong College Of Psychiatrists.

JO  - Western Journal Of Emergency Medicine
AB  - Introduction: Asphyxiation Or Suffocation Injuries Can Result In Multi-Organ Damage And Are A Major Cause Of Morbidity And Mortality Among Different Age  Groups. This Study Aims To Describe Characteristics Of Patients Presenting With  Suffocation Injuries To Emergency Departments (Eds) In The United States (U.S.)  And To Identify Factors Associated With Mortality In This Population. Methods: We  Conducted A Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study Using The 2013 U.S National  Emergency Department Sample Database. Ed Visits With Primary Diagnoses Of  Intentional Or Accidental Suffocation Injury, And Injury By Inhalation And  Aspiration Of Foreign Bodies Or Food (Icd-9-Cm Codes) Were Included. We Performed  Descriptive Statistics To Describe The Study Population. This Was Followed By  Multivariate Analyses To Identify Factors Associated With Mortality. Results: We  Included A Total Of 27,381 Ed Visits For Suffocation Injuries. Most Suffered From  Either Inhalation And Ingestion Of Food Causing Obstruction Of Respiratory Tract  Or Suffocation (51.6%), Or Suicide And Self-Inflicted Injury By Hanging,  Strangulation, And Suffocation (39.4%). Overall Mortality Was 10.9%. Over Half  (54.7%) Of The Patients Were Between 19 And 65 Years Old. Males Were More Common  Than Females (59.1% Vs. 40.9%). Over Half Of The Patients (54.9%) Were Treated  And Released From The Ed. Factors Associated With Increased Mortality Included  Male Gender, Young Age (4-18 Years), Diseases Of The Cardiac, Respiratory,  Genitourinary And Neurologic Systems, Intentional Self-Harm, And Self-Payer  Status. Conclusion: Mortality From Suffocation Injuries Remains High With  Significant Burden On Children And Adolescents And On Patients With Intentional  Injuries. Tailored Initiatives Targeting Identified Modifiable Factors Through  Implementation Of Behavioral And Environmental Change Can Reduce The Risk Of  Suffocation Injury And Improve Clinical Outcomes Of Affected Victims.

Methods: Children <18Years Old Who  Ingested A Battery Between 1/2011 And 9/2016 At Two Tertiary Care Children'S  Hospitals Were Reviewed. Demographics, Imaging, Management And Outcomes Were  Analyzed Using Descriptive Statistics, Chi-Square And Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Tests.  Results: There Were 180 Battery Ingestions. The Median Age Was 3.9 (Range 0.7-18)  Years, With 78 (43%) Males. The Most Common Symptoms Were Abdominal Pain (17%)  And Nausea/Vomiting (14%). Diagnosis Was Confirmed With Plain Radiographs In 170  (94%) Patients. Locations On Imaging Were: Stomach (37%), Small Bowel (24%),  Esophagus (18%), Colon (11%), And Non-Specific Location Past The Gastroesophageal  Junction (9%). Treatment Was Dictated By Five Different Subspecialties Including  Surgery (35%), Gastroenterology (25%), Emergency Medicine (19%), Primary  Care/Emergency With A Consulting Service (13%), And Otolaryngology (8%). All  Esophageal Batteries (N=33) Had An Intervention. Interventions Included  Fluoroscopic Balloon Extraction (6 Attempted, 33% Retrieval Rate), Rigid  Esophagoscopy (26 Attempted, 96% Retrieval Rate), And Egd (6 Attempted, 83%  Retrieval Rate). For Batteries Distal To The Gastroesophageal Junction 16 (11%)  Patients Had An Intervention. Interventions Included Egd (13 Patients, 69%  Retrieval), Colonoscopy (1 Patient, Successful Retrieval), And Abdominal Surgery  In Two Patients. Conclusion: Isolated Batteries That Pass The Gastroesophageal  Junction Rarely Require Intervention And Can Be Managed Conservatively. Given The  Variability In Managing These Patients, We Developed An Evidence Based Algorithm.  Level Of Evidence: Level 2. Study Type: Retrospective Study.

Removal Through  Flexible Endoscopy Is Generally The First-Line Approach But Rescue Oesophagotomy  May Be Necessary For Foreign Bodies Impacted In The Upper Oesophagus. A  27-Year-Old Man Was Admitted In The Emergency Room After Intentional Ingestion Of  A Wooden Spherical Object With A Central Hole. A Total Body Ct Scan Showed That  The Object Was Completely Obstructing The Upper Oesophageal Lumen But There Were  No Signs Of Perforation. In The Operating Room, A Weerda Diverticuloscope And A  5 Mm 0° Telescope Were Used To Visualise The Foreign Body Under General  Anaesthesia. A Standard Endoscopic Biopsy Forceps Was Passed Through The Hole Of  The Sphere And Was Retracted With The Jaws Open Allowing Transoral Extraction  Without Complications.

AB  - Background: There Is Paucity Of Data Regarding The Prevalence And Methods Of Deliberate Self-Harm (Dsh) In Patients With Heroin Dependence In International Literature. In China, There Have Been A Few Studies Investigating The Prevalence Of Dsh In Heroin-Dependent Patients (Hdps), But Their Rates Varied Widely. We Thus Conducted A Meta-Analysis Of Studies Assessing The Prevalence Of Dsh Among Chinese Hdps. Methods: Relevant Studies Were Retrieved From Major Chinese Databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, And Sinomed) And Western Databases (Pubmed, Embase, And Psycinfo). Two Authors Independently Identified Eligible Studies And Extracted Data. Studies That Included A Representative Sample Of Chinese Hdps And Ascertained Dsh Caseness In A Reliable Way Were Considered As High Quality. Statistical Analysis Was Performed Using R Software. Results: In Total, 15 Eligible Studies With A Total Of 37,243 Chinese Hdps Were Included. All Included Studies Were Conducted In Heroin Detoxification Settings. Only Two Studies Were Rated As High Quality. The Pooled Prevalence Of Dsh In Chinese Hdps Was 4.4% (95%Ci: 2.9, 6.2%), But The Heterogeneity Of Prevalence Rates Across Studies Was Significant (I2 = 98%, P < 0.001). Studies Rated As High Quality Had Significantly Higher Prevalence Of Dsh Than Those Rated As Low Quality (13.2 Vs. 3.4%, P < 0.001). Swallowing Foreign Objects Was The Most Common Method Of Dsh, With A Combined Prevalence Of 2.7% (95%Ci: 1.6, 4.4%). Extreme Dsh Methods Such As Cutting Offfingers And Jumping From Height Were Also Not Uncommon In This Patient Population. Conclusion: Due To Methodological Problems In Available Studies, We Find A Relatively Low Prevalence Of Dsh Among Chinese Hdps Receiving Detoxification Treatment. Nevertheless, The Self-Harmers Of Chinese Hdps Are More Likely To Harm Themselves In A Dangerous Or Life-Threatening Way. Restricting The Availability Of Dsh Methods May Be An Effective Way To Prevent Or Reduce Dsh In China'S Detoxification Treatment Settings. © 2018 Zhong, Xu, Xie, Chen And Lu.

AB  - Purpose: Injuries Related To Button Battery Ingestion Are Common In Children. This Review Provides An Outline Of The Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, Management,  And Anesthetic Implications In Children Who Have Ingested A Button Battery.  Source: A Literature Search Was Conducted In The United States National Library  Of Medicine Pubmed Database Using The Terms "Button Battery Ingestion" And  "Children' And "Removal" And "Surgery" And "Anesthesia". Ninety-Six Articles  Published In English Were Found From 1983-2017, And 62 Of These Articles Were  Incorporated Into This Review. Additionally, The Internet Was Searched With The  Terms "Button Battery Ingestion And Children" To Identify Further Entities,  Organizations, And Resources Affiliated With Button Battery Ingestion In  Children. These Additional Sources Were Studied And Included In This Review.  Principal Findings: Button Batteries Are Ubiquitous In Homes And Electronic  Devices. Since 2006, Larger-Diameter And Higher-Voltage Batteries Have Become  Available. These Are More Likely To Become Impacted In The Esophagus After  Ingestion And Lead To An Increase In Severe Morbidity And Mortality Due To  Caustic Tissue Injury. Children At The Highest Risk For Complications Are Those  Under Six Years Of Age Who Have Ingested Batteries > 20 Mm In Diameter And  Sustain Prolonged Esophageal Impaction At The Level Of The Aortic Arch With The  Negative Pole Oriented Anteriorly. Conclusion: Anesthesiologists Need To Know  About The Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, Complications, And Anesthetic Management  Of Children Who Have Ingested Button Batteries.

AB  - This Study Examined Whether Atypical/Severe Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (Nssi; E.G., Foreign Body Ingestion, Cutting Necessitating Sutures) Serves As A Marker Of Severe Psychopathology Among 467 Adult Community Mental Health Clients (N = 33 With An Atypical/Severe Nssi History). Information Regarding Psychiatric Risk Indicators Was Extracted From Participants’ Psychiatric Records. Generalized Linear Models With Negative Binomial Distribution And Log Link Function, As Well As Chi-Square Tests, Were Used To Address Study Aims. Clients With A Lifetime Atypical/Severe Nssi History Met Criteria For A Significantly Greater Number Of Psychiatric Risk Indicators Than Clients With A Lifetime History Of Common Nssi Only; However, These Clients Were Not Significantly More Likely To Report Recent Suicidal Actions. Individuals With An Atypical/Severe Nssi History May Demonstrate More Severe Psychopathology Than Those With A History Of Common Nssi Only. Thus, It May Be Clinically Useful To Consider Individuals With An Atypical/Severe Nssi History As A High-Risk Subgroup. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

JO  - Current Opinion In Pediatrics
AB  - Purpose Of Review: The Purpose Of This Article Is To Review Clinical Manifestations And Management Of Common Pediatric Foreign Body Ingestions, With A  Particular Focus On Some Of The Current Trends. Recent Findings: Foreign Body  Ingestion (Fbi) Is A Problem That Is Frequently Encountered By Pediatric  Providers. As New Toys And Products Enter The Marketplace, There May Also Be New  Dangers From Those Objects Not Initially Recognized. Some Of The Recent Trends  And Findings In Pediatric Fbi Include An Increase In Adolescent Injury From  Ingestion Of Laundry Detergent Pods Because Of A Popular Game Where Participants  Are Encouraged To Bite Or Swallow The Pods, And Injuries Associated With  Ingesting Parts Of A Popular Toy Known As A 'Fidget Spinner'. Summary: Adverse  Events Resulting From Fbi Range The Entire Gamut From Nonexistent Or Minor  Symptoms To Moderate Injury And Rarely May Be Fatal. Factors Such As Age, Type Of  Object Ingested, Anatomic Location Of The Foreign Body, And Timing From Ingestion  To Receipt Of Medical Attention All Determine The Risk Posed To The Child And  Guide Management Decisions. Because Of The Constant Development Of Products, And  The Potential For The Emergence Of New And Dangerous Trends Among Children,  Continued Surveillance By The Medical Community Is Important In Monitoring And  Managing Injuries Associated With Fbi.

JO  - Annals Of Pediatric Surgery
AB  - Background/Purpose Foreign Body (Fb) Ingestion In Children Is Very Common. Children Can Ingest A Wide Variety Of Fbs. Most Of The Ingested Fbs Pass Spontaneously Through The Gastrointestinal Tract. Other Fbs, Especially Uncommonly Ingested Objects, Can Present With Complications And Need Intervention To Be Extracted. The Aim Of This Study Was To Highlight The Importance Of Timely Intervention To Extract These Fbs. Patients And Methods Between November 2012 And October 2017, Patients Who Presented To Our Department With Variously Ingested Fbs Were Retrospectively Reviewed To Detect Those Who Needed Intervention (Surgical Or Endoscopic) To Extract These Fbs. Results During The Specified Time Period, 480 Patients With Fb Ingestion Presented To Our Department. Out Of These Children, 12 Patients Ingested Uncommon Fbs Or Presented With Symptoms Of Complications Of Impaction And Needed Intervention To Extract These Fbs. Three Patients Ingested Multiple Magnets. Three Patients Ingested Pins Which Were Impacted In And Penetrated The Duodenum. One Patient Ingested A Screw Which Was Impacted In The Appendix. One Patient Ingested A Sticky Rubber Toy Which Was Impacted In The Pylorus. One Patient Ingested Hair (Bezoar), Which Was Also Impacted In The Pylorus. One Patient Ingested A Disk Battery Which Was Impacted In And Penetrated The Esophagus, And All Were Surgically Extracted. One Patient Had A Slipped Stent Of Repaired Choanal Atresia Which Was Impacted In The Gastroesophageal Junction And One Patient With Repaired Tracheoesophageal Fistula Ingested A Stone Which Was Impacted At The Site Of Esophageal Anastomosis, And Both Were Endoscopically Retrieved. Conclusion Children Who Ingested Uncommon Fbs Or Presented Late With Symptoms Of Complications Of Impaction Needed Intervention (Surgically Or Endoscopically) To Extract These Fbs.

JO  - International Journal Of Surgery Case Reports
AB  - Introduction: Foreign Body Ingestion Is A Common Clinical Presentation With Less Than 1% Of The Cases Requiring Surgical Intervention. In This Report, We Present  A Rare Case Of Razor Blades Lodged In The Appendix As A Result Of Intentional  Ingestion. Presentation Of Case: A 25 Year Old Male Prisoner Presented To Our  Hospital With Persistent Right Iliac Fossa Pain After Razor Blade Ingestion.  After 5 Days Of Conservative Management, There Was No Sign Of Transition On  Serial X-Rays. Laparoscopy With Intraoperative Image Intensification Confirmed  The Presence Of The Razor Blades In The Appendix And Appendicectomy Was  Subsequently Performed Without Complications. Discussion: Most Ingested Objected  With Diameter Less Than 2.5 Cm And Length Less Than 6 Cm Can Pass Through The  Gastrointestinal Tract Spontaneously In Less Than One Week. The Entry Of Foreign  Objects Into The Appendix Is Thought To Be Due To Relative Low Motility Of The  Caecum, The Dependent Position Of The Appendix And The Size Of The Appendiceal  Orifice. Radiographic Localisation To The Appendiceal Lumen Was Complicated By  Metallic Artefact, But Was Consistent With Failure To Transit. Appendicectomy Was  Felt To Be The Safest Mode Of Retrieval. Conclusion: Ingested Foreign Body Lodged  In The Appendix Is A Rare Event. Once The Exact Location Is Confirmed, A Simple  Laparoscopic Appendicectomy Can Be Performed To Facilitate The Removal.

JO  - Current Opinion In Pediatrics
AB  - Purpose Of Review: Pediatric Foreign Body Ingestion Is A Common Occurrence That Presents A Challenge Both To Pediatric Gastroenterologists And Primary Care  Providers. Increasing Prevalence Of Smaller, More Technologically Advanced Toys  In The Household Has Resulted In An Increased Exposure To Higher Voltage  Batteries And Powerful Magnets That Carry A High Incidence Of Morbidity And  Mortality. This Review Highlights The Latest Findings Regarding The Patients At  Risk For Button Battery And Magnet Ingestions, The Symptoms Of Presentation, And  Complications Of These Objects In Contributing To Long-Standing Gastrointestinal  Injury. Recent Findings: Button Batteries May Lead To Esophageal Injury Within A  Few Hours. Batteries Retained In The Esophagus Are Larger In Diameter On Average  And Size Is Associated With Esophageal Impaction As Well As Higher Grade  Esophageal Injury. Magnet Ingestions, When Multiple Or With Another Metallic  Object, Are Often Initially Asymptomatic But May Have Acute Worsening, And  Therefore Warrant Close Monitoring. Summary: Button Battery And Magnet Ingestions  Have Increased In Incidence Over The Past Two Decades. Recent Literature  Demonstrates That Higher Voltage, Larger Lithium Button Batteries, And Prevalence  Of High-Powered Magnets Can Lead To Significant Morbidity. High Suspicion, Early  Referral, And Removal May Lead To Improved Outcomes.

AB  - Objective: Ingestion Of Sharp Foreign Bodies Is A Less Frequently Encountered Method Of Selfharm. This Study Aims To Follow Up Patients Presenting With Foreign  Body (Fb) Ingestion Requiring Urgent Endoscopic Intervention Under General  Anaesthetic In Theatre, Characterise Each Patient And Establish Whether Admission  Or Removal Of The Fb Promotes Further Self-Harm. Method: Eleven Adult Patients,  Totalling 38 Presentations Over A 28-Month Period Were Identified. Each Was  Followed Up From An Initial Presentation Requiring Endoscopy. Result: 9/11  (81.9%) Where Transferred Either From Prison Or Psychiatric Care With An  Extensive History Of Multimodal And Usually Violent Self-Harm. Of These 8/9  (88.9%) Had A Formal Psychiatric Diagnosis Linked To Their Previous Self-Harm.  Objects Retrieved Included Pens, Razor Blades, Cutlery, Wiring, Batteries, A  Metal Screw And A Tv Aerial. The Median Time Between Presentations With Self-Harm  Was 11 Days. Those Discharged From The Emergency Department Re-Presented After A  Median Of 7.5 Days. This Was Longer, At 14 Days, If Admitted To Hospital; With  Those Having Endoscopic Procedures Re-Presenting After A Median Of 11 Days.  Conclusions: Inpatient Endoscopic Removal Of The Fb Was Not Associated With An  Earlier Presentation With Further Self-Harm When Compared With Discharge Straight  Form A+E, But Was Frequently Repeated, Often In A Characterised Manner.

JO  - Pediatric Surgery International
AB  - Purpose: We Aim To Evaluate The Sociodemographic And Medical Features Of Child-Aged Refugee Patients And Identify Their Health-Related Problems. Methods:  Refugee Children Admitted To Pediatric Surgery Department Of A Teaching Hospital  During The Years 2012-2017 Were Included. Patients' Files Were Reviewed  Retrospectively For Sociodemographic And Medical Features. Results: A Total Of  254 Patients With The Mean Age Of 4.6 ± 4.15 Years (0-16 Years) Were Treated.  Male-To-Female Ratio Was 1.7. Most Common Diagnosis Were Inguino-Scrotal  Pathologies (N = 50, 19.7%) Followed By Foreign Body Ingestion (N = 37, 14.6%)  And Corrosive Esophagitis (N = 22, 8.7%). The Cause Of Admission Was A  Potentially Preventable Trauma In 24.4% Of Cases. Comorbid Medical Conditions  Were Present In 49 Patients (19.3%). Anemia Was Detected In 23.2% Of Cases.  Weight According To Age And Gender Were < 3 Percentile In 29.1% Of Patients.  Difficulties In Communication, Lack Of Former Medical History And Advanced  Presentation Of Disease Were The Challenges Faced By Caregivers. Conclusion: The  Primary Diagnoses For Admission Of Refugee Children Were Different From The  Routine Practice And A Significant Part Were From Preventable Causes.  Comorbidities Were Common Potentially Having A Negative Influence On Treatment  Processes. This Can Be A Result Of Unfavorable Living Conditions And Lack Of  Medical Care During Migration.

JO  - Iranian Journal Of Psychiatry And Behavioral Sciences
AB  - Introduction: In Factitious Disorder (Munchausen Syndrome), Patients Induce Or Aggravate Symptoms Of Physical Or Psychological Illness To Receive Attention And Medical Treatment. The Motivation Of These Patients Is Merely Getting A Sick Role And Medical Care, And Entering The Medical System; Most Of These Patients Have Simultaneous Mood Disorders (Especially Depression), Or Personality Disorders. Patients With Factitious Disorder Have No Secondary Gain. Case Presentation: Herein, We Present A Middle-Aged Azerbaijani Man From Sarab City, East Azerbaijan Who Referred To Hospital With Complaints Of Abdominal And Leg Pain. Based On Examinations, He Had Undergone Repeated Surgical Procedures (Laparotomy And Surgical Removal Of The External Object From The Leg) Due To The Presence Of A Foreign Body (Needle And Nail) In The Intestines And Leg'S Calf. The Interview Was Done Based On Dsm-5 By A Psychiatrist And After A Two-Month Follow-Up, The Diagnosis Was Affirmed By A Second Opinion Through A Ground Round Session At The Department Of Psychiatry, Tabriz University Of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. He Is Under Treatment With An Ssri Along With Cognitive Psychotherapy. Conclusions: Patients With Atypical And Unusual Manifestations Of An Illness Associated With Frequent Hospital Admissions And Receiving Multiple Therapies Can Lead Us To The Diagnosis Of A Factitious Disorder. Although Patients Often Deny Their Disease And Evade Treatment, He Was Ultimately Diagnosed With Factitious Disorder And Received Psychiatric Treatment. The Treatment Goal Is To Reduce Mortality And Morbidity And To Treat The Underlying Psychiatric Disorder.

AB  - Purpose: Safety Pin Ingestion Is Common In Some Regions Of The World And May Lead To Severe Morbidity And Mortality. The Aim Of This Study Was To Present Some  Practical Suggestions For Ingested Safety Pins Using An Accompanying Algorithm,  Presented For The First Time In The Literature To The Best Of Our Knowledge.  Methods: Twenty Children With Ingested Safety Pins During A 4-Year Period Were  Retrospectively Included In The Study. Results: Median Age Of Patients Was 9.5  Months (Interquartile Range, 6.3-14 Months), And 70% Were Girls. On Endoscopic  Examination, Safety Pins Were Observed In The Stomach (25%), Duodenal Bulb (20%),  Upper Esophagus (15%), Middle Esophagus (10%), And Second Part Of The Duodenum  (10%) But Were Not Observed In 20% Of The Cases. Safety Pins Were Removed Using  Endoscopy In 15 Cases (75%). In Four Cases (20%), No Safety Pin Was Observed On  Endoscopic Examination. In One Case (5%) Involving A 6-Month-Old Infant, The  Safety Pin Could Not Be Removed Although It Was Observed Using Endoscopy. No  Surgical Intervention Was Needed For Any Patient. No Complications Such As  Perforation Or Deaths Developed, Except For Erosions, Due To The Foreign Body  Removal Procedure. Conclusion: Safety Pins Are Easily Removed Endoscopically. The  Best Option Is To Remove The Safety Pin Using Endoscopy While It Is Still In The  Esophagus And Stomach. For This Reason, Endoscopic Procedures Should Be Performed  As Soon As Possible In Children Who Have Ingested Safety Pins.

JO  - Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition
AB  - Foreign Body (Fb) Ingestion Of Children Is A Common Pediatric Emergency Requiring Medical Attention. Pediatric Emergency Physicians And Gastroenterologists Often  Encounter Nervous And Distressed Situations, Because Of Children Presenting With  This Condition In The Common Clinical Practice. When Determining The Appropriate  Timing And Indications For Intervention, Physicians Should Consider Multiple  Patient- And Fb-Related Factors. The Utilization Of A Flexible Endoscopy Is  Considered Safe And Effective To Use In These Cases, With A High Success Rate,  For The Effective Extraction Of Fbs From The Gastrointestinal Tract Of A Child.  Additionally, A Foley Catheter And A Magnet-Attached Levin Tube Have Been Used  For Decades In The Case Of Fb Removal. Although Their Use Has Decreased  Significantly In Recent Times, These Instruments Continue To Be Used For Several  Indications. Using A Foley Catheter For This Purpose Does Not Require Special  Training And Does Not Necessarily Require Sedation Of The Patient Or Fluoroscopy,  Which Serve As Advantages Of Utilizing This Method For Foreign Object Retrieval.  An Ingested Magnet Or Iron-Containing Fb Can Be Retrieved Using A Magnet-Attached  Tube, And Can Be Effective To Retrieve An Object From Any Section Of The Upper  Gastrointestinal Tract That Can Be Reached. Simple And Inexpensive Devices Such  As Foley Catheters And Magnet-Attached Tubes Can Be Used In Emergencies Such As  With The Esophageal Impaction Of Disk Batteries If Endoscopy Cannot Be Performed  Immediately (E.G., In Rural Areas And/Or In Patients Presenting At Midnight In A  Facility, Especially In Those Without Access To Endoscopes Or Emergency Services,  Or In Any Situation That Warrants Urgent Removal Of A Foreign Object).

AB  - Purpose: To Investigate Predictive Risk Factors For Complications Associated With Migrating Fish Bones In The Surrounding Tissue Of Upper Gastrointestinal Tract.  Methods: A Retrospective Analysis Over 12 Years Was Conducted Of 45 Cases Of  Buried Fish Bones In The Surrounding Tissue Of Upper Gastrointestinal Tract With  Complications. Meanwhile, A Control Group, Including 39 Cases Of Prolonged Buried  Fish Bones In The Surrounding Tissue Of Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Without  Complications, Was Set. Patient Clinical Data Were Collected And Analyzed To  Predict The Risk Factors For Complications. Results: The Results Of Chi-Square  Test And Univariate Analysis Both Showed A Significant Difference In Length Of  Fish Bone (> 2 Cm), A History Of Concurrent Medical Illness (Diabetes Mellitus  And Renal Hypofunction), Symptoms (Medium Or Heavy Pain And Dysphagia), And  Duration Of Significant Symptoms (> 7 Days) Between The Complication Group And  Non-Complication Group. Multivariate Analysis Further Identified Length (> 2 Cm),  Diabetes Mellitus, Medium Or Heavy Pain, Dysphagia, And Duration Of Significant  Symptoms (> 7 Days) As Independent Risk Factors For Complications. Conclusions:  The Consequences Of Fish Bones Migrating Outside The Upper Gastrointestinal Tract  Are Various In Different People. Awareness Should Be Raised When Encountering A  Patient Ingesting A Long Fish Bone, Having A History Of Diabetes Mellitus,  Presenting With Significant Discomforts, Or These Discomforts Lasting For A Long  Time. This Study Will Help Practitioners Counsel Their Patients On The Risks And  `Benefits Of Surgery Versus Observation Of This Condition.

AB  - Background: About 90% Of Perianal Infection Is Caused By Cryptoglandular Infection. Only A Few Cases Of Peritonitis Or Intra-Abdominal Abscesses Secondary  To Perforation Of The Digestive Tract By An Ingested Foreign Body Have Been  Reported. The Most Common Sites Of Impaction And Perforation Include The  Appendix, Cecum And The Terminal Ileum. The Rectum Is An Unusual Site Of Foreign  Body Impaction. This Report Intends To Highlight That Ingested Foreign Body  Impacted In The Rectum Is An Extremely Rare Cause Of Perianal Abscess And  Subsequent Fistula In Infants. Case Summary: Two Cases Of Perianal Abscess And  Fistula Due To Ingested Jujube Pit Impacted In The Rectum Are Reported. Both  Cases Are Infants With Free Previous Medical History Suffered From Recurrent  Perianal Infection. The Caregivers Of The Two Patients Denied Ingestion Of A  Foreign Body Or Any History Of Trauma. Physical Examination Combined With  Ultrasound Or Computed Tomography Scan Established The Diagnosis. Both Of The  Patients Underwent Operation Under General Anesthesia. In Case 1, A Jujube Pit  With Sharp Ends Was Discovered Embedded Within A Subcutaneous Fistula. The Jujube  Pit Was Then Removed Intact Along With Fistula Resection. The Wound Was  Successfully Laid Open To Allow Healing By Secondary Intention. In Case 2, A  Jujube Pit Was Found With Its Sharp End Puncturing The Rectum, Surrounded By Pus  And Necrotic Tissue. Subsequent Incision And Adequate Drainage Were Performed.  The Whole Jujube Pit Was Then Removed From The Abscess Cavity At The Same Time.  Both Patients Received Colonoscopy To Rule Out Inflammatory Bowel Disease Or  Other Potential Damages By The Ingested Jujube Pit. The Postoperative Period Was  Uneventful. At 1.5 Year Follow-Up, No Recurrent Abscess Or Fistula Were Found In  Either Patient. Conclusion: An Impacted Foreign Body Must Not Be Overlooked As An  Unusual Cause Of Perianal Abscess And Fistula, Especially In Young Children.

AB  - Background: Injury Remains A Leading Cause Of Childhood Morbidity And Mortality In The Developing World. The Probability Of Injury Occurrence Is Influenced By  Agent, Host And Environmental Factors. Studies Of Repeat Injuries In Childhood  Therefore Provide Insight Into Factors In The Epidemiological Triad Predisposing  Children To Injury. Objectives: To Determine The Proportion Of Children And The  Factors Associated With Repeat Presentations To The Red Cross War Memorial  Children'S Hospital Trauma Unit (Rcwmch Tu) In Cape Town, South Africa, For All  Non-Transport-Related Injuries In Childhood. Methods: This Was A Retrospective  Cohort Study Using Data From The Rcwmch Tu. We Included Children Aged 0 - 10  Years With First Presentation From January 1997 To June 2013 And Followed Up  Until The Earlier Of Age 13 Years Or June 2016. We Assessed Individual And  Population-Level Factors Associated With Repeat Injury Using Multilevel Poisson  Regression Analysis. Child Dependency Ratios Were Derived From The 2011 National  Census. Results: Between 1997 And 2013, 72 490 Children Aged &Lt;10 Years (59%  Male) Presented To The Rcwmch Tu For The First Time With Injuries. After The  Initial Injury, 9 417 (13%) Presented With A Repeat Injury By 2016 And Before Age  13 Years. After Adjusting For Health Subdistrict, Distance From Rcwmch Tu And Age  At First Presentation, Factors Associated With Reduced Repeat Presentation Were  Injury Identified As Due To Abuse (Adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio (Airr) 0.6; 95%  Confidence Interval (Ci) 0.4 - 0.7), Fluid Burn (Airr 0.6; 95% Ci 0.6 - 0.7),  Foreign Body Ingestion (Airr 0.7; 95% Ci 0.7 - 0.9), And Moderate And Severe (V.  Minor) Initial Injury (Airr 0.9; 95% Ci 0.8 - 0.9 And Airr 0.7; 95% Ci 0.6 - 0.8,  Respectively), While Boys Were More Likely To Have Repeat Injury Presentations  (Airr 1.4; 95% Ci 1.4 - 1.5). Conclusions: Repeat Presentations Were Substantial  And Associated With Male Gender. They Occurred Less Commonly After Fluid Burn  Injuries, Foreign Body Ingestion And Moderate To Severe Injuries. Children With  Intentional Injuries Were Also Less Likely To Have A Repeat Presentation. Further  Research Is Indicated For Childhood Injuries With Greater Propensity To Repeat,  Including Non-Height Falls And Sport-Related Injuries. Secondary Injury  Prevention Education Should Not Neglect Patients With Unintentional And Minor  Injuries. These Results Strengthen The Hypothesis That Injuries Arise As A Result  Of Sustained Exposure To Agent, Host And Environmental Risk Factors.

AB  - Purpose: To Describe The Incidence And Management Of Gastrointestinal Tract Buckyball Magnets Ingestions In A Multicenter Chinese Pediatric Patient  Population, And Discuss The Preventive Measures. Methods: Medical Records Of 74  Pediatric Patients From 9 Large Chinese Hospitals During The Past 10 Years, Who  Were Diagnosed As Buckyball Magnets Ingestion And Got Invasive Treatment, Were  Retrospectively Studied. The Follow-Up Was Through Telephone And Outpatient  Service To Estimate The Post-Surgery Condition. Information Collection Was  Through Online Questionnaire. Results: Among The 74 Cases, There Were 50 Boys  (68%) And 24 Girls (32%). The Median Age Was 36 (Interquartile Range (Iqr) 22-77)  Months, With A Range Of 7 Months To 11 Years, And It Showed Two Peaks, The First  Between 1 And 3 Years, And The Second Between 6 To 11 Years. The Annual Case  Number Showed A Sharp Increase Over Time, And The Total Case Number In The Last  2 Years (2017 And 2018) Showed A Greater Than 9-Fold Increase When Compared With  The First 2 Years (2013 And 2014). The Majority Of Ingestions Were Unintentional,  With Only 3 Patients Deliberately Swallowing The Buckyball Magnets. The Median  Time Of Ingestion Until The Onset Of Emergent Symptoms Was 2 (Iqr 1-5) Days, And  Ranged From 4 H To 40 Days. Twenty-One Patients Had No Symptoms, And The  Remaining Cases Presented With Abdominal Pain, Vomiting, Fever, Abdominal  Distension, Excessive Crying, Melena, And The Ceasing Of Flatus And Defecation.  Gastroscopy, Colonoscopy, Laparoscopic Surgery And Laparotomy Surgery Were  Performed In Accordance With The Algorithm From The North American Society Of  Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology And Nutrition (Naspghan). Procedural And  Operative Findings Included Gastrointestinal Mucosa Erosion, Ischemia And  Necrosis, Perforation, And Abdominal Abscess, Fistula And Intestinal Obstruction.  The Median Number Of Buckyball Magnets Ingested Was 4 (Iqr 2-8), With A Range  From 1 To 39. During The Median Follow-Up Period Of 6 (Iqr 1-15) Months, 3  Patients Had Intestinal Obstruction, And One Underwent A Second Operation. The  Remaining 71 Patients Courses Were Uneventful During The Follow-Up Period. None  Of The 74 Patients Reported A Second Swallowing Of Foreign Bodies. Conclusions:  The Incidence Of Pediatric Gastrointestinal Tract Magnets Ingestion In China Is  Increasing. Management Of Such Patients Should Follow The Naspghan Algorithm.  Preventive Measures To Limit Children'S Access To Buckyball Magnets Should Be  Taken From Three Levels, Namely The National Administration, Producer, And  Consumer.

AB  - Objective. The Purpose Of This Study Was To Evaluate Findings At Serial Mri After Endoscopic Removal Of A Button Battery From The Esophagus In A Series Of  Pediatric Patients. Materials And Methods. Serial Mri Examinations After Removal  Of A Button Battery From The Esophagus Were Reviewed Retrospectively For The  Presence Of Mediastinal Edema; Imaging Characteristics Of The Aorta And Arteries;  Imaging Characteristics Of The Trachea; And Imaging Characteristics Of The  Esophageal Wall At The Level Of Injury. Results. A Total Of 48 Mri Examinations  Were Performed On 19 Patients, 89% (17/19) In The First 48 Hours After Battery  Removal. Serial Mri Was Performed For 84% (16/19) Of Patients. Initial Mri Showed  Extensive Mediastinal Edema In All 17 Patients Who Underwent Mri In The First 48  Hours. Edema Directly Abutted Major Arteries In All 17 Patients And Abutted The  Airway In All 10 Patients With Proximal Esophageal Injury. Arterial Vascular  Changes Were Seen In 30% (3/10) Of Patients With Proximal Esophageal Injury And  57% (4/7) Of Patients With Mid Or Distalesophageal Injury. Airway Changes Were  Seen In 80% (8/10) Of Patients With Proximal Esophageal Injury. Serial Mri Showed  Improvement Of Airway Changes In All Patients And Improvement In Vessel Wall  Changes In All But One (25%, 1/4) Of The Patients Who Had Mid Or Distal  Esophageal Injury. Four Patients (21% [4/19]) Had Contained Esophageal Leak On  Esophagrams. No Patients In Our Series Developed A Tracheoesophageal Or  Vascular-Enteric Fistula. Conclusion. Our Case Series Provides Important  Information On Natural History Of Mri Findings In Children After Endoscopic  Removal Of A Button Battery From The Esophagus. Further Studies Are Needed To  Determine The Imaging Findings Most Sensitive And Specific For Severe  Complications, Such As Tracheoesophageal Fistula And Vascular-Enteric Fistula.

AB  - Ingested Toothpicks Are A Relatively Rare Event, But They May Cause Serious Gut Injuries And Can Be Listed Among Rare Causes Of Perforation, Peritonitis, Sepsis  Or Death. Unless The Foreign Bodies Were Intentionally Swallowed, Many Patients  Who Ingested Them Fail To Remember The Event And They Do Not Refer It During The  Medical History Collection; This Makes Diagnosis Problematic. In This Work, A  Case Of Perforation Of The Sigmoid Colon Is Described, Caused By A Toothpick  Ingestion. The Patient Had To Be Surgically Treated Because Of A Complication:  The Formation Of An Entero-Iliac Fistula With Subsequent Development Of A  Pseudoaneurysm Of The Right External Iliac Artery. Vascular Perforation Due To  Toothpick Ingestion Has Rarely Been Reported. In Similar Cases, It Could Be  Difficult To Establishing The Correct Diagnosis Because Of The Low Sensitivity  And Accuracy Rates Of Diagnostic Investigations. The Ingestion Of Foreign Bodies  Should Be Kept In Mind As An Important Differential Diagnosis In Patients With  Acute Abdomen Or Chronic Abdominal Pain Of Unknown Origin.

AB  - Objectives: Ingestion Of A Foreign Body Can Cause Different Degrees Of Damage To Esophagus, And Several Complications Are Potentially Life-Threatening If Not  Properly Handled. The Aortic Injury Caused By A Perforating Esophageal Foreign  Body Is Rare But Lethal. The Optimal Management Still Remains Controversial. The  Purpose Of This Report Is To Describe Our Experience In The Management Of The  Aortic Injury Caused By Esophageal Foreign Body Ingestion. Methods: Between  January 2015 And December 2015, We Retrospectively Enrolled Cases Of Esophageal  Perforation Involving The Aorta By Foreign Body. The General Parameters,  Esophageal Foreign Body, Types Of Aortic Injury, Treatment, And Outcome Were  Analyzed. Additionally, We Reviewed The Literature Of The Management Of  Esophageal Perforation Involving The Aorta Caused By Foreign Bodies. The Study  Was Approved By The Ethics Committee Of The First Affiliated Hospital, College Of  Medicine, Zhejiang University, And The Need For Informed Consent Was Waived  (Quick Review 2019, No. 609). Results: Three Cases Of Esophageal Perforation  Involving The Aorta By Foreign Body Was Selected In The Study. Two Male And 1  Female Patients (Range, 51-58 Years Old) With The Aorta Involvement Caused By A  Perforating Foreign Body In The Esophagus In 3 Forms Were Identified, Including 1  Patient With Mycotic Aortic Pseudoaneurysm, 1 Patient With Aortoesophageal  Fistula And 1 Patient With The Aortic Intramural Hematoma. One Patient Died Of  The Rupture Of The Pseudoaneurysm During The Preparation Of The Surgery. The  Other 2 Patients Were Cured With A Multidisciplinary Approach, Which Is An Urgent  Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair Followed By Mediastinal Debridement/Drainage  Or Endoscopic Retrieval. Two Of 3 Patients Were Survived Until Now. Conclusion:  The Management Of The Aortic Injury Caused By Esophageal Foreign Body Injury Is  Challenging. Early Diagnosis And Multidisciplinary Management Is Crucial.

AB  - Backgrounds: Previous Reports Of Foreign-Body Ingestion Focused Primarily On Accidental Ingestion And Very Few Studies Focused On Intentional Ingestion Of  Foreign Body (Fb) In China. Our Study Aimed To Compare The Prevalence Of  Different Age, Gender, Types, Locations And Management Of Fb Ingested Between  Intentional Ingestion And Accidental Ingestion Of Fb In Northern China. Methods:  A Retrospective Case Series Studied All Patients With Suspected Fb Ingestion In  Digestive Endoscopy Center Of Beijing Friendship Hospital, Between January 2011  And January 2019. The Patients Were Divided Into 2 Groups. Group A Included The  Patients Who Intentionally Ingested Fbs, And Group B Included The Patients Who  Accidentally Ingested Fbs. Patients' Database (Demographics, Past Medical  History, Characteristics Of Fb, Endoscopic Findings And Treatments) Were  Reviewed. Statistical Analyses Were Conducted Using Spss Software. Results: Group  A Consisted Of 77 Prisoners, 2 Suspects And 11 Psychologically Disabled Persons.  Group B Consisted Of 1020 Patients With No Prisoners, Suspects Or Psychologically  Disabled Persons. In Group A, There Were No Food-Related Foreign Bodies, And The  Majority Of Fbs Were Metallic Objects (54.44%). However In Group B, Food-Related  Fbs Were The Most Common (91.37%). In Group A, 58 Cases (64.44%) Were Located In  The Stomach, While In Group B, 893 Cases (87.55%) Were Located In The Esophagus  (P < 0.05). 1096 Patients Successfully Underwent Endoscopic Removal And 14  Failed, Including 9 Cases In Group A And 5 Cases In Group B. The Duration Of Fbs  Impaction Was Longer In Group A Than That In Group B (P < 0.05). Conclusions: In  Our Study, The Patients Who Intentionally Ingested Fb Were Mainly Prisoners, Fbs  Were Mostly Sharp Metallic Objects, The Duration Of Fbs Impaction Was Longer, And  The Rate Of Successful Endoscopic Treatment Was Lower Than That Of The General  Population. Attention Should Be Focused On These Patients.

AB  - Purpose: The Pillar Palatal Implant System Is A Minimally Invasive Procedure For The Treatment Of Obstructive Sleep Apnea And Snoring. Prior Studies Have Examined  The Effectiveness Of This Procedure, However No Prior Study Has Thoroughly  Evaluated Its Complications. We Anticipate That This Analysis Will Provide  Valuable Insight Into These Procedures Which Can Be Used In Patient Education And  Post-Operative Follow-Up. Materials And Methods: The Manufacturer And User  Facility Device Experience (Maude) Database Was Queried For Cases Reporting  Injury Related To The Pillar Procedure. The Case Narratives Were Individually  Analyzed And Categorized By Type Of Complication. A Comparison Of Extruding Parts  And Select Complications Was Also Performed Using Chi-Square Analysis. Results:  Of The 261 Cases Reported, 73.6% Reporting Extruding Parts, 47.5% Described  Patient Pain, And 38.7% Included Patients Describing A Foreign Body Sensation.  Infection Was Reported In 7.7% Of The Cases With Cellulitis And Abscess Formation  Specifically Mentioned In One Case. Cases Describing Pain And Difficulty  Swallowing Were Significantly More Likely To Have Reported Extruding Parts  (P < 0.05). Conclusions: This Study Describes Various Complications Associated  With This Procedure. The Description Of These Complications And Accompanying  Literature Review May Provide Healthcare Professionals And Patients With An  Understanding Of The Scope Of Adverse Events Related To This Procedure.

AB  - A Multidisciplinary Medical Team Considers Extraordinary Treatment To Prevent Self-Harm In An Adolescent With Recurrent And Intentional Fbi Resulting In Repeat Medical Intervention. Mental Health Disorders In Adolescents Present Some Of The Most Challenging Of All Ethical Dilemmas. This Is Particularly True When They Lead To Self-Injurious Behavior That Can Only Be Prevented By Either Limiting The Freedom Of The Adolescent Or Forcing Treatments On Them That They Do Not Want. Intentional And Repeated Foreign-Body Ingestion (Fbi) In Youth Is A Poorly Understood Self-Injurious Behavior That Can Be Life-Threatening. It Poses Unique Clinical And Ethical Challenges. Ingestion Of Sharp Or Magnetic Objects Increases The Need For Endoscopic Retrieval Or Surgical Intervention With Associated Risks, Including Perforation And Anesthesia-Related Adverse Events. When Behavior Modification Efforts Fail To Prevent Recurrent Fbi, The Cumulative Risk Of Medical Intervention Mounts. Sometimes, As A Last Resort, Doctors Consider Surgical Procedures That Limit Jaw Movement And May Physically Prevent Recurrent Fbi. In This Ethics Rounds Article, We Present A Case In Which Doctors Consider Whether It Is In The Best Interest Of A Teenager With This Behavior To Undergo Orthodontic Jaw Wiring As A Next Step In Treatment Of Repeated Fbi. Doctor Commentary On The Ethical Decision-Making Process Is Provided.

AB  - Background And Aims: Foreign Body Ingestions (Fobis) Are A Common Cause For Medical Attention. However, Trends And Patterns Of Adult Fobis As Well As Associations With Clinical Comorbidities And Behavioral Attributes Have Not Been Elucidated Beyond Single Institutional Experiences. Methods: We Utilized Survey Data From The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System To Examine Fundamental Characteristics Of Adult Fobis Involving Consumer Products Between 2000 And 2017 Across The United States. Data Regarding The Circumstances Of Fobis Were Abstracted From Narrative Data. Relationships Among Time, Intent, Demographics, And Behavioral Attributes Were Assessed Using Regression Analyses, Accounting For Survey Structure. Results: Adult Fobis Have Increased In Incidence Over The Past 2 Decades From 3 To 5.3 Per 100,000 Persons. Examination Of Consumer Products Revealed That Jewelry (15.4%), Nails (7.2%), And Toothpicks (6.9%) Were The Most Commonly Ingested Products. The Most Common Products Ingested Varied Over Time, And The Number Of Unique Consumer Product Categories Ingested Increased From 103 To 143 In The Time Period Studied. Intentional Ingestions Accounted For 14% Of Adult Fobis And Frequently Involved Plastic Bagging (13.6%), Batteries (13%), Nails (10.1%), And Desk Supplies (6.8%). Adjusted Regression Analyses Demonstrated That Compared With Accidental Fobis, Intentional Fobis Have Increased Over Time. Intentional Fobis Were More Frequently Associated With Younger Age, Substance Abuse, Police Custody, And Mental And Cognitive Illnesses Relative To Accidental Fobis. Conclusions: Our Results Indicate That Adult Fobis Are An Increasing Burden Of Disease In The United States With Social, Psychiatric, And Behavioral Contributors To This Trend.

JO  - Annals Of Medicine And Surgery (2012)
AB  - Introduction: The Swallowing Of Foreign Bodies Can Be Accidental Or Intentional. The Majority Of The Cases Of Accidental Foreign Body Ingestion Are Observed In  Children. In Adults, Foreign Body Ingestion Can Be Accidental, Related To  Specific Pathological Changes Of The Digestive Tract, Or Deliberate, As Observed  In Patients With Psychiatric Diseases Or In Those Released From The Prison. Case  Presentation: A 42-Year-Old Male Was Admitted To The Emergency Department With  Symptoms Including Choking, Drooling From The Mouth, Holding His Neck, And  Aphonia. He Had A History Of Psychiatric Illness With Suicidal Ingestion Of A  Foreign Body. After Stabilization, He Was Sent For Chest Radiograph, Which  Revealed A Significant Radiopaque Shadow The Shape Of A Spanner, Occupying The  Whole Length Of The Esophagus. Emergency Rigid Esophagoscopy Was Performed To  Save The Patient'S Life. Discussion: The Patient Swallowed The Largest Hard  Foreign Body To Harm Himself Or His Family, To Get The Attention Of His Family,  Or As A Suicide Attempt. Such Patients Require Urgent Intervention By Rigid  Esophagoscopy To Reduce The Risk Of Complications And To Save The Patients'  Lives. Further Follow-Up Is Essential Due To The Possibility Of Repeated Foreign  Body Ingestion. Conclusion: While Taking Care Of Psychiatric Patients, Close  Observation By Family Members Is Mandatory To Prevent Them From Harming  Themselves And To Prevent Suicide Attempts By Swallowing Sharp, Hard, Large, And  Dangerous Foreign Bodies Such As The Size 17 Wrench Spanner Observed In The  Present Case.

AB  - Ingested Foreign Object (Fob) Is A Common Complaint In The Emergency Department (Ed), Especially In Pediatric Patients. While Many Fob Ingestions Are Benign,  Sharp Objects, Including Razor Blades, Are Of Particular Concern Given The Acute  Risk Of Perforation Throughout The Gastrointestinal Tracts. The Majority Of Razor  Blade Ingestions Involve Prisoners And Psychiatric Patients, Which Can Complicate  The Diagnosis And Treatment. Although Literature Suggests That Risks Of  Perforation And Complication May Be High, Limited Research Available On Sharp Fob  Ingestions Supports A General Non-Interventional Strategy. Instead, Close  Follow-Up And Serial Radiographs For Natural Passage Are Recommended For The  Majority Of Cases. We Highlight The Case Of A 17-Year-Old Female Who Presented To  The Ed For Suspected Fob Ingestion And Was Found To Have A Singular 3.0 X 0.5 Cm  Razor Blade On Abdominal Radiograph Following An Unremarkable Initial Evaluation.  In Line With Prior Literature, Surgical Consult Supported Natural Passage With  Serial Radiographs, And The Patient Was Subsequently Discharged Home With A  Recommended Bulk Food Diet.

AB  - Button Batteries Are The Second Most Frequently-Ingested Foreign Bodies And Can Lead To Serious Clinical Complications Within Hours Of Ingestion. The Purpose Of  This Study Was To Analyze The Outcomes Of 14 Children With Button Batteries  Lodged In The Upper Gastrointestinal Tract.Totally 14 Children With Button  Batteries Lodged In The Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Were Included. The Diagnosis  Was Made Primarily By The History Of Button Battery Ingestion, Physical  Examination And Chest-Abdomen X-Ray Examination.The Button Batteries Lodged In  The Esophagus Were Removed By Esophagoscope, And Those In The Gastrointestinal  Tract Were Under Observation. Among 10 Children With Batteries In The First  Esophageal Stenosis, 9 Were Cured And 1 Suffered From Tracheoesophageal Fistula.  One Case Of Battery In The Second Esophageal Stenosis Was Dead Due To  Intercurrent Aortoesophageal Fistula. Two Cases Of Batteries In The Third  Esophageal Stenosis Were Cured After Removal, And 1 Case Of The Battery In The  Gastrointestinal Tract Discharged Spontaneously.Ingested Button Batteries Are  Mainly Lodged In The Esophageal Stenoses And Are Easy To Cause Esophageal Injury  And Severe Complications. Early Detection, Prompt Treatment, Strengthening  Observation And Regular Follow-Up After Discharge May Help To Decrease The  Incidence Of Complications And Improve The Outcomes.

JO  - Cochrane Database Of Systematic Reviews
AB  - Abstract - Background Impaction Of A Soft Food Bolus In The Oesophagus Causes Dysphagia And Regurgitation. If The Bolus Does Not Pass Spontaneously, Then The Patient Is At Risk Of Aspiration, Dehydration, Perforation, And Death. Definitive Management Is With Endoscopic Intervention, Recommended Within 24 Hours. Prior To Endoscopy, Many Patients Undergo A Period Of Observation, Awaiting Spontaneous Disimpaction, Or May Undergo Enteral Or Parenteral Treatments To Attempt To Dislodge The Bolus. There Is Little Consensus As To Which Of These Conservative Strategies Is Safe And Effective To Be Used In This Initial Period, Before Resorting To Definitive Endoscopic Management For Persistent Impaction. Objectives To Evaluate The Efficacy Of Non‐Endoscopic Conservative Treatments In The Management Of Soft Food Boluses Impacted Within The Oesophagus. Search Methods We Searched The Following Databases, Using Relevant Search Terms: Cochrane Central Register Of Controlled Trials (Central), Medline, Embase And Cinahl. The Date Of The Search Was 18 August 2019. We Screened The Reference Lists Of Relevant Studies And Reviews On The Topic To Identify Any Additional Studies. Selection Criteria We Included Randomised Controlled Trials Of The Management Of Acute Oesophageal Soft Food Bolus Impaction, In Adults And Children, Reporting The Incidence Of Disimpaction (Confirmed Radiologically Or Clinically By Return To Oral Diet) Without The Need For Endoscopic Intervention. We Did Not Include Studies Focusing On Sharp Or Solid Object Impaction. Data Collection And Analysis We Used Standard Methodological Procedures Recommended By Cochrane. Main Results We Identified 890 Unique Records Through The Electronic Searches. We Excluded 809 Clearly Irrelevant Records And Retrieved 81 Records For Further Assessment. We Subsequently Included One Randomised Controlled Trial That Met The Eligibility Criteria, Which Was Conducted In Four Swedish Centres And Randomised 43 Participants To Receive Either Intravenous Diazepam Followed By Glucagon, Or Intravenous Placebos. The Effect Of The Active Substances Compared With Placebo On Rates Of Disimpaction Without Intervention Is Uncertain, As The Numbers From This Single Study Were Small, And The Rates Were Similar (38% Versus 32%; Risk Ratio 1.19, 95% Confidence Interval 0.51 To 2.75, P = 0.69). The Certainty Of The Evidence Using Grade For This Outcome Is Low. Data On Adverse Events Were Lacking. Authors' Conclusions There Is Currently Inadequate Data To Recommend The Use Of Any Enteral Or Parenteral Treatments In The Management Of Acute Oesophageal Soft Food Bolus Impaction. There Is Also Inadequate Data Regarding Potential Adverse Events From The Use Of These Treatments, Or From Potential Delays In Definitive Endoscopic Management. Caution Should Be Exercised When Using Any Conservative Management Strategies In These Patients. Plain Language Summary Use Of Treatments To Dislodge Soft Foods Stuck Between The Throat And The Stomach To Try To Avoid The Need For An Endoscopy Review Question Can A Period Of Observation, Treatment With Swallowed Substances, Or Treatment With Substances Given Via The Blood Help To Dislodge Soft Foods That Are Stuck Between The Throat And The Stomach In Order To Avoid The Need For An Endoscopic Procedure To Clear It? Background Food Can Sometimes Get Stuck In The Oesophagus, The Pipe Connecting The Throat To The Stomach That Passes Through The Chest. This Food Often Dislodges On Its Own, Without Any Medical Help, But Occasionally A Doctor'S Help Is Needed To Clear It. Removing Or Dislodging These Lumps Of Food Can Be Done Using A Flexible Camera Or A Rigid Instrument, Called An Endoscope, But Endoscopic Procedures Can Have Serious Complications, Like Causing Holes In The Oesophagus. However, Waiting For Too Long For The Food To Clear On Its Own Can Also Increase The Risk Of A Hole In The Oesophagus And May Lead To Saliva Or Food Falling Into The Lungs, Causing Serious Infections. A Variety Of Treatments Are Currently Used To Try To Clear The Food, Without Having To Resort To An Endoscopy, Many Of Which Also Have Potential Side Effects, Including Difficulty Breathing, Increased Blood Sugar Levels, Low Blood Pressure, And Irregular Heartbeat. We Wanted To Know If Any Of These Treatments Were Better Than Simply Waiting For The Food To Clear On Its Own, Before Trying To Dislodge It With Instruments. Study Characteristics The Evidence Is Current To August 2019. We Found One Trial Suitable To Answer Our Question, Which Compared Giving A Patient Two Drugs Into A Vein In (Diazepam And Glucagon) To Placebos (Clear Liquids Which Appeared Similar To The Drugs But Have No Effect On The Body). We Did Not Look At Treating Sharp Or Hard Objects, As These Are Treated Differently. Key Results There Was Not Enough Evidence To Say With Certainty Which Treatments For Food Impacted In The Oesophagus Are Safe Or Effective. Quality Of The Evidence We Graded The Overall Certainty Of The Evidence As Low. More Studies With More Participants Are Needed To Be Able To Answer The Review Question.

Treatment Depends On The Size And Kind Of  Foreign Bodies. When Complications Arise, Patients May Require Urgent Medical  Attention. Self-Harm By Sharp Foreign Body Ingestion Is A Rare Event That Must  Always Be Promptly Treated And Should Always Be Prevented. Psychiatric Patients  And Inmates Are The Most Affected Population. A High Index Of Suspicion Is  Required To Treat This Rare Condition, Which May Be Preventable If There Is  Adequate Mental And Medical Therapy Along With Close Monitoring And Family  Support. We Present The Case Of A 31-Year-Old Psychiatric Patient. After Prompt  Treatment, Two Razor Blades Were Surgically Removed From Her Intestines.

AB  - Purpose: Sharp-Pointed Fbs With Both Sides Embedded In The Duodenal Wall Are Rare. Compared With Smooth Edged Fbs, Sharp Objects Are More Likely To Be Associated With Significant Adverse Events, When Penetrating The Wall Of The Digestive Tract. The Clinical Features Of Patients Who Experienced Sharp-Pointed Fbs Embedded In Both Sides Of The Duodenum Were Retrospectively Analyzed, As Were The Efficacy And Safety Of Endoscopic Removal Of These Fbs. Patients And Methods: This Retrospective Study Included 21 Adults With Both Sides Of Sharp-Pointed Fbs Embedded Into The Duodenal Wall Who Were Admitted To The Second Xiangya Hospital In China Between January 1, 1996, And May 31, 2021. Data Associated With The Endoscopic Removal Of These Fbs Were Collected From The Electronic Medical Record System (Emrs) Of The Hospital. Results: The Incidence Rate Of Duodenal Total Fbs And Fbs Embedded In Both Sides Was 8.87% And 1.03%, Respectively. The Success Rate Of Endoscopic Treatment Was 100.00% In 124 Patients Without Embedded Duodenal Fbs And 97.14% In 35 Patients With One Side Embedded Duodenal Fbs. Of The 21 Patients With Fbs Embedded In Both Sides Of The Duodenal Wall, Endoscopic Removal Was Successful In 85.71% Of Patients, Whereas 14.29% Required Surgery. Fbs Removed From These Patients Included Toothpicks In 12; Needles In 3; Jujube Pits In 2; And A Chopstick, Dentures, Fish Bones, And Chicken Bones In One Each. Most Of These 21 Fbs Were Located In The Bulb And Descending Duodenum, Followed By The Third Part Of Duodenum. Conclusion: Sharp-Edged Fbs With Both Sides Embedded In The Duodenal Wall Are Rare. Endoscopic Removal May Be Considered As A Feasible, Safe, And Effective Method Of Removing Sharp-Pointed Fbs With Both Sides Embedded In The Duodenal Wall. And If Endoscopic Removal Is Unsuccessful, Surgical Management Can Be A Secondary Option.

AB  - Esophageal Emergencies Such As Rupture Or Postoperative Leak Are Uncommon But May Be Life Threatening When They Occur. Delay In Their Diagnosis And Treatment May  Significantly Increase Morbidity And Mortality. Causes Of Esophageal Injury  Include Iatrogenic (Including Esophagogastroduodenoscopy And Stent Placement),  Foreign Body Ingestion, Blunt Or Penetrating Trauma To The Chest Or Abdomen, And  Forceful Retching, Also Called Boerhaave Syndrome. Although Fluoroscopic  Esophagography Remains The Imaging Study Of Choice According The American College  Of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria, Ct Esophagography Has Been Shown To Be At  Least Equal To If Not Superior To Fluoroscopic Evaluation For Esophageal Injury.  In Addition, Ct Esophagography Allows Diagnosis Of Extraesophageal Abnormalities,  Both As The Cause Of The Patient'S Symptoms As Well As Incidental Findings. Ct  Esophagography Also Allows Rapid Diagnosis Since The Examination Can Be Readily  Performed In Most Clinical Settings And Requires No Direct Radiologist  Supervision, Requiring Only Properly Trained Technologists And A Ct Scanner.  Multiple Prior Studies Have Shown The Limited Utility Of Fluoroscopic  Esophagography After A Negative Chest Ct Scan And The Increase In Accuracy After  Adding Oral Contrast Agent To Ct Examinations, Although There Is Considerable  Variability Of Ct Esophagography Protocols Among Institutions. Development Of A  Ct Esophagography Program, Utilizing A Well-Defined Protocol With Input From  Staff From The Radiology, Gastroenterology, Emergency, And General Surgery  Departments, Can Facilitate More Rapid Diagnosis And Patient Care, Especially In  Overnight And Emergency Settings. The Purpose Of This Article Is To Familiarize  Radiologists With Ct Esophagography Techniques And Imaging Findings Of Emergent  Esophageal Conditions.

He Did Not Remember Swallowing A  Foreign Body, And His Oral Cavity Showed No Signs Of Inflammation.  Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography Showed A Low Density Area With Enhancement  In The Mediastinum, Especially Around The Esophageal Wall. We Planned To Perform  Surgical Drainage With The Intention Of Performing Intraoperative Endoscopy From  The Beginning. We Performed Surgical Drainage Through A Left Cervical Oblique  Incision; However, There Was No Exudate Obtained From The Mediastinal Space.  Despite The Reported Absence Of Accidental Ingestion Of A Foreign Substance,  Intraoperative Endoscopy Was Performed That Revealed A Laceration In The  Esophageal Mucosa 24 Cm From The Incisors. We Diagnosed It As A Submucosal  Abscess Of The Esophagus And Prescribed Parenteral Antibiotics. Submucosal  Abscess Of The Esophagus Can Occur Even In The Absence Of Awareness Of A Foreign  Body Ingestion Or Oral Infection. In Case That The Abscess Was Not Localized  Clearly Within The Outer Membrane Of The Esophagus, The Coincidental Mediastinal  Drainage Via A Cervical Incision And Intraoperative Endoscopy Seemed To Be  Useful.

The Purpose Of Our Study Was To Determine The Optimal Protocol  For Radiographic Survey Post-Coin Ingestion. We Hypothesized That For Children  Presenting With A Clear History Of Coin Ingestion A Frontal Chest Radiograph  Including The Entire Esophagus Is Adequate To Guide Treatment. Methods: We  Reviewed The Clinical History And Radiographic Surveys Of 134 Patients Presenting  With Suspected Or Witnessed Coin Ingestion To The Emergency Department Of A  Tertiary Care Pediatric Hospital Between January 2012 And June 2016. Patient  Demographics, Presenting Symptoms, Anatomic Coverage Of Survey, Type, Number And  Location Of Radiopaque Foreign Bodies, Intervention, And Follow-Up Were Recorded.  Results: Coins Were Identified On Radiographic Surveys In 109 Of 134 Patients; 25  Of 134 Patients Had No Coin. Of Those With Coins, None Of 109 Had Coin(S) In The  Airway, 42 Of 109 Had Coin(S) In The Esophagus, And 67 Of 109 Had Coin(S) Distal  To The Esophagus. Of Those With Esophageal Coins, 35 Of 42 Reported Symptoms, 7  Of 42 Were Asymptomatic, 40 Of 42 Underwent Endoscopic Coin Removal, And 2 Of 42  Had No Intervention. Of 92 Of 134 Surveyed Patients With No Coin Or Coin Distal  To The Esophagus, 30 Of 92 Reported Symptoms, 62 Of 92 Were Asymptomatic, 90 Of  92 Had No Further Intervention, And 2 Of 92 Eventually Underwent Endoscopic Coin  Removal For Specific Indications (Abdominal Pain, Delayed Passage). When There  Was No Coin Found In The Esophagus, The Negative Predictive Value For  Intervention Was 97.8%. Conclusions: Following A Clear History Of Coin Ingestion,  A Frontal Chest Radiograph Including The Entire Length Of The Esophagus Provides  Sufficient Information To Direct Patient Management.

During The Surgical Removal Of The Mass, A Hypodermic Needle Was Found Attached  To The Roof Of The Left Atrium Surrounded By Thrombotic And Fibrotic Tissue,  Which Was Confirmed By Pathology. Discussion: Cardiac Fbs Are Caused Generally By  Penetrating Wounds From Direct Trauma. Fewer Cases Have Been Reported Regarding  Cardiac Fb Caused By Ingestion From Migration Of The Object To The Heart. Signs  And Symptoms For Cardiac Fb May Mimic Those Of Cardiac Masses. Cardiac Fbs Often  Require Surgical Intervention To Avoid Complications.

Patients And Methods: A Retrospective Analysis Of Patients (N=1353)  Received Rigid Esophagoscopy For Foreign Body Extraction Under General Anesthesia  From January 2018 To 2020 December. Results: The Occurrence Of Efb Ingestion Was  Significantly Higher (P<0.05) On Holidays (2.75/Day) Than On Weekdays (0.91/Day)  And Weekends (1.46/Day). Patients Were Much Older On Holidays, With A Mean Age Of  58.18 ± 17.34 Years, Than Patients On Weekdays (54.71 ± 16.71 Years) And Weekends  (55.05 ± 17.36 Years). Conclusion: Our Findings Demonstrate That Efb Ingestion Is  Most Likely To Occur On Weekends And Holidays, And Elderly Patients Should Be  Advised To Chewing Slowly And Eating Non-Nuclear Jujube, Especially During  Holidays, To Minimize Their Risk.

Y1  - 2021
AU  - Yang, Liu
AU  - Li, Wen
JO  - World Journal Of Clinical Cases
AB  - Background: Foreign Body In The Deep Neck Is Mostly Associated With Accidental Ingestion Of The Animal Spiculate Bone Which Penetrates The Full-Thickness Of The  Aerodigestive Tract Into The Fascial Spaces Of The Neck. In General, Perforation  Of The Esophagus Often Results In Periesophagitis And Even Fatal Abscesses. The  Presence Of A Giant Foreign Body In The Neck Without Obvious Symptoms Or  Complications For Many Years Is Rare. Case Summary: We Present The Case Of A  32-Year-Old Man Who Intentionally Swallowed A Thermometer Which Was Unable To Be  Located By Endoscopy At His Initial Visit. He Had No Remarkable Symptoms For 5  Years Other Than Paresthesia And Limited Movement Of The Left Neck Until 7 D  Before This Admission. The Foreign Body Was Removed Successfully By The Surgery.  Conclusion: The Presence Of A Giant Foreign Body In The Neck Without Obvious  Symptoms Or Complications For Many Years Is Rare. Both Endoscopic And  Radiological Examinations Are Essential For The Diagnosis Of Alimentary Foreign  Bodies.

AB  - Introduction Foreign Body (Fb) Ingestion Either Accidental Or Intentional Is A Common Clinical Scenario Encountered By General Surgeons. This Article Reports A  Single Surgeon'S Experience Of Endoscopic Retrieval Of Foreign Bodies From The  Upper Gastrointestinal (Ugi) Tract. Methods A Retrospective Analysis Of Data Of  All The Patients Who Underwent Endoscopic Management For Foreign Body Removal By  A Single Surgeon In A Tertiary Care Hospital In Southern India Between 2015 And  2020 Was Conducted. Patient Variables In Terms Of Age, Sex, Type Of Foreign Body,  Its Location In The Gastrointestinal (Gi) Tract, The Time Between Ingestion And  Presentation, The Time Between Presentation And Endoscopy, Treatment Outcomes  Were Reviewed. Results A Total Of 97 Patients Were Studied. The Age Range Of The  Patients Studied Was One Month To 71 Years. Males Were Predominant (N=64,  65.97%). The Most Common Retrieved Foreign Body Were Coins (N=31, 31.9%). The  Most Common Site Of Foreign Body Lodgment Was The Esophagus (N=75, 77.31%), With  The Upper Third Esophagus (N=38; 39.37%) Being The Predominant Site. The Success  Rate Of Endoscopic Retrieval In Our Study Was 97%. No Procedure-Related  Complications Were Encountered In Any Patient. Endoscopic Management Failed In  Two Patients Who Ultimately Required Surgical Intervention. Conclusion Endoscopic  Retrieval Of Foreign Bodies In The Ugi Tract Is A Safe And Effective Modality.  Early Endoscopy In Such Patients Avoids Surgical Intervention And Reduces  Morbidity.

T1  - Intentional Foreign Body Ingestions: A Complex, Recurrent And Costly Issue
Y1  - 2021
AU  - Masood, Muaaz
JO  - American Journal Of Case Reports
AB  - Background Recurrent Intentional Foreign Body (Rifb) Ingestion Is A Complex And Costly Issue Among Patients In Prison And Those With Psychiatric Disorders. Risk  Factors For Rifb Ingestion Include Male Sex, Incarceration, And The Presence Of A  Psychiatric Disorder. Most Patients Can Be Managed With Observation And  Endoscopy. Surgery Is Indicated In Cases Involving Perforation Or Obstruction.  The Literature On Preventative Strategies For Rifb Ingestion Is Scarce. Case  Report A 23-Year-Old Man Required 6 Admissions In 1 Calendar Year For Intentional  Foreign Body Ingestions. The Patient Was Living In Prison And Had A History Of  Bipolar I Disorder, Schizophrenia, And Borderline Personality Disorder. He  Underwent 9 Endoscopic Procedures That Retrieved A Total Of 64 Objects. The  Primary Imaging Modalities Were Abdominal X-Ray And Abdominopelvic  Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography Scan. The Patient Was Managed With  Endoscopy And, In 2 Cases, With Observation Alone. Serial Abdominal Examinations  And Abdominal Films Were Used To Monitor The Progress Of Foreign Bodies That Were  Difficult To Retrieve. A Bowel Regimen With Polyethylene Glycol Facilitated The  Passage Of The Objects. The Patient Never Required Surgical Intervention. The  Mean Length Of Stay Was 4.17 Days. The Recurrent Ingestions May Have Been Related  To Compulsions And Family Stress. Conclusions Interdisciplinary Collaboration Is  Paramount In Formulating Effective Treatment Plans And Limiting Recurrence.  Proposed Strategies To Prevent Rifb Ingestion Include The Removal Of Ingestible  Objects From The Environment, Specialized Prison Units For Close Monitoring,  Early Psychiatric Intervention With Appropriate Pharmacologic/Behavioral Therapy,  And Limiting Hospital Admissions To Prevent Secondary Gain. Further Studies Are  Needed To Determine The Most Effective Approach To Manage And Prevent Rifb  Ingestion.

AB  - The Aim Of Our Article Is To Study The Incidence, Diagnosis, And Treatment Of Bowel Perforation By Foreign Body Ingestion. Bowel Perforation By Foreign Body Ingestion Has Been Believed To Be Relatively Rare, And Most Commonly Caused By Fish Bones, Chicken Bones, And Toothpicks. Our Clinical Experience, However, Suggests Such Perforations May Be More Common Than Previously Thought, And Caused By Various Other Objects As Well. Medical Records Of All Patients Diagnosed With Foreign Body-Induced Intestinal Perforation, From The Department Of General Surgery At Tonji Hospital, From January 2000 To June 2015, Were Retrospectively Analyzed. A Total Of 17 Men And 8 Women Suffered Intestinal Perforations By Ingestion Of Dietary Foreign Bodies. Among The 25 Total Patients, 4 Ingested Foreign Bodies Intentionally, Whereas The Other 21 Cases Were Accidental. The Foreign Bodies Were Identified By Plain X-Ray Film In 2 Patients (2 Cases Of Needles) And By Multidetector Computed Tomography (Mdct) In 11 Patients (6 Cases Of Date Stones, 3 Cases Of Metallic Objects, And 2 Cases Of Bone Fragments), Thus Supporting The Correct Preoperative Diagnosis (13 Cases; 52%). The Most Common Location Of The Perforation Was The Terminal Ileum (N = 17). The Offending Objects Were Date Stones (N = 13), Bones (N = 7), And Metallic Objects (N = 5). The Most Common Treatment Was Removal Of The Foreign Body And Closure Of The Perforation With Simple Suture (N = 22). Ten Patients Were Treated Laparoscopically. The Present Study Shows That The Most Common Foreign Bodies Causing Intestinal Perforation Are Date Stones And Bones. Although About 50% Of The Foreign Bodies Could Be Identified By Mdct, Definite Diagnosis Remained Preoperatively Difficult. Consequently, Because Of High Misdiagnosis Rates, Laparoscopy May Be The Optimal Choice For Diagnosis And Treatment Of Bowel Perforation By Foreign Bodies.

AB  - Purpose: The Purpose Of Our Study Was To Perform A Comparative Analysis Of The Examination And Treatment Outcomes Of Children With Cylindrical And Button  Batteries (Bb) Ingestion Depending On Their Size And Anatomical Locations.  Methods: This Study Was A Retrospective Analysis Of 124 Children Aged From  1 Month To 18 Years Who Ingested Batteries And Were Treated In A Tertiary Care  Center From January 1, 2014 To March 31, 2019. The Data Studied Included Age,  Sex, Presenting Symptoms At The Time Of Evaluation, Type And Size Of Battery And  Modality Of Management. Results: Twenty-Three (18.5%) Patients Ingested  Cylindrical Batteries (Cbs), And 101 (81.5%) Ingested Bbs. The Duration Of  Hospital Stay Was Significantly Longer (P = 0.004) In The Group Of Children Who  Ingested Bbs Larger Than 20 Mm. Endoscopic Removal Was Performed In 75 (60.5%)  Children, 46 (37.1%) Were Followed Up And Three (2.4%) Underwent Open Surgeries.  Children With Cbs Ingestion, In 55% Of Cases, Had Gastric Mucosal Injuries.  Children With Bbs Impacted In The Esophagus In 96% Cases Had Visible Severe  Mucosal Damage, Whereas Patients With Gastric Bb Ingestion 19.5% Had Superficial  Gastric Mucosal Damage. Conclusion: Performing Timely Endoscopic Retrieval In  Children Who Are Admitted Early To The Hospital Will Reduce The Risk Of Damage To  The Gastrointestinal Mucosa, Especially In The Stomach. Unlike Bbs, Cbs, Despite  Their Large Size, Have Advantageous Shapes, Uneventfully Pass The Esophagus And  Are More Often Retained In The Stomach; Thus, Mucosal Injuries Are More Often  Observed In The Stomach. Consequently, Endoscopic Extraction Is The Treatment Of  Choice For Children With Bb Ingestion.

AB  - Purpose: Foreign Body Ingestion Is Common In Children, And Most Foreign Bodies Pass Spontaneously Without Causing Serious Injuries. Ingestion Of Multiple  High-Power Magnet Pieces Is Unique And Increases The Risk Of Morbidity And  Mortality. The Longer The Duration Of Ingestion, The Increased Likelihood Of  Complications. Various Management Options Have Been Reported, And There Is No  Consensus On The Ideal Management Which Necessitates The Need For A Practical  Algorithm. The Incidence Of Magnet Ingestion Has Been Increasing And Directly  Related To The Laws And Recalls. The Aim Of This Review Is To Provide An Easy And  Practical Pathway For Management And To Highlight The Preventive Rules Of The  Legislations And Recalls. Methods: Pubmed/Medline, The Cochrane Database Of  Systematic Reviews, And The List Of References From All Identified Complete  Publications Were Searched For All Publications In English-Language For Pediatric  Magnet Ingestion. Conclusion: Practical And Time-Saving Management Pathways Are  Recommended To Minimize The Risk Of Complications. Preventive Rules And Recalls  Are Important For Eliminating The Availability Of These Hazardous Magnets. Public  Awareness About The Unique Risks Posed By These Magnets If Ingested Is Important.

AB  - Purpose: Foreign Body (Fb) Ingestions Represent A Common Problem In Children. History And Physical Examination Are Commonly Not Enough To Diagnose A Foreign  Body Ingestion; Therefore, Conventional Radiography Is Routinely Used To Detect  Them. Point-Of-Care Ultrasound Is Widely Used In The Emergency Department For  Several Diagnostic Applications But There Are Few Articles Describing The  Possibility To Use Point-Of-Care Ultrasound To Detect Ingested Foreign Bodies,  And The Necessary Training To Get Competent In This Application. The Main  Objective Of This Paper Is To Illustrate The Use Of Point-Of-Care Ultrasound  (Pocus) To Detect Ingested Foreign Bodies. The Secondary Objective Is To Describe  A Limited Training, Necessary For Emergency Pediatricians, To Obtain This Skill.  Methods: This Is A Case Series Of Eight Pediatric Patients Who Presented To The  Pediatric Emergency Department (Ed), With Suspected Ingestion Of Fb, And Were  Assessed With Pocus. Physician Sonographers Were Two Pediatricians And Three  Residents In Pediatrics Working In Two Italian Pediatric Eds. All Sonographers  Participated In A 2-Day Pocus Workshop Which Included The Most Common Pediatric  Pocus Applications. Results: Pocus, Performed By Emergency Pediatricians Who  Participated To A Limited Training, Allowed To Always Identify The Foreign Bodies  Ingested. Conclusions: We Demonstrate That An Appropriate And Limited Training  Allows Pediatric Emergency Physicians To Correctly Identify Foreign Body In The  Esophagus Or Stomach. Point-Of-Care Ultrasound In Foreign Body Ingestion In The  Emergency Department May Allow To Prioritize The Escalation Of Care In Children  And It Can Contribute To Reduce The Time To Endoscopic Management When Needed.

AB  - Ingestion Of Food By-Products, Such As Peach Pits, Chicken Bones And Fish Bones, May Lead To Intestinal Complications. The Ingestion Of The Foreign Body Is Often  Acute And Non-Intentional. Acute And Life-Threatening Complications Include  Intestinal Perforation Or Obstruction. Sharp-Pointed Objects Are Associated With  An Estimated 35% Rate Of Complications Within The Gastrointestinal Tract Prior To  Passage And Require Prompt Removal. Endoscopic Retrieval Is Often Recommended If  Foreign Objects Have Not Transited Beyond The Proximal Duodenum. We Present A  Unique Case Of A Previously Healthy 23-Year-Old Male Suffering Months Of  Abdominal Pain. While The Initial Presentation And Imaging Were Suspicious For  Crohn'S Disease, The Endoscopic Findings Were Unexpected. Numerous Chicken Bone  Fragments Were Clustered In The Caecum And In The Terminal Ileum. The Distal  Terminal Ileum Was Edematous And Ulcerated. Subsequent Patient History Revealed  Years Of Chronic And Intentional Foreign Body Consumption With Recent Onset Of  Abdominal Pain.

The Aim Was To Assess The Impact On Services And To Identify Ways To Safely  Mitigate Against This Clinical Challenge. Design/Method: We Performed A  Retrospective Observational Study Of All Patients Presenting To A University  Hospital Between January 2015 And April 2020 With Ifobi With A Focus On Objects  Swallowed, Timing Of Endoscopy And Clinical Outcomes. Results: 239 Episodes Of  Ifobi In 51 Individuals Were Recorded With A Significant Increase In Incidence  Throughout The Study Period (Welch (5, 17.3)=15.1, P<0.001), Imposing A High  Burden On Staff And Resources. Items Lodged In The Oesophagus Were More Likely To  Lead To Mucosal Injury (P=0.009) Compared With Elsewhere. Ingested Item Type And  Timing Of Endoscopy Were Not Related To Complications (P=0.78) Or Length Of Stay  (P=0.8). In 12% Of Cases, No Objects Were Seen At Endoscopy. Conclusion: In All  Except Those Patients With Oesophageal Impaction Of The Object On Radiograph,  There Is No Need To Perform Endoscopic Extraction Out Of Hours. A Subset Of Cases  Can Avoid Endoscopy With An X-Ray Immediately Prior To The Procedure As A  Significant Proportion Have Passed Already. We Discuss More Holistic Approaches  To Deal With Recurrent Attendances.

JO  - Journal Of Dental Education
AB  - Purpose/Objectives: The Frequency Of Medical Emergencies In A Dental Setting Is Relatively Low. However, Most Dental Treatment Occurs Outside Of A Hospital  Setting; Thus The Time To Respond To A Life-Threatening Situation Is Crucial. The  Aim Of This Study Was To Determine The Frequency And Characteristics Of Medical  Emergencies That Occurred At The Griffith University Dental Clinic Over A 6-Year  Period. Methods: Data Involving Medical Emergencies Was Collected At A Dental  School Between January 2014 And December 2019. Data Was Obtained From The Risk  Incident Reporting System (Gsafe), And Descriptive Statistics Were Analyzed Using  Ibm Spss. Results: The Frequency Of Medical Emergencies In A Dental Setting Over  The 6-Year Retrospective Period Based On The Number Of Dental Services Provided  Was 0.037% (N = 108). The Three Most Common Medical Emergencies Were Syncope  (25.0%), Hypoglycemia (16.7%), And Foreign Body Ingestion (13.9%). These Happened  More Often During Dental Extractions (26.9%), Followed By Local Anesthesia  (16.7%) And Restorative Procedures (13.0%). A Larger Portion Of These Incidents  Occurred During Dental Treatment (62.0%) As Opposed To Before (12.0%) Or After  (26.0%). Most Medical Emergencies Happened Within The Dental Student Clinic  (72.2%) Followed By The Dental Waiting Room (19.5%) And Dental Private Clinic  (8.3%). Conclusion: Overall, The Number Of Medical Emergencies At The Griffith  University Dental Clinic Was Low. The Most Common Medical Emergencies Were  Syncope, Hypoglycemia, And Foreign Body Ingestion. Dental Education In  Preventative Strategies And Training In Basic Life Support Is Necessary To Ensure  Dental Practitioners Can Manage The Acute Deterioration Of A Patient Promptly.

AB  - A 32-Year-Old Female With A History Of Bipolar Disorder And Schizophrenia Was Transported To Our Tertiary-Care Hospital After Swallowing A Large Toilet Paper  Holder Bracket. Removal Of The Large Foreign Body Required Coordination Between  Anesthesiology, Otolaryngology, And Trauma Surgery. A Tracheostomy Airway Was  Established, And The Object Was Removed Transorally. The Object Was Found To Be A  Toilet Paper Holder Bracket Measuring 7.5 Cm × 5.4 Cm × 5.4 Cm With A 2.6 Cm  Screw Protruding From The End. A Review Of Articles Describing The Removal Of  Foreign Bodies From The Upper Aerodigestive Tract Found Our Object To Be The  Largest Foreign Body Ingestion Described In Literature. One Report Suggested That  18% Of Adult Patients With Foreign Body Ingestions Had Primary Neuropsychiatric  Disorders. Our Patient'S Psychiatric Disorder Was A Major Underlying Factor  Leading To The Ingestion, With Our Patient Reporting Hallucinations Instructing  Her To Ingest Household Objects.

JO  - International Journal Of Surgery Case Reports
AB  - Introduction And Importance: Endoscopic Foreign Body Retrieval In The Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Is Well Established, However Indications For Endoscopy For  Retained Foreign Bodies In The Lower Gastrointestinal Tract And Specifically The  Right Colon Is Still Being Navigated [3]. A Pubmed And Google Scholar Search  Discovered A Variety Of Case Reports Detailing Various Methods And Indications  For Endoscopic Retrieval Of Right Sided Colonic Foreign Bodies. This Case Report  Endeavors To Supplement The Literature So That Guidelines Can One Day Be  Established For Colonoscopic Retrieval Of Right-Sided Foreign Bodies. Case  Presentation: 36-Year-Old Male Prisoner Swallowed 6.5 Cm Nail Clippers With A  Long-Standing History Of Intentional Foreign Body Ingestion (Fbi) Including  Multiple Laparotomies For Foreign Body Retrievals. Computerized Tomography (Ct)  Was Used Initially To Confirm The Position Of The Nail Clippers. After Almost Two  Weeks Of Failure Of The Foreign Body (Fb) To Move Beyond The Caecum As  Demonstrated On Plain Abdominal X-Rays, The Patient Had A Colonoscopy With  Successful Retrieval Of The Fb. Clinical Discussion: This Case Report Hopes To  Encourage The Consideration Of Colonoscopy For Retrieval Of Right Sided Colonic  Foreign Bodies That Have Failed To Pass On Their Own And Where An Operation May  Come With Increased Risk (Multiple Laparotomies, Multiple Comorbidities, And  Higher Anaesthetic Risk For A General Anaesthetic). Colonoscopy/Endoscopy Still  Has Inherent Risk And This Patient Did Have An Episode Of Temporary Laryngospasm  That Required Intubation And Monitoring In The Intensive Care Unit Post  Operatively. Despite This The Patient Recovered And Was Discharged Day One Post  Procedure Without Further Complication. The Case Report Has Been Reported In Line  With The Scare 2020 Criteria (Agha Et Al., 2020 [2]). Conclusion: Indications For  Consideration Of Endoscopic Retrieval Of Foreign Bodies In The Right Colon Have  Not Been Entirely Detailed As Endoscopy Is For Upper Gastrointestinal Foreign  Bodies. This Case Report Documents The Indications For Endoscopy In The Clinical  Context Of A Recurrent Fbi And A History Of Multiple Laparotomies With Failure Of  The Fb To Move Beyond The Caecum.

Methods:  Retrospective Study, Included All Patients Undergoing Re Or Fe For Impacted Ugit  Foreign Body Over An 11-Year-Period. Results: A Total Of 144 Patients Were  Included (95 Fe And 49 Re). Fe Were Performed Under Local Anaesthetic Or  Sedation, And Re Under Ga. Success Rate Of Fe And Re Were 95.8% And 95.9%  Respectively. During Fe An Intra-Procedural Biopsy Was Performed In 45/95  (47.3%); With 26/95(27.4%) Identifying Mucosal Pathology. Complications Was  Significantly Higher In Patients Having Re (40.8% Versus 6.3%, P = .001).  Conclusion: Fe And Re Are Effective For The Therapeutic Management Of Impacted  Ugit Foreign Bodies. However, Fe Can Be Performed Under La And Was Associated  With Fewer Complications, Favouring Fe Where Possible As A First Line Option.

Factors Influencing Morbidity And Mortality Among Studied Patients Will Be Deliberated As Well. Methods It Is A Hospital-Based Descriptive Study Where All Children Between Birth And 16 Years Of Age Who Were Admitted To Sohag University Hospital, Egypt From January 1St, 2018, To December 31St, 2020, For Fbs Removal Were Analyzed. All Cases Were Subjected To Complete History Taking, Physical, Radiological, And Bronchoscopic Examination. Results A Total Of Fourteen [14] Patients Were Presented With Fbi Based On A Full History, Examination, And Essential Investigation. The Vast Majority 92.9% Of Presented Cases (13 Out Of 14) Were Less Than 6 Years Old. 50% Of Them (50%) (7 Out Of 14) Were Less Than One Year Old. Most Cases Presented Early Within A Few Hours After Ingestion (71.4%). Two [2] Patients Had Predisposing Conditions Like Mental Retardation And Cerebral Palsy. 28.6% Of Cases Presented Late (> 24 H After Aspiration). Except For One Case Where A Cervical Oesophageal Approach Was Needed. Endoscopic Extractions Of Foreign Bodies Were Successfully Done. 50% Of Patients Required Admissions To The Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (Picu). The Mortality Rate Was 14.3%. Conclusion Fbi Is A Common Clinical Emergency In Children Younger Than 6 Years. A High Index Of Suspicion Is The Keystone For Diagnosis. Early Detection And Management Are Crucial For A Positive Outcome.

AB  - Purpose: Institutions Are Adopting The North American Society For Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology And Nutrition (Naspghan) Guidelines For Pediatric  Esophageal Button Battery Ingestion (Ebbi). Our Objective Was To Evaluate The  Guidelines' Impact On In-Hospital Resource Utilization And Short-Term Clinical  Outcomes In Hemodynamically Stable Patients After Endoscopic Battery Removal.  Methods: A Single-Center Retrospective Review Of All Ebbi Admissions From 2010 To  2020. Patients Were Divided Into Two Groups Based On Adoption Of National  Guidelines: Pre-Guideline (2010-2015) And Post-Guideline (2016-2020). Results:  Sixty-Five Patients Were Studied (Pre-Guideline N = 23; Post-Guideline N = 42).  Compared With Pre-Guideline, Post-Guideline Use Of Magnetic Resonance Imaging  (Mri) Increased (2/23 [8.7%]; 30/42 [71.4%]; P < 0.001). Post-Guideline Increases  Resulted For Median Days (Iqr) Receiving Antibiotics (0 [0, 4]; 6 [3, 8];  P = 0.01), Total Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Admission (0 [0, 1]; 3 [0, 6];  P < 0.001), And Total Hospital Length Of Stay (5 [2, 11]; 11.5 [4, 17];  P = 0.02). Two Patients In The Post-Guideline Group Had Delayed Presentations  Despite Normal Imaging: One With Tef And One With Aorto-Esophageal Fistula. All  Survived To Discharge. Conclusion: In Ebbi Cases Managed Using The Consensus  Based Nasphagn Guidelines, We Report Increased Resource Utilization Without  Improved Patient Outcomes. Further Research Should Evaluate Post-Guideline Costs  And Resource Utilization.

AB  - Background: Foreign Body (Fb) Ingestion Is A Common Condition. Mostly Fbs Are Found Ingested Accidently Or Intentionally In Children And Adults With Mental  Status Alterations. Depending On The Type Of Object, Different Complications Can  Occur. There Exist Numerous Methods For Removing Each Specific Fb. Fortunately,  Most Fbs Tend To Move Uneventfully Through The Gastrointestinal Tract Without Any  Intervention; But Managing Some Foreign Objects Can Be Difficult And Lead To  Severe Complications. Endoscopy Helps With The Diagnosis And Treatment Of These  Cases, But The Time Of The Management Plays An Important Role. Case Presentation:  A 26-Year-Old Female Who Intentionally Swallowed Two Sewing Needles, Presented To  Our Emergency Department With Abdominal Pain Two Months After The Fb Ingestion.  One Of The Sewing Needles Was Spontaneously Excreted Through The Bowel, And The  Other Was Present In Her Body For Two Months. The Fb Had Penetrated The Stomach  And Migrated To The Peritoneal Cavity. The Patient'S Condition Was Managed By  Laparoscopic Removal Of The Fb And Repair Of The Damaged Tissue. According To The  Traumatic Nature Of The Needle To Abdominal Viscera, And Standing Outside The Gi  Tract On The Pancreas Surface, Laparoscopic Removal Of The Foreign Metallic Body  Was Chosen To Be Performed. No Complication Was Seen During The Postoperative  Period. Conclusion: This Report Emphasizes The Importance Of Prompt Evaluation Of  Fb Patients And Finding The Appropriate Method Of Managing Its Complications.  Preventing Complications Requires Focusing On Symptoms And Instant Management Of  The Ingested Fbs.

AB  - Introduction: Intentional And Accidental Foreign Body Ingestion Are Commonly Encountered In Clinical Practice. In Adults, Intentional Foreign Body Ingestion  Is Frequently Observed Among Individuals With Psychiatric Disorders And  Prisoners. Controversies Exist Regarding The Management Of Sharp Or Pointed  Objects. We Contribute To This Existing Controversy By Presenting A Case Of A  43-Year-Old Male Who Accidently Ingested A Metallic Screw And Was Managed  Successfully Through Endoscopic Retrieval. Case Presentation: We Discuss A Case  Of A 43-Year-Old Male Presented To Our Emergency Department After Accidently  Swallowing A Metallic Screw, 1 H And A Half Prior To His Presentation. He Was  Initially Asymptomatic Then Started To Complain Of Vague Abdominal Symptoms.  X-Rays Of The Chest And Abdomen Demonstrated The Presence Of A Metallic Screw At  The Mid-Abdomen. Computed Tomography Scan Of The Abdomen Then Confirmed Its  Presence Within The Gastric Lumen, With No Evidence Of Gastric Or Bowel  Perforation. The Patient Was Managed Via Esophagogastroduodenoscopy In Which The  Ingested Screw Was Extracted. He Was Discharged After 24 Hours In A Good  Condition. Clinical Discussion: A Limited Number Of Epidemiological Studies Have  Shed Light On The Prevalence And Incidence Of Foreign Body Ingestion Among Adult  Individuals. Probability Of Spontaneous Passage Depends On Several Factors  Including The Size, Shape And Composition Of The Impacted Item, As Well As The  Age Of Patient And Duration Of Ingestion Prior To Presentation. Conclusion:  Considering The Variation Of Ingested Objects And The Availability Of Several  Therapeutic Approaches, A Patient-Tailored Management Plan Should Always Be  Established.

JO  - Emergency Radiology
AB  - Purpose: Ingestion Of A Toothbrush Is An Unusual Event But May Occur Either Accident Or By Intent. Radiological Examinations Play A Crucial Role In  Determining The Exact Location Of The Object Within The Gastrointestinal Tract  And In Planning For Its Removal By Endoscopic Or Surgical Intervention. Methods:  Medical And Radiological Records Of 8 Patients Who Had Swallowed The Broken Heads  Or Entire Toothbrush Were Retrospectively Reviewed. This Series Included 4 Men  And 4 Women, Ranging In Age From 21 To 57 Years (Mean: 34 Years). Results:  Radiographs And Computed Tomography Of The Abdomen Demonstrated The Ingested  Toothbrushes Within The Stomach In 3, Lodged In The Duodenum In 1, And Entrapped  In Various Parts Of The Colon In 4 Patients. They Were Removed By Laparotomy In  3, Laparoscopy In 2, Colonoscopy In 2, And Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy In 1  Patient. There Were No Perforations Or Associated Complications, And All Patients  Had Uneventful Recoveries. Conclusions: Ingested Toothbrushes Can Be Easily  Identified On Radiological Studies Because Of The Radiopaque Wires Holding The  Nylon Bristles. The Plastic Parts Of It, However, Are Only Visible On Computed  Tomography. All Cases Would Require Endoscopic Or Surgical Removal Of The  Retained Toothbrushes Because Spontaneous Passage Per Rectum Does Not Occur.

AB  - Purpose The Incidence Of Lithium Button Battery Ingestion Has Been Increasing Recently, Which Results In Severe Complications. We Aimed To Demonstrate The Association Between The Corrosion Of Lithium Button Batteries In The Esophagus On Radiographs And Their Complications. Methods The Nine Pediatric Patients Included In This Study Were Classified Into Two Groups Based On The Presence Of Severe Complications. The Presence And Degree Of Corrosion On Plain Radiographs Were Evaluated. The Degree Of Corrosion Was Classified Into The Following Three Grades; None: 0%; Moderate: 1-50%; Severe: 51-100%. Fisher'S Exact Test Was Used For Statistical Analyses. Results Of The Nine Patients, Five Showed Complications. The Number Of Patients Who Had Grade None, Moderate, And Severe Degrees Of Corrosion Was Three, Four, And Two, Respectively. The Incidence Of Severe Complications Differed Significantly Between The Incidence Of Lithium Button Batteries' Contour (Without Vs. With Severe Complications [Presence/Absence Of Corrosion] = 1/3 Vs. 5/0, Respectively; P = 0.0476). In Cases With None Degree Of Corrosion, All Three Cases Had No Complication, And In Cases With A Severe Degree Of Corrosion, All Two Cases Had Complications. Conclusion The Cases With The Presence Of Corrosion Of Lithium Button Batteries Had A Higher Tendency To Have Severe Complications. Therefore, Physicians Should Anticipate The Presence Of Severe Complications In Pediatric Patients With Corrosion More Than Those Without Corrosion.

AB  - Background And Aims: Endoscopic Procedures For Foreign Body Ingestion (Fbi) And Esophageal Food Impactions (Efi) Performed During On-Call Hours Are Associated  With Increased Stress, Risk, And Cost. We Implemented A Foreign Body Algorithm  (Fba) Designed To Delay All But The Most Urgent Endoscopy For Efi And Fbi Until  Regular Working Hours. Methods: Using Endoscopy Records From Multiple Academic  And Community Hospitals Within A Large Integrated Health System In The United  States, We Identified Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (Egd) Performed For Food  Impactions And Foreign Body Ingestions Occurring Between May 2011 And February  2021. Results: We Identified 479 Egds Performed For Fbi And Efi. The Introduction  Of The Fba Was Associated With A Shorter Length Of Stay (Los) For Overall Cases  (0.35 Vs. 0.8 D P <0.001), Day Cases (0.16 Vs. 1.0 D P <0.001), And Night Cases  (0.40 Vs. 0.6 D P =0.03). The Introduction Of The Fba Did Not Change The Rate Of  Overall Adverse Events (Ae) Or Night Ae. Ae From The Entire Cohort Was Rare (3%;  16 Total). Of The Ae, Most Were Sedation Related. The Introduction Of The Fba Did  Not Affect The Overall Rate Of Night Cases Or Ae, But The Rate Of After-Hours  Endoscopy For Intentional Ingestions Decreased From 17.2% To 3.1% ( P =0.01).  Conclusion: This Is One Of The Largest Studies Of Esophageal Impactions And  Foreign Bodies In Adults In The United States, And The First To Examine The  Effects Of A Protocol Designed To Avoid After-Hours Endoscopy. These Results  Suggest That Postponing After-Hours Egd Until The Daytime Is Not Associated With  Adverse Safety Outcomes Or Increased Los.

JO  - Current Opinion In Pediatrics
AB  - Purpose Of Review: Pediatric Button Battery And Cannabis Ingestions Are Rising In Incidence And Have The Potential For Significant Harm. This Review Will Focus On  The Clinical Presentation And Complications Of These Two Common Inadvertent  Ingestions In Children, As Well As Recent Regulatory Efforts And Advocacy  Opportunities. Recent Findings: The Rising Incidence Of Cannabis Toxicity In  Children Has Corresponded With Its Legalization Across Several Countries In The  Last Decade. Inadvertent Pediatric Cannabis Intoxication Is Most Commonly Due To  The Ingestion Of Edible Forms Discovered By Children In Their Own Home. The  Clinical Presentation Can Be Nonspecific, Therefore Clinicians Should Have A Low  Threshold For Including It On Their Differential Diagnosis. Button Battery  Ingestions Are Also Increasing In Incidence. While Many Children Are Asymptomatic  At Presentation, Button Battery Ingestions Can Quickly Cause Esophageal Injury  And Lead To Several Serious And Potentially Life-Threatening Complications.  Prompt Recognition And Removal Of Esophageal Button Batteries Is Essential For  Reducing Harm. Summary: Cannabis And Button Battery Ingestions Are Important For  Physicians Who Take Care Of Children To Recognize And Manage Appropriately. Given  Their Rising Incidence, There Are Many Opportunities For Policy Improvements And  Advocacy Efforts To Make A Difference In Preventing These Ingestions Altogether.

AB  - Background And Study Aims Foreign Body Ingestion Is A Common Cause For Emergency Department Presentation. In Adults, Foreign Body Ingestion Is More Common In  Patients With Underlying Psychiatric Comorbidity, The Elderly, Alcohol  Intoxication, And In Prisoners. This Study Reviewed The Management Of Patients  Presenting To A Tertiary Hospital With Foreign Body Ingestion. Patients And  Methods A Retrospective Review Of Patients Presenting With Foreign Body Ingestion  To A Tertiary Hospital In Melbourne, Victoria, Was Undertaken From January 2017  To December 2021. Data Collected Included Patient Demographics, Type Of Foreign  Body, Length Of Stay, Imaging Modalities, Management Strategies, And  Complications. High-Risk Ingestion Was Defined As Sharp Objects, Length >5 Cm,  Diameter >2.5 Cm, Button Battery And/Or Magnet Ingestion Or Esophageal As Per  International Guidelines. Results A Total Of 157 Presentations By 63 Patients  With Foreign Body Ingestion Occurred Between 2017 And 2021 (50% Male; Median Age  30 Years). Of The Patients, 56% Had Underlying Psychiatric Comorbidities. The  Majority Of Presentations Occurred In Prisoners (65%). The Most Commonly Ingested  Objects Were Batteries (23%), Alleged Drug-Containing Balloons (17%), Razor  Blades (16%), And Miscellaneous (40%). High-Risk Ingestion Occurred In  Approximately Two-Thirds Of Presentations. Conservative Management Was The Most  Common Approach In 55% Of Patients. Complications, Defined As Perforation, Bowel  Obstruction Or Fistula Formation, Did Not Occur In This Cohort Despite More Than  Half Presenting With High-Risk Ingestions. Thirty-Day Re-Presentation Rates Were  High (31%) And That Was Most Common In Patients With Intentional Ingestion,  Underlying Mental Health Disorders, And A Documented History Of Self-Harm.  Conclusions Conservative Management For Patients Presenting With Recurrent  High-Risk Foreign Body Ingestion Was Safe In Appropriately Selected Cases.  Re-Presentation Is Common And Poses Significant Challenges For Health Care  Providers.

Methods: The Medical Record Was Queried For All Patients Under 21 Years  Old Evaluated At Our Institution For Button Battery Ingestion From 2008 To 2021.  A Severe Outcome Was Defined As Having At Least One Of The Following:  Deep/Circumferential Mucosal Erosion, Perforation, Mediastinitis, Vascular Or  Airway Injury/Fistula, Or Development Of Esophageal Stricture. From A Selection  Of Clinically Relevant Factors, Logistic Regression Determined Predictors Of A  Severe Outcome, Which Were Incorporated Into A Risk Model. Results: 143 Patients  Evaluated For Button Battery Ingestion Were Analyzed. 24 (17%) Had A Severe  Outcome. The Independent Predictors Of A Severe Outcome In Multivariate Analysis  Were Location Of Battery In The Esophagus On Imaging (96%), Battery Size  >/ = 2 Cm (95%), And Presence Of Any Symptoms On Presentation (96%), With  P < 0.001 In All Cases. Predicted Probability Of A Severe Outcome Ranged From 88%  When All Three Risk Factors Were Observed, To 0.3% When None Were Present.  Conclusion: We Report The Presentation, Management, And Complication Profiles Of  A Large Cohort Of Bb Ingestions Treated At A Single Institution. A Risk Score To  Predict Severe Outcomes May Be Used By Providers Initially Evaluating Patients  With Button Battery Ingestion In Order To Allocate Resources And Expedite  Transfer To A Center With Pediatric Endoscopic And Surgical Capabilities.

AB  - Esophageal Perforations And Postoperative Leaks Are Challenging And Life -Threatening Conditions, With A Not Well-Defined Management, Yet. Perforation Is Defined As A Full -Thickness Tear In The Esophageal Wall Due To A Trauma On The Esophageal Lumen Or To A Sudden Increase Of Endoluminal Pressure, Like In Spontaneous Perforations. The Most Frequent Causes Are: Iatrogenic Injuries, Spontaneous Perforations, Foreign Body Or Caustic Ingestion, Trauma, Tumors Etc. The Onset Of Symptoms Varies Depending On The Location Of Perforation (Cervical, Intrathoracic Or Intraabdominal), The Degree Of Tissue Destruction And Extension Of Contamination Of Surrounding Organs, The Cause, The Timing Of Diagnosis And The Presence Of Underlying Esophageal Disorders. Post -Operative Esophageal Leaks Have A Different Origin But A Quite Similar Clinical Presentation And Treatment To Esophageal Perforations. The Higher Reported Incidence Is After Cervical Esophagogastric Anastomosis, Followed By Intrathoracic Anastomosis (Above All After Trans-Hiatal One). It Is Already Proven That Short Diagnostic Timing And Correct Treatment Can Reduce Mortality Of 50%. Recent Evidence Also Shows How Better Outcomes Are Achieved When The Management Is Multidisciplinary, Led By An Expert Team, And Individualized Treatments Are Adopted, Involving All Available Modalities (Medical, Endoscopic And Surgical). The Purpose Of This Article Is To Review Current Standard Practice, Expert Opinions And Outcomes In The Management Of Esophageal Perforations And Postoperative Leaks.

JO  - Pediatric Emergency Care
AB  - Purpose: Foreign Body Ingestion (Fbi) Is A Frequent Concern In Emergency Departments. Clinical Guidelines Recommend Performing Plain X-Rays As The Primary  Modality Of Diagnosis. Although Point-Of-Care Ultrasound (Pocus) Has Increasingly  Been Integrated Into The Daily Practice Of Emergency Medicine, It Has Been Poorly  Investigated In The Diagnostic Approach For Fbi.This Review Aims To Highlight The  Current State Of Pocus Use For Pediatric Fbi.The Following Research Question Was  Considered In This Narrative Review: Is Pocus Useful For Fbi Management? Methods:  A Literature Search Was Conducted To Identify Articles Reporting Pocus Use For  The Management Of Fbi. All Articles Were Assessed For Quality By 2 Reviewers.  Main Results: The 14 Selected Articles Reported 52 Fbi Cases In Which Pocus  Successfully Identified And Located The Ingested Fb. Point-Of-Care Ultrasound Was  Used Either As The Primary Imaging Technique Or After Positive Or Negative X-Ray  Findings. In 5 Cases (9.6%), Pocus Was The Only Modality Used For The Diagnosis.  Of These Cases, 3 (60%) Underwent A Successful Procedure To Remove The Fb And 2  (40%) Received Conservative Treatment Without Complications. Conclusions: This  Review Suggests That Pocus Might Be A Reliable Modality For The Initial  Management Of Fbi. Pocus Can Locate, Identify, And Evaluate The Size Of The Fb In  A Wide Range Of Materials And Gastrointestinal Locations. Point-Of-Care  Ultrasound Could Eventually Become The Go-To Modality In The Case Of Radiolucent  Fb, Thus Avoiding The Use Of Radiation. Further Studies Are Nevertheless Required  To Validate Pocus Use For Fbi Management.

JO  - Pediatric Surgery International
AB  - Purpose: Foreign Body (Fb) Ingestion In Children Has Varied Presentation. When Unwitnessed, It Poses Therapeutic And Diagnostic Challenges Especially In The  Presence Of Pre-Existing Anatomical Pathology. We Aim To Analyze The Clinical  Course, Management, And Outcome Of Children With Impacted Esophageal Fbs.  Methods: Retrospective Chart Review (Jan 2000-Feb 2018) Recruiting Children With  Impacted Esophageal Fbs. Fbs In Cricopharynx And Those That Moved To Stomach Were  Excluded. Investigations/Management Were Based On Underlying Anatomical  Pathology, Duration Of Impaction, And Difficult Fbs. Clinical Details,  Management, And Outcomes Were Collated. Results: Of 86 Children, N1 = 31 Had  Identifiable Predisposing Anatomic Pathology And N2 = 55 Had Impactions In Normal  Esophagus Or Difficult Fbs. N1 Group Presented Early (42 Months), Had Recurrent  Impactions (1-6), And Needed Multiple Dilatations (0-8) And Longer Follow-Up (Avg  35 Months). Food Matter Was Commonest Impaction. Many Had Persistent Symptoms. N2  Group Had Commonly Coin Impactions And Strictures Developed In Long Standing Or  Corrosive Fbs. Most Were Asymptomatic. Conclusion: Abnormal Esophageal Anatomy  Predisposes To Impaction With Organic Food Bolus. Age Of Presentation Is Earlier  With Recurrent Impactions Requiring Multiple Dilatations/Surgery And Longer  Follow-Up. Metallic Fbs Commonly Impact In Normal Esophagus And Are Often  Innocuous. Atypical/Multiple Fbs May Mirror An Underlying Psychiatric Illness.

AB  - Introduction And Importance: Foreign Body (Fb) Ingestion And Its Complications Are Abundant In Emergency Departments. This Potentially Severe Problem Had A Peak  Incidence In Children Aged 6 Months To 6 Years. Intentional Adult Cases Are  Voluntary And More Common In Prisoners And People With Psychiatric Problems.  However, Most Patients (90%) Remain Asymptomatic, And These Pass Through The Body  Spontaneously. Case Presentation: The Authors Report A Case Of Surgically  Removing Plenteous Sharp-Pointed Metallic Foreign Bodies Ingested By A Young Male  Deaf-Mute Bipolar Schizoaffective Patient From His Stomach, Intestine, And  Rectum. Furthermore, The Authors Have Reviewed The Available Literature For  Similar Cases. Clinical Discussion: Less Than 1% Of Patients Need Surgical  Removal, 10-20% Need To Be Taken Out Endoscopically, And The Remaining Pass  Spontaneously. Plain Radiography Is The Most Available Imaging Modality Detecting  The Number, Material, And Estimated Place Of The Alimentary Canal Trapped.  Conclusion: For The Risk Of Perforation, Migration, And Peritonitis, Surgery Is  Indicated In Such Situations.

JO  - Turkish Journal Of Gastroenterology
AB  - Background/Aims: Intentional Ingestion Of Foreign Bodies Is A Frequent Occurrence In The Prison Environment. The Aim Of This Study Is To Describe The Profile Of Inmates Who Have Ingested Foreign Bodies, To Determine The Nature Of These Foreign Bodies And To Specify Their Management. Materials And Methods: Our Retrospective And Descriptive Study Focused' On 13 Inmates Having Ingested' 47 Foreign Bodies And Who Consulted The Emergency Of Our Department Over A 5-Year Period From January 2018 To July 2023. Results: The Study Population Consisted Of 12 Men And One Woman With An Average Age Of 32 Years (24 Years-47 Years). Foreign Bodies Ingested By Inmates Were Dominated By Batteries (59.52%) Followed By Lighters (19.04%). The Majoritý Of Foreign Bodies Were, At The Time Of Discovery, Located Mainly In The Stomach (6 Cases) And Colon (4 Cases). Ingestion Resulted In Epigastric Pain (3 Cases), Externalized Gastrointestinal Bleeding With Epigastralgia (2 Cases), And No Symptoms (8 Cases). Of The 13 Cases Of Foreign Body Ingestion, 6 Patients Underwent Endoscopic Extraction In The Gastroenterology Department. Extraction Was By Diathermic Loop, Dormia Loop And Endoscopic Basket. Successful Extraction Was Achieved In 4 Cases (66.66%), And Unsuccessful Extraction In 2 Cases (33.33%). Only One Inmate Required Surgical Extraction, And In 6 Patients The Elimination Of Foreign Bodies In The Stool Was Spontaneous Under Medical Supervision. Conclusion: Foreign Body Ingestion Is Frequent And Voluntary In The Prison Environment. It Is Characterized By The Multiplicity Of Foreign Bodies. The Rate Of Successful Extraction Of Ingested Foreign Bodies In Our Practice Is Satisfactory, Requiring An Experienced Endoscopist To Perform The Extraction Without Complications And Avoid Recourse To Surgery. Education Of The Prison Population Is Important, And Psychological Follow-Up Is Essential.

We Aimed To Profile The Characteristics And  Evaluate The Care Of Such Patients In This Study. Methods: Adult Patients With An  Endoscopic Record Of Attempted Foreign Body Retrieval Between January 2013 And  September 2020 Were Identified At Three Australian Hospitals. Those With A  Documented Mental Health Diagnosis Were Included And Their Standard Medical  Records Reviewed. Presentation History, Demographics, Comorbidities And  Endoscopic Findings Were Recorded And Described. Results: A Total Of 166  Admissions Were Accounted For By 35 Patients, 2/3 Of Which Had Borderline  Personality Disorder (Bpd). Repetitive Presentations Occurred In More Than Half  Of The Cohort. There Was An Increased Trend Of Hospital Admissions Throughout The  Years. At Least Half Of The Cohort Had A Documented Mental Health Review During  Their Admission. An Average Of 3.3 (2.9) Foreign Bodies Were Ingested Per Single  Episode. Endoscopic Intervention Was Performed In 76.5% Of Incidents. The  Combined Length Of Stay For All Patients Was 680 Days. Conclusion: Deliberate  Foreign Body Ingestion In Mental Health Patients Is A Common, Recurring And  Challenging Problem That Is Increasing In Frequency And Requires Collaborative  Research To Further Guide Holistic Management.

AU  - Abbasi M.H.
JO  - International Journal Of High Risk Behaviors And Addiction
AB  - Introduction: Intentional Swallowing Of Foreign Objects Is A Relatively Rare Psychopathological Behavior. Adolescents And Young Adults May Carry Out This Act To Hurt Themselves Or Even Suicide. Often, Most Reports Related To Deliberate Swallowing Are Typically Either Surgical Or Gastrointestinal And Rarely Are Found In Psychiatric Articles; More Often, The Swallowed Foreign Objects (80 - 90%) Are Disposed Of Spontaneously, And 10 - 20% Of Them Require Endoscopy For More Study And Less Than 1% Of Them Need Surgery To Be Removed Or Its Complications. Case Presentation: The Presented Patient Is A 17-Year-Old Girl Admitted To The Psychosomatic Ward Of Afzalipour Hospital Due To Intentional Poisoning. During The Year Before Her Admission, On Three Separate Occasions, She Detached The Knife Blade From Its Haft And Swallowed It. She Underwent Laparotomy Twice, One Time For Sigmoid Tearing And Damage To The Left Ovary, To Remove The Knife And Regeneration Of The Left Ovary And Sigmoid, And Another Time To Remove The Knife In Order Not To Cause Damage To Her Intestines. To Our Knowledge, This Is The First Reported Case In The World In Which An Ovary Has Been Damaged. Further Investigation Into Her Background Shows Some Extent Of Privation Due To Her Family’S Long-Term Economic Problems And Instability; Moreover, Sexual And Physical Abuse Was Also Confirmed. The Patient Was Prescribed Clozapine, Which Decreased Her Suicidal Behavior And Attempts Noticeably. Conclusions: Swallowing Foreign Bodies In This Patient Is Interpreted As Both Self-Punishment And Punishing Others (Those Who Thought They Were Hurt Or May Be Blamed For Their Despair Or Rejection). Intentional Swallowing Of Foreign Objects Behavior Is More Resistant Than Other Self-Harming Activities And May Have A Worse Prognosis. Swallowing Foreign Objects Requires A Sophisticated Process That, If Not Correctly Managed, May Result In Serious Complications; Therefore, Appropriate Psychiatric Counseling And Supportive Treatment Are Necessary For These Patients. Specific To This Patient Eliminating The Effects Of Suicide And Reaching Medical Stability With A Short Admission Was Necessary. Her Suicidal Behavior And Attempts Decreased Significantly After Starting Clozapine Treatment. Therefore, Clozapine Treatment Is Recommended For Patients With Suicidal Behavior And Self-Harm. © 2023, Brieflands. All Rights Reserved.

JO  - Journal Of Psychiatric Practice
AB  - Intentional Foreign Body Ingestions (Fbis) Are Commonly Seen In Adult Patients With Intellectual Disabilities, Substance Use, Severe Psychiatric Conditions, Or  External Motivations, But These Cases Are Rarely Reported In The Psychiatric  Literature. We Present The Case Of A Patient With An Extensive History Of Fbis  And Suicide Attempts And A Multitude Of Psychiatric Diagnoses Including  Borderline Personality Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Posttraumatic Stress  Disorder From Significant Abuse In Foster Care, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,  And Pica. During The Single Hospitalization Described In This Report, She Had  Multiple Incidents Of Self-Harm, Aggression, And 9 Fbis. A Multidisciplinary Team  Involving Psychiatry, Emergency Medicine, Gastroenterology, Surgery, Internal  Medicine, Nursing, Social Work, Behavioral Health Technicians, Case Management,  Chaplain, The Legal Department, Police Officers, And Hospital Maintenance Was  Necessary For Care Coordination. Interventions Included 8 Endoscopies And An  Abdominal Surgery To Retrieve Swallowed Foreign Bodies, Pain Management,  Psychopharmacological And Psychotherapeutic Interventions For Agitation, And  Environmental Precautions To Minimize The Risk Of Ingestion. Ultimately, To  Prevent Further Trauma And Limit Additional Opportunities For Fbi, A  Collaborative Decision Was Made With The Patient To Discharge Her To Her Home  With Outpatient Psychologist And Psychiatrist Support. This Case Describes The  Complexities Of Hospital Management Of A Patient With Intentional Recurrent Fbi,  Highlighting The Importance Of A Critical Assessment Of Risk Versus Benefit For  Prolonging Hospitalization. Development Of Practical Management Protocols And  Risk Assessments For Continued Hospitalization Is Necessary For Patients With  Recurrent Intentional Fbis.

AB  - Foreign Body Ingestion Is A Common Problem That Can Result In Severe Consequences. It Occurs Commonly In Children And Rarely In Adults. High-Risk  Adults Include Illicit Drug Users, Prisoners, Edentulous Adults, Alcoholics,  Psychiatric Patients, Adults With Mental Retardation, Or Those With Decreased  Oral Tactile Sensation. In Adults, Most Foreign Body Impactions Are Seen In  Patients With Pre-Existing Pathologies, Such As Malignancy, Achalasia,  Strictures, And Esophageal Rings. Complications That Foreign Bodies May Cause In  Some Cases Are Tracheoesophageal Fistula, Aorto-Esophageal Fistula, And  Intramural Perforation. This Case Illustrates The Importance Of Including Foreign  Body Ingestion In The Differential Diagnosis Of Dysphagia In High-Risk Groups,  Even When No Clear History Suggests This As A Cause, Which May Decrease The  Complications.

AB  - Foreign Body Ingestions Are Common Medical Emergencies. In Adults, Foreign Body Ingestions Occur In Patients With Psychiatric Disorders And Prison Inmates. A  Majority (80-90%) Of Foreign Bodies Pass Spontaneously. Endoscopic And Surgical  Interventions Are Required In Only 10-20% And 1%, Respectively. A Plain  Radiograph May Be The Only Diagnostic Test Required. A Computed Tomography Scan  May Be Needed When A Perforation Is Suspected. Food Boluses Are The Most Commonly  Ingested Foreign Bodies. Snare And Rat Tooth Forceps Are Frequently Used  Accessories For The Retrieval Of Foreign Bodies. The Focus Of The Emergency Team  Is On The Management Of An Acute Case Of Foreign Body Ingestion, And The  Psychiatric Aspect Of The Disease Gets Often Ignored.

JO  - World Journal Of Gastroenterology
AB  - There Has Been A Rapid Expansion In The Knowledge Of Paediatric Gastroenterology Over The Recent Decade, With A Fast-Growing Repertoire Of Diagnostic Techniques  And Management Strategies For A Wide Spectrum Of Childhood Gastrointestinal (Gi)  Diseases. Paediatric Gi Endoscopy Is A Core Competency Every Paediatric  Gastroenterologist Should Possess, And Represents One Of The Most Common  Procedures Performed In Children For Both Diagnostic And Therapeutic Purposes.  Yet There Remains A Dearth Of Literature On The Utility And Outcomes Of  Paediatric Gi Endoscopy In The Asia-Pacific Region. Data On The Diagnostic Value  Of Paediatric Gi Endoscopy Would Be An Important Aspect Of Discussion, With The  Emergence Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ibd) And Eosinophilic Gi Disease As  Increasingly Common Endoscopic Diagnoses. Time-Based Trends In Paediatric Gi  Endoscopy Do Point Towards More Ibd And Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Related  Complications Being Diagnosed, With A Declining Incidence Of Gi Bleeding.  However, The Real-World Diagnostic Value Of Endoscopy In Asia Must Be  Contextualised To The Region-Specific Prevalence Of Paediatric Gi Diseases.  Helicobacter Pylori Infection, Particularly That Of Multidrug-Resistant Strains,  Remains A Highly Prevalent Problem In Specific Regions. Paediatric Functional Gi  Disorders Still Account For The Majority Of Childhood Gi Complaints In Most  Centres, Hence The Diagnostic Yield Of Endoscopy Should Be Critically Evaluated  In The Absence Of Alarm Symptoms. Gi Therapeutic Endoscopy Is Also Occasionally  Required For Children With Ingested Foreign Bodies, Intestinal Polyposis Or  Oesophageal Strictures Requiring Dilation. Endoscopic Haemostasis Is A  Potentially Life-Saving Skill In Cases Of Massive Gi Bleeding Typically From  Varices Or Peptic Ulcers. Advanced Endoscopic Techniques Such As Capsule  Endoscopy And Balloon-Assisted Enteroscopy Have Found Traction, Particularly In  East Asian Centres, As Invaluable Diagnostic And Therapeutic Tools In The  Management Of Ibd, Obscure Gi Bleeding And Intestinal Polyposis. State Of The Art  Endoscopic Diagnostics And Therapeutics, Including The Use Of Artificial  Intelligence-Aided Endoscopy Algorithms, Real-Time Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy  And Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy, Are Expected To Gain More Utility In Paediatrics.  As Paediatric Gastroenterology Matures As A Subspecialty In Asia, It Is Essential  Current Paediatric Endoscopists And Future Trainees Adhere To Minimum Practice  Standards, And Keep Abreast Of The Evolving Trends In The Diagnostic And  Therapeutic Value Of Endoscopy. This Review Discusses The Available Published  Literature On The Utility Of Paediatric Gi Endoscopy In Asia Pacific, With The  Relevant Clinical Outcomes.

AB  - Background: Deliberate Foreign Body Ingestion (Dfbi) Presents Unique Medical, Surgical, And Ethical Challenges. Often, Patients With Psychiatric Conditions Repeatedly Ingest Foreign Bodies, Leading To Frequent Emergency Department Visits. Standardised Management Guidelines Are Lacking, Resulting In High Hospitalisation Rates, Interventions, And Complications. This Study Focuses On Recent Dfbi Cases At Our Institution, Providing Insights Into This Complex Condition And Holistic Management. Methods: Patients Admitted By The Surgical Team At Croydon University Hospital Between 2017 And 2023 With Dfbi Were Included. Data On Demographics, Clinical Presentation, Investigations, And Management Were Collected. Complications, Hospitalisations, Interventions, And Cost Analysis Were Recorded. Results: Eight Patients Presented A Total Of 52 Times. The Incidence Of Dfbi Increased Over Time. Swallowed Objects Included Knives, Needles, Magnets, Glass, Batteries, Pencils, Gloves, Lighters, And Screws. Each Patient Underwent An Average Of 21 X-Rays, 2 Ct Scans, And 3 Ogds. Eleven Laparotomies And 1 Laparoscopy Were Performed. The Average Length Of Stay Was 44.5 Days. Complications Included Pulmonary Embolism, Pneumonia, Enterotomy, Hernia, And Infection. The Average Cost Per Patient Was £30,866.25. Conclusions: Dfbi Poses A Significant Burden On Healthcare Systems. Patients Face Radiation Exposure And Repeated Invasive Interventions, Necessitating A Comprehensive Approach. Understanding Dfbi From A Biopsychosocial And Ethical Perspective Is Crucial. A Multidisciplinary Team Should Be Involved Early, With Clear Goals. Further Research Is Needed For Optimal Management Pathways.

Patients Who  Notoriously Swallow Foreign Objects Generate Significant Economic Costs To  Hospitals. In Previous Publications, It Has Been Argued That Hospitals Might  Reduce The Need For Endoscopy By Offering Such Patients A Paid Position To  Discourage Foreign Body Ingestions. However, The Game-Theoretical Analysis  Offered In The Literature Was Based On A Static Game Which Did Not Justify The  Relevant Equilibrium. To Obtain The Actual Goal Of Keeping The Patient Away From  Foreign Body Ingestion, We Consider A Repeated Game With An Infinite Horizon. We  Show That There Exists A Combination Of Strategies Applied By The Hospital And  The Patient That Leads To A Steady State In Which The Patient Will Be Discouraged  From Foreign Body Ingestion.

However, To Date There Have Been No Critical Evaluations Of Their  Methodological Rigor Or Quality. Herein, We Address This Need Via The Appraisal  Of Guidelines For Research And Evaluation (Agree Ii) Instrument. Methods: A  Literature Search Of Embase, Medline Via Pubmed, And Scopus Was Performed Up  Until February 25, 2021. Identified Cpgs Were Then Assessed By Four Independent  Reviewers Trained In Agree Ii. A Scaled Domain Score Of >60% Was Indicated As  Satisfactory Quality. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (Icc) Were Calculated  To Assess Inter-Reviewer Agreement. Results: 11 Guidelines Were Assessed With  Only One Being Classified As High Quality And Others Being Either Average (Two)  Or Low Quality (Eight). Domain 4 (Clarity Of Presentation) Achieved The Highest  Mean Score (66.41 ± 13.33%), While Domain 5 (Applicability) Achieved The Lowest  Score (10.80 ± 10.37%). Icc Analysis Revealed Generally Strong Agreement Between  Reviewers With A Range Of 0.60-0.98. Conclusion: Quality Appraisal Using The  Agree Ii Instrument Suggests That The Methodologic Rigor And Quality Of Current  Guidelines For The Diagnosis And Management Of Pediatric Foreign Body Aspiration  And Ingestion Need Significant Improvement.

AB  - Introduction And Importance: A Bezoar Is An Indigestible Food Or Other Material Within The Gastrointestinal Tract. It Can Be Ingested Intentionally Or  Accidentally. The Small Bowel Bezoar Prevalence Ranges Between 0.4 % And 4 %, And  The Prevalence Is Less Than 0.5 % For Gastric Bezoars. There Are Different Types  Of Bezoars, But The Mention Of A Plastic Bezoar Rarely Appears In The Literature.  To Our Knowledge, This Is The First Reported Case Of A Plastic Bezoar In The  Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia. Case Presentation: A 58-Year-Old Woman Was Admitted For  Acute Kidney Injury, And While Working Her Up, It Was Discovered That She Had A  Possible Foreign Body On Computerized Tomography Scan. As A Result, She Underwent  Exploratory Laparotomy With The Findings Of Plastic Foreign Objects Identified  90 Cm From The Ileocecal Valve And Other Objects Identified In The Stomach.  Clinical Discussion: The Impaction Of These Materials Often Occurs In Narrow  Areas Such As The Lower Esophagus, Duodenum, Ileocecal Valve Or Even The Anus. In  This Unique Case, Two Points Of Impaction Were Noted: The First Was In The Small  Bowel And The Second Point In The Stomach. The Approach To Such Cases Could Be  Endoscopic Versus Surgical Or Even Chemical Dissolution As A Choice Of Treatment  Is Dependent On Multiple Factors. Conclusion: The Approach To These Cases Is  Multidisciplinary And Depends On The Availability Of Services And Resources At  The Treating Hospital. Reporting Such Cases Helps In Managing Challenging  Situations. Additionally, A Psychiatric Assessment Is A Crucial Step.

AB  - Purpose: Disk Battery (Db) Ingestion In Children Can Lead To Severe Complications And Mortality. This Study Details Our Experience In Managing Db Ingestion And Its  Complications. Methods: We Analyzed Data From All Patients Treated For Db  Ingestion At Our Hospital From June 2010 To January 2024. A Protocol Established  In 2010 Requires Angio-Ct Scans For Esophageal Db Cases And A Multidisciplinary  Approach Involving Gastroenterologists, Otolaryngologists, Pediatric And Airway  Surgeons, And Cardiac Surgeons. Results: We Treated 22 Patients. In June 2010,  Following The Tragic Death Of A Patient From An Undiagnosed Db Ingestion That Led  To An Aortoesophageal Fistula, Our Protocol Was Established. All Dbs Were Removed  Endoscopically. Four Patients Needed Additional Surgery: Two Had Tracheal  Resection/Anastomosis And Esophageal Repair For Large Tracheoesophageal Fistulas;  One Required Aortic Wall Reinforcement With A Patch; One Underwent Endoscopic  Removal With A Sternal Split To Explore The Aortic Arch. All 22 Patients Survived  And Recovered Clinically. One Developed Bilateral Vocal Cord Palsy As A  Complication. Conclusion: Effective Management Of Db Ingestion Complications  Necessitates A Collaborative, Multidisciplinary Approach. Our Protocol Has  Improved Management Strategies And Patient Outcomes.

AB  - Foreign Body Ingestion In Adults Is A Rare Occurrence; However, Intentional Ingestion Cases Are Reported Among Prisoners And Individuals With Psychiatric Disorders. Here, We Reported Two Unusual Cases Of Foreign Body Ingestion In Two Adults With Psychiatric Disorders. A 32-Year-Old Female Presented To The Emergency Department With Self-Harm To The Abdomen To Extract A Needle Under Her Skin. Radiologic Images Showed Multiple Sewing Needles In The Gastrointestinal Tract And Adjacent Structures. In The Other Case, A 23-Year-Old Male Presented With Rectal Bleeding After Ingesting Metallic Screws. His Previous And New Scans Revealed Multiple Metallic Screws And Safety Pins Throughout The Gastrointestinal Tract. Both Patients Had A History Of Chronic Foreign Body Ingestion And Had Never Been Operated. The Aim Of This Report Is To Raise A Question Whether Non-Operative Follow-Up Could Be A Treatment Of Choice After The Ingestion Of Sharp Objects Such As Sewing Needles And Metallic Screws.

AB  - Suicide Is A Leading Cause Of Death Worldwide And Takes Many Forms, Which Include Hanging, Jumping From A Height, Sharp Force Trauma, Ingestion/Poisoning, Drowning, And Firearm Injuries. Self-Harm And Suicide Are Associated With Particular Injuries And Patterns Of Injury. Many Of These Patterns Are Apparent On Imaging. Self-Harm Or Suicidal Intent May Be Overlooked Initially In Such Cases, Particularly When The Patient Is Unconscious Or Uncooperative. Correct Identification Of These Findings By The Radiologist Will Allow A Patient'S Management To Be Tailored Accordingly And May Prevent Future Suicide Attempts. The Initial Role Of The Radiologists In These Cases Is To Identify Life-Threatening Injuries That Require Urgent Medical Attention. The Radiologist Can Add Value By Drawing Attention To Associated Injuries, Which May Have Been Missed On Initial Clinical Assessment. In Many Cases Of Self-Harm And Suicide, Imaging Is More Reliable Than Clinical Assessment. The Radiologist May Be Able To Provide Important Prognostic Information That Allows Clinicians To Manage Expectations And Plan Appropriately. Furthermore, Some Imaging Studies Will Provide Essential Forensic Information. Unfortunately, Many Cases Of Attempted Suicide Will End In Brain Death. The Radiologist May Have A Role In These Cases In Identifying Evidence Of Hypoxic–Ischaemic Brain Injury, Confirming A Diagnosis Of Brain Death Through Judicious Use Of Ancillary Tests And, Finally, In Donor Screening For Organ Transplantation. A Review Is Presented To Illustrate The Imaging Features Of Self-Harm, Suicide, And Brain Death, And To Highlight The Important Role Of The Radiologist In These Cases. © 2024 The Royal College Of Radiologists

AB  - Objectives And Studyaccidental Foreign Body Ingestion (Fbi) Is A Common Pediatric Referral Concern. In Contrast, Recurrent And Intentional Fbi (Rifbi) Is Infrequent And Associated With Greater Endoscopic And Surgical Intervention In Adults. Although Pediatric Guidelines Exist For Fbi, The Risk And Therapeutic Implications Of Rifbi Are Not Addressed. An Anonymous International Survey On Pediatric Gastroenterologist Experience With Rifbi Was Distributed.Methodsa 33-Item Redcap (C) Survey Was Distributed Via Email To Pediatric Gastroenterologists Identified Through Mailing And Email Lists Obtained From Pediatric Gastroenterology Professional Organizations.Resultsduring 9-12/2021 We Accrued 202 Completed Surveys. Respondents Were From 27 Countries And Across The Career Span. Eighty Percent Reported Experience With Rifbi; 74% Reported Seeing <= 3 Patients With Rifbi Within The Past 24 Months And 4% Reported Seeing >= 6. Of Those Who Treated Rifbi, 38% Reported An Average Number Of Annual Ingestions Per Patient Was >= 5. Frequent Morbidity But Not Mortality Was Reported. Half Reported Adherence To Fbi Guidelines. Later-Career Endoscopists Treated Rifbi More Aggressively Than Accidental Ingestion. Ninety-Six Percent Noted That Patients With Rifbi Had Psychiatric Comorbidities. Providers At Academic Medical Centers Reported Referring To Behavioral Health More Than Those In Other Settings.Resultsduring 9-12/2021 We Accrued 202 Completed Surveys.

Greater Likelihood Of Adverse Outcomes Associated With Endoscopy Was Reported. Most Reported Referral To Behavioral Health And Few Had Rifbi Management Protocols. A Broader Spectrum Of Psychologic Comorbidities In The Pediatric Population With Rifbi, Notably Depression And Autism Spectrum Disorder, Were Reported. Image Rifbi In Adults Is Associated With Psychiatric Comorbidity, Increased Treatment Complications, And High Treatment Cost Little Is Known About Rifbi In Pediatrics And How Intentional Ingestion Impacts Endoscopic Managementwhat Is New Our International Survey Suggests That While Prevalence Of Rifbi In Pediatrics Is Low, Reoccurrence Is High (E.G., 1/3 Respondents Reported Seeing Rifbi Patients Presenting With >= 5 Ingestions Annually) Psychiatric Comorbidities, Including Multiple Morbidities, Are Overwhelmingly Present In Pediatric Rifbi High Rates Of Morbidity Are Reported In Treatment Of Rifbi Coordinated Multidisciplinary Care, Including Behavioral Health, May Help To Reduce Recurrence

JO  - Journal Of Laryngology And Otology
AB  - Background: Ingested Foreign Bodies Pose A Unique Challenge In Medical Practice, Especially When Lodged In The Oesophagus. While Endoscopic Retrieval Is The  Standard Treatment, Certain Cases Require More Innovative Approaches. Methods:  This Paper Reports The Case Of A Patient Who Intentionally Ingested A Butter  Knife That Lodged In The Thoracic Oesophagus. After Multiple Endoscopic Attempts,  A Lateral Neck Oesophagotomy, Aided Using A Hopkins Rod Camera And An Improvised  Trochar As A Protective Port, Was Performed. Results: The Foreign Body Was  Successfully Extracted Without Causing Oesophageal Perforation. The Patient Was  Made Nil By Mouth, With Nasogastric Feeding Only Until A Swallow Assessment After  One Week. The Patient Was Discharged And Recovered Well. Conclusion: This Case  Illustrates A Successful, Innovative Approach To Removing A Foreign Body In A  High-Risk Patient, Highlighting The Significance Of Adaptability In Surgical  Practice. It Emphasises The Need For Individualised Approaches Based On The  Patient'S History, The Nature And Location Of The Foreign Body, And Associated  Risks.

AB  - The Management Of Ingested Foreign Bodies Is A Challenging Task Because Each Case Is Unique With Multiple Varying Factors Including A Patient'S Age, Anatomical  Considerations, Clinical Presentation, And The Type And Location Of The Foreign  Body Ingested. Additionally, Concern Over Complications Associated With Button  Battery Ingestion Typically Drives Management Decisions. The Common Practice Is  The Urgent Retrieval Of The Foreign Body Within Two To Six Hours Of Presentation.  An Unusual Case Is Presented Here That Demonstrated Significantly Delayed  Endoscopic Removal Of An Ingested Button Battery Without Complication, Avoiding  The Many Risks Associated With Any Emergent Endoscopic Procedure. However, This  Practice Is A Case-By-Case Decision Because There Is A Lack Of Literature To  Guide The Current Management.

AB  - Background: A Ban On Neodymium Magnets Was Lifted By The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission In 2016. Pediatric Gastroenterologists And Surgeons Were  Increasingly Tasked With Removing These Problematic Objects. The Purpose Of This  Study Was To Assess The Utility Of Single-Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (Sils) In  The Management Of Ingested Magnets. Patients And Methods: This Is A  Single-Center, Retrospective Assessment Of Surgical Interventions For Ingested  Magnets. International Classification Of Disease, 10Th Revision Codes Were Used  To Identify 349 Patients ≤21 Years Of Age Evaluated For Foreign Body Ingestion  Over A 4.5-Year Period. A Medical Record Review Helped Isolate 29 (8.3%) Magnet  Ingestions, 9 Requiring Surgical Intervention. Redcap Was Used For Analysis.  Results: Of 9 Surgical Patients, 7 Underwent Sils Intervention By 1 Surgeon.  Another Surgeon Performed An Open Operation, Whereas A Third Performed A  Multiport Operation. Of The 7 Sils Cases, 3 Were Completed Without Conversion To  Open. In One Of These Cases, Bowel Resection With Primary Anastomosis Was  Performed. For Sils Cases, Average Operating Room Time Was 109 Minutes (38-170  Minutes), Time To Enteral Feeds Was 23 Hours (0.28-79.2 Hours), And Hospital  Length Of Stay (Los) Was 3.8 Days (1.96-6.68 Days). Thirty-Day Readmission For  Sils Was 14.3%. No Other Complications Were Observed. Conclusions: Sils Has Been  Safely Utilized For Magnet Retrieval. It Offers An Ability To Identify The  Affected Intestinal Segment And An Opportunity To Intervene Extracorporeally  Through An Uncapped Port. In Addition, Knowing Where Matted Bowel Is Located Can  Direct A Limited Incision During Conversion To Laparotomy. This May Confer  Benefits Of Decreased Pain, Shortened Time To Enteral Feeds, And Decreased  Hospital Los.

AB  - Foreign Bodies May Be Ingested Accidentally Or Intentionally. Generally, They Pass Through The Digestive Tract Without Causing Complications Unless They Become  Lodged. Patients Often Present With Nonspecific Clinical Symptoms, And Diagnosis  Is Frequently Delayed Because They Do Not Recall Ingesting Anything. We Report  The Case Of A 20-Year-Old Man Who Was Admitted To The Emergency Room For Acute  Moderate Hematemesis. The Patient Had No Significant Medical History. An Urgent,  Nonsedated Upper Gastrointestinal (Gi) Endoscopy Was Performed, Which Revealed  Bleeding But No Foreign Objects. However, An Abdominal Ct Scan Identified A  Linear Calcified Object In The Antrum, Which Was Later Confirmed To Be A Chicken  Bone Upon Endoscopic Extraction. Ingested Foreign Bodies Typically Pass Through  The Digestive Tract Without Incident. However, Long, Sharp, And Thin Objects Can  Remain In The Gastrointestinal Tract For 7-10 Days And May Become Lodged In Areas  Of Physiological Narrowing. This Can Lead To Complications Such As Bowel  Obstruction, Perforation, Or Bleeding.

AB  - Background: Determining Whether Prompt Surgery Is Required For Patient With Ingested Foreign Bodies Is Clinically Important. Purpose: To Evaluate The  Potential Value Of Computed Tomography (Ct) In Guiding The Selection Of Surgical  Treatment For Patients With Ingested Foreign Bodies In The Lower Gastrointestinal  Tract. Methods: Between January 2014 And December 2023, We Analyzed The Data Of  58 Patients (Median Age: 65.4 Years; Range, 31-96 Years) With Ingested Foreign  Bodies In The Lower Gastrointestinal Tract Who Underwent Ct Examinations.  Patients Were Treated Either Conservatively (35 Cases) Or Surgically (23 Cases).  The Angle Between The Long Axis Of The Foreign Body And The Intestinal Canal  (Fb-Ic Angle) Was Measured. Ct Findings And Clinical Variables Were Evaluated To  Identify Potential Indicators For Surgical Treatment Through Univariate And  Multivariate Logistic Regression Analyses. Results: Univariate Analysis Revealed  The Fb-Ic Angle (P = 0.002), Presence Of Free Peritoneal Gas (P = 0.002), White  Blood Cell Count (P = 0.018), And Neutrophil Count (P = 0.007) As Significant  Factors Associated With Surgical Treatment. Multivariate Analysis Demonstrated  That The Fb-Ic Angle (Odds Ratio, 1.033; P = 0.045) And The Presence Of Free  Peritoneal Gas (Odds Ratio, 41.335; P = 0.002) Are Independent Indicators For  Surgical Management. The Fb-Ic Angle Showed An Area Under The Receiver Operating  Characteristic Curve Of 0.755, With A Cutoff Value Of 51.25 Degrees. Conclusion:  The Fb-Ic Angle And Presence Of Free Peritoneal Gas Serve As Potential Predictive  Imaging Markers For Surgical Intervention.
