The phenomenology of this behavior, as well as its psychiatric and medical complications are discussed. It is probable that chronic nicotinism contributed to this patient's refractoriness to psychiatric treatment and to his eventual cardiovascular crisis. The occurrence of pica as a manifestation of severe psychopathology was vividly described by the early pioneers of neuropsychiatry, but has received little attention in recent psychiatric literature. This is in marked contrast to the syndrome of psychogenic water intoxication which continues to be reported frequently. The majority of descriptions of pica have dealt with its occurrence in children, in pregnant women, and as a societal practice in certain cultures studied from a medico-anthropologic point of view. The toxic organic brain syndrome caused by chronic ingestion of nicotine-containing products has also been neglected in psychiatric publications. Descriptions of the neuropsychiatric complications of subacute and chronic nicotinism have been restricted to textbooks of toxicology, where greater emphasis has been given to the acute effects of large quantities of nicotine, often in forms other than tobacco. The following case illustrates the near-fatal practice of tobacco pica in a psychotic patient and dramatically demonstrates the systemic and central nervous system effects of nicotinism.",1977-09,2025-04-14 17:19:21,2025-04-14 17:19:21,,724-726,,9,38.0,,Dis Nerv Syst,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 902560,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/902560,,Humans; Adult; Male; Myocardial Infarction; Schizophrenia; Pica; Nicotine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,500

Like other repetitive and ritualistic behaviours, pica may be postulated to fall at times on this spectrum. METHODS: Five cases of pica seen at our clinics are presented here in order to test this hypothesis. Phenomenology, neurobiology (where available) and pharmacotherapy data are provided in order to consider a possible relationship with OCD and OCD spectrum disorders. RESULTS: In 2 of the cases, pica appeared to be a compulsion and patients had additional symptoms which met diagnostic criteria for OCD. In 2 of the cases, the clinical picture and neurobiological data were reminiscent of an impulse control disorder. Four of the 5 patients responded to treatment with a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SRI). CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with a hypothesis that at least some cases of pica may usefully be conceptualised as lying within a compulsive-impulsive spectrum of symptoms and disorders.",1996-12,2025-04-14 15:47:04,2025-04-14 15:47:04,,"1586-1588, 1591-1592",,12 Suppl,86.0,,S Afr Med J,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 9180801,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9180801,,"Humans; Adult; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Child; Antidepressive Agents; Clomipramine; Pica; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder; 1-Naphthylamine; Citalopram; Sertraline; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,529

Quite a good number of interesting and unusual cases of foreign body ingestion has been reported in the surgical literature from time to time.

Accidental ingestion of the foreign body is by far the most common. Deliberate ingestion may result from an act of insanity, a dare, a habit or medicinal therapy. Retention of elongated or pointed objects in the duodenum is a frequent problem. Long, sharp, objects may perforate the duodenum and have been known to migrate widely in the abdomen.

In this report, we present a rare case of razor blades lodged in the appendix as a result of intentional ingestion. Presentation of case A 25 year old male prisoner presented to our hospital with persistent right iliac fossa pain after razor blade ingestion. After 5 days of conservative management, there was no sign of transition on serial X-Rays. Laparoscopy with intraoperative image intensification confirmed the presence of the razor blades in the appendix and appendicectomy was subsequently performed without complications. Discussion Most ingested objected with diameter less than 2.5 cm and length less than 6 cm can pass through the gastrointestinal tract spontaneously in less than one week. The entry of foreign objects into the appendix is thought to be due to relative low motility of the caecum, the dependent position of the appendix and the size of the appendiceal orifice. Radiographic localisation to the appendiceal lumen was complicated by metallic artefact, but was consistent with failure to transit. Appendicectomy was felt to be the safest mode of retrieval. Conclusion Ingested foreign body lodged in the appendix is a rare event. Once the exact location is confirmed, a simple laparoscopic appendicectomy can be performed to facilitate the removal.",2018-01-01,2025-04-14 14:34:52,2025-04-14 14:34:52,2025-04-14 14:34:52,29-32,,,45.0,,International Journal of Surgery Case Reports,Ingested razor blades within the appendix,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/47T66669/Cui et al. - 2018 - Ingested razor blades within the appendix A rare .pdf; /Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/6KCXN4ID/S2210261218300981.html,,,Laparoscopy; Case report; Foreign body ingestion; Appendicectomy; Appendicitis; Razor blades,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,659

Treatment depends on the size and kind of foreign bodies. When complications arise, patients may require urgent medical attention. Self-harm by sharp foreign body ingestion is a rare event that must always be promptly treated and should always be prevented. Psychiatric patients and inmates are the most affected population. A high index of suspicion is required to treat this rare condition, which may be preventable if there is adequate mental and medical therapy along with close monitoring and family support. We present the case of a 31-year-old psychiatric patient. After prompt treatment, two razor blades were surgically removed from her intestines.

The majority of foreign bodies are passed smoothly with no problems if they passed the esophagus, however some may be lodged in areas of anatomical narrowing which may require endoscopic or surgical intervention. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year -old mentally abnormal woman presented to the emergency department complaining from abdominal pain for 2 days. The family reported a history of ingestion of multiple metallic nails one week before presentation. Abdominal examination showed generalized tenderness and guarding. Plain abdominal X-ray showed multiple metallic nails in the upper abdomen and the right lower abdomen. Laparotomy was performed, one of the nails was causing perforation of the gastric wall, huge number of metallic nails were extracted from the stomach and cecum, appendectomy was performed. CONCLUSION: Ingestion of sharp and long foreign bodies usually requires surgical intervention, after surgery close observation and psychological consultation is required to prevent repeated ingestions.",2020,2025-03-30 10:17:58,2025-03-30 10:17:58,,60-63,,,70.0,,Int J Surg Case Rep,Ingestion of huge number of metallic nails impacted in the stomach and cecum in a mentally abnormal woman,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 32413769 PMCID: PMC7226636,,/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/I8B2J6Y2/Mohammed - 2020 - Ingestion of huge number of metallic nails impacte.pdf; ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32413769,,Endoscopy; Foreign bodies; Laparotomy; Acute abdomen; Metallic nails; Plain abdominal X-ray,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,671

We present the case of a 45-year-old woman presenting to the emergency department following the intentional ingestion of multiple screws and nails, complaining of acute abdominal pain and nausea. Imaging revealed four nails in the colon and two adjacent screws in the distal small bowel. In the absence of signs of acute obstruction or bowel perforation, she was admitted for expectant management but subsequently required endoscopic removal of two retained screws in the lower GI tract.",2023-08-07,2025-03-30 10:23:37,2025-03-30 10:23:37,2025-03-30 10:23:37,,,8,15.0,,,Loose Screws,,,,,,,en,,,,,www.cureus.com,,Publisher: Cureus,,/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/7S2Q4B6S/Hardy et al. - 2023 - Loose Screws Removal of Foreign Bodies From the L.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,685
