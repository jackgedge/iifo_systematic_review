Choking (often also called  suffocation) can be caused by food or inedible objects and leads to various  degrees of asphyxiation or lack of oxygen in the blood stream. The incidence is  very high in both young children and adults, especially seniors. However, since  not all choking episodes end up in the emergency room or become fatalities, they  often escape statistics. Although episodes of choking from non-edible bodies are  infrequent, they affect mostly young children. Three of the most common risks for  choking in general are neurological disorders, dysphagia and dental issues (few  or no teeth, unstable or unsuitable prosthesis or orthodontic appliances).  The  purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk factors of choking and ways to  reduce/avoid this event. We reported data on a series of 138 patients admitted to  the emergency department following a choking event, at a hospital in Rome, Italy.  The age group of the analyzed population ranged from 1 to 88 years, with the most  represented age group of these between 40 and 59, with a similar distribution  between males and females. The types of foods on which people choked reflected  the seasonal, traditional and local foods: 67% of patients reported choking on  fish bones followed by meat bones (9%)  and artichokes (3%). Three relevant  non-food choking elements reported were: orthodontic items, toothpicks and pins  (one occurrence each). We also reported on two clinical cases of patients choking  on meat and a chicken bone. In conclusion, choking awareness and prevention are  essential for implementing potential life-saving precautions. Prevention is the  first tool to reduce the occurrence of this event, therefore it is necessary to  analyze the risk factors and educate the population to eliminate them. Proper  chewing and oral manipulation are paramount functions in preventing choking,  along with meal-time supervision if little children and elderly. Then, it  behooves the healthcare professionals to disseminate knowledge.","2023-10-27","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","","","4","33","","Eur J Transl Myol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 37905785  PMCID: PMC10811631","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several brands of these  expanding wood glues (those containing diphenylmethane diisocyanate [MDI]) have  the potential to form gastrointestinal (GI) foreign bodies if ingested. The  ingested adhesive forms an expanding ball of glue in the esophagus and gastric  lumen. This expansion is caused by a polymerization reaction using the heat,  water, and gastric acids of the stomach. A firm mass is created that can be 4-8  times its original volume. As little as 2 oz of glue have been reported to  develop gastric foreign bodies. The obstructive mass is reported to form within  minutes of ingestion of the adhesive. The foreign body can lead to esophageal  impaction and obstruction, airway obstruction, gastric outflow obstruction,  mucosal hemorrhage, ulceration, laceration, perforation of the esophageal and  gastric linings, and death. Clinical signs following ingestion include anorexia,  lethargy, vomiting, tachypnea, and abdominal distention and pain, and typically  develop within 12 hours. Clinical signs may depend upon the size of the mass. If  left untreated, perforation and rupture of the esophagus or stomach can occur.  The glue mass does not stick to the GI mucosa and is not always detectable on  abdominal palpation. Radiographs are recommended to confirm the presence of the  ""glue-ball"" foreign body, and radiographic evidence of the obstruction may be  seen as early as 4-6 hours following ingestion. Emesis is contraindicated owing  to the risk of aspiration of the glue into the respiratory tree or the subsequent  lodging of the expanding glue mass in the esophagus. Likewise, efforts to dilute  the glue and prevent the formation of the foreign body through administration of  liquids, activated charcoal, or bulk-forming products to push the foreign body  through the GI tract have proven ineffective. Even endoscopy performed to remove  the foreign body has been shown to be unreliable. The safest, most effective, and  successful therapy is surgical intervention to remove the GI foreign body. If  performed early enough, complete recovery of the animal can be expected.  Differential diagnoses for polyurethane adhesive ingestion include any potential  cause of GI obstruction. The public is largely unaware of the hazards that  ingestion of this product may produce. Public education efforts are needed to  inform pet owners about the hazards of these glues and the overall importance of  providing our companion animals with safe, poison-free environments.","2013-02","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","28-31","","1","28","","Top Companion Anim Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013.

When unwitnessed, it poses therapeutic and diagnostic challenges especially in the  presence of pre-existing anatomical pathology. We aim to analyze the clinical  course, management, and outcome of children with impacted esophageal FBs.  METHODS: Retrospective chart review (Jan 2000-Feb 2018) recruiting children with  impacted esophageal FBs. FBs in cricopharynx and those that moved to stomach were  excluded. Investigations/management were based on underlying anatomical  pathology, duration of impaction, and difficult FBs. Clinical details,  management, and outcomes were collated. RESULTS: Of 86 children, N1 = 31 had  identifiable predisposing anatomic pathology and N2 = 55 had impactions in normal  esophagus or difficult FBs. N1 group presented early (42 months), had recurrent  impactions (1-6), and needed multiple dilatations (0-8) and longer follow-up (avg  35 months). Food matter was commonest impaction. Many had persistent symptoms. N2  group had commonly coin impactions and strictures developed in long standing or  corrosive FBs. Most were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Abnormal esophageal anatomy  predisposes to impaction with organic food bolus. Age of presentation is earlier  with recurrent impactions requiring multiple dilatations/surgery and longer  follow-up. Metallic FBs commonly impact in normal esophagus and are often  innocuous. Atypical/multiple FBs may mirror an underlying psychiatric illness.","2023-01-08","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","73","","1","39","","Pediatr Surg Int","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

The vast majority of pediatric ingestions are  accidental; increasing incidence of intentional ingestions starts in the  adolescent age group. In the United States, the most common pediatric foreign  bodies ingested are coins, followed by a variety of other objects, including  toys, toy parts, sharp objects, batteries, bones, and food. In adolescents and  adults, meat or food impactions are the most common accidental foreign body  ingestion. Esophageal pathology underlies most cases of food impaction.  Management of foreign body ingestions varies based on the object ingested, its  location, and the patient's age and size. Esophageal foreign bodies as a group  require early intervention because of their potential to cause respiratory  symptoms and complications, esophageal erosions, or even an aortoesophageal  fistula. Ingested batteries that lodge in the esophagus require urgent endoscopic  removal even in the asymptomatic patient due to the high risk of complications.  Sharp foreign bodies increase the foreign body complication rate from less than  1% to 15% to 35%, except for straight pins, which usually follow a relatively  benign course unless multiple pins are ingested. Magnets are increasingly  ingested, due to their ubiquitous nature and the perception that they do not pose  a risk. Ingestion of multiple magnets creates a significant risk of obstruction,  perforation, and fistula development. Methods to deal with foreign bodies include  the suture technique, the double snare technique, and the combined forceps/snare  technique for long, large, and sharp foreign bodies, along with newer equipment,  such as retrieval nets and a variety of specialized forceps.","2005-06","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","212-218","","3","7","","Curr Gastroenterol Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15913481","","","","Humans; Child; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal/methods; *Digestive System; *Foreign Bodies/diagnosis/therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various management options have been reported, and there is no  consensus on the ideal management which necessitates the need for a practical  algorithm. The incidence of magnet ingestion has been increasing and directly  related to the laws and recalls. The aim of this review is to provide an easy and  practical pathway for management and to highlight the preventive rules of the  legislations and recalls.

This study aimed to analyse the circumstances  of self-harm and suicide attempts in a Japanese psychiatric hospital so as to  improve management and care. METHODS: Incident reports of self-harm and suicide  attempts during a 12.4-year period from November 2000 to March 2013 were  reviewed. A descriptive analysis was conducted in terms of age, sex, and  diagnosis of patients, as well as level, ward, situations, and causes of  incidents. RESULTS: During the study period, 90 cases of self-harm and attempted  suicide involving 58 patients were reported. The rate of self-harm and suicide  attempts was 0.05 per 1000 patient-days. The types of selfharm and suicide  attempts included hanging (n = 25), wrist cutting (n = 19), ingestion of foreign  objects (n = 17), and others (n = 29). The single case of completed suicide  involved hanging, in a patient with schizophrenia. Among 55 patients with  relevant data, the most common clinical diagnosis was mood disorder (41.8%),  followed by schizophrenia (36.4%). Mood disorder was 3.5 times as prevalent in  females as in males (14 vs. 4). Fourteen patients with mood disorder (n = 8) or  schizophrenia (n = 6) were repeatedly involved in 46 of 89 cases of self-harm or  attempted suicide; 11 were female. One woman with mood disorder attempted suicide  9 times within the same year. The top 3 management and care factors related to  self-harm and suicide attempts were failure to adhere to preventive procedures  (28%), insufficient therapeutic communication (28%), and difficulty in predicting  suicide (20%). CONCLUSION: Self-harm and suicide attempts at this psychiatric  hospital occurred at a rate of 0.05 per 1000 patient-days between late 2000 and  early 2013. Efforts are needed to increase compliance with suicide prevention  procedures and therapeutic communication, so as to improve management and care of  psychiatric in-patients and prevent them from committing suicide.","2018-03","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","23-27","","1","28","","East Asian Arch Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: China PMID: 29576553","","","","Humans; Adult; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Sex Factors; Risk Factors; Comorbidity; Suicide; Prevalence; Hospitals, Psychiatric/statistics & numerical data; Japan/epidemiology; Mood Disorders/*epidemiology; Psychiatric nursing; Risk management; Schizophrenia/*epidemiology; Self-Injurious Behavior/*epidemiology; Self-injurious behaviour; Suicide, Attempted/*statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In adults, foreign body ingestion is more common in  patients with underlying psychiatric comorbidity, the elderly, alcohol  intoxication, and in prisoners. This study reviewed the management of patients  presenting to a tertiary hospital with foreign body ingestion. Patients and  methods A retrospective review of patients presenting with foreign body ingestion  to a tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Victoria, was undertaken from January 2017  to December 2021. Data collected included patient demographics, type of foreign  body, length of stay, imaging modalities, management strategies, and  complications. High-risk ingestion was defined as sharp objects, length >5 cm,  diameter >2.5 cm, button battery and/or magnet ingestion or esophageal as per  international guidelines. Results A total of 157 presentations by 63 patients  with foreign body ingestion occurred between 2017 and 2021 (50% male; median age  30 years). Of the patients, 56% had underlying psychiatric comorbidities. The  majority of presentations occurred in prisoners (65%). The most commonly ingested  objects were batteries (23%), alleged drug-containing balloons (17%), razor  blades (16%), and miscellaneous (40%). High-risk ingestion occurred in  approximately two-thirds of presentations. Conservative management was the most  common approach in 55% of patients. Complications, defined as perforation, bowel  obstruction or fistula formation, did not occur in this cohort despite more than  half presenting with high-risk ingestions. Thirty-day re-presentation rates were  high (31%) and that was most common in patients with intentional ingestion,  underlying mental health disorders, and a documented history of self-harm.  Conclusions Conservative management for patients presenting with recurrent  high-risk foreign body ingestion was safe in appropriately selected cases.  Re-presentation is common and poses significant challenges for health care  providers.","2023-12","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","E1161-E1167","","12","11","","Endosc Int Open","","","","","","","","eng","The Author(s).

RECENT FINDINGS: Intussusception and intestinal malrotation  are potentially serious causes of intestinal obstruction, which are best  evaluated by ultrasound and upper gastrointestinal series, respectively.  Ultrasound has diagnostic importance in the evaluation of multiple diseases,  including appendicitis, by potentially decreasing the need for inpatient  observation, cholecystitis and complications of gall stones such as pancreatitis,  and ovarian diseases. Pelvic inflammatory disease should be considered in  evaluation of a teenage girl with lower abdominal pain. Less common causes of  acute abdominal pain include ingested foreign bodies, infected congenital  anomalies, and perforated peptic ulcer disease. SUMMARY: Presenting symptoms and  physical examination findings can narrow the number of potential diagnoses in  pediatric acute abdominal pain and thereby guide diagnostic imaging selection.  Abdominal/pelvic ultrasound, rather than computed tomography scan, is the  preferred modality for initial evaluation of many potential causes of pediatric  abdominal pain.","2012-06","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","357-364","","3","24","","Curr Opin Pediatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 22450248","","","","Humans; Female; Child; Diagnosis, Differential; Ultrasonography; Abdomen, Acute/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/surgery; Appendicitis/diagnosis/surgery; Intestinal Obstruction/complications/diagnosis/surgery; Pelvic Inflammatory Disease/complications/diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Paediatric GI endoscopy is a core competency every paediatric  gastroenterologist should possess, and represents one of the most common  procedures performed in children for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.  Yet there remains a dearth of literature on the utility and outcomes of  paediatric GI endoscopy in the Asia-Pacific region. Data on the diagnostic value  of paediatric GI endoscopy would be an important aspect of discussion, with the  emergence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and eosinophilic GI disease as  increasingly common endoscopic diagnoses. Time-based trends in paediatric GI  endoscopy do point towards more IBD and gastroesophageal reflux disease-related  complications being diagnosed, with a declining incidence of GI bleeding.  However, the real-world diagnostic value of endoscopy in Asia must be  contextualised to the region-specific prevalence of paediatric GI diseases.  Helicobacter pylori infection, particularly that of multidrug-resistant strains,  remains a highly prevalent problem in specific regions. Paediatric functional GI  disorders still account for the majority of childhood GI complaints in most  centres, hence the diagnostic yield of endoscopy should be critically evaluated  in the absence of alarm symptoms. GI therapeutic endoscopy is also occasionally  required for children with ingested foreign bodies, intestinal polyposis or  oesophageal strictures requiring dilation. Endoscopic haemostasis is a  potentially life-saving skill in cases of massive GI bleeding typically from  varices or peptic ulcers. Advanced endoscopic techniques such as capsule  endoscopy and balloon-assisted enteroscopy have found traction, particularly in  East Asian centres, as invaluable diagnostic and therapeutic tools in the  management of IBD, obscure GI bleeding and intestinal polyposis. State of the art  endoscopic diagnostics and therapeutics, including the use of artificial  intelligence-aided endoscopy algorithms, real-time confocal laser endomicroscopy  and peroral endoscopic myotomy, are expected to gain more utility in paediatrics.  As paediatric gastroenterology matures as a subspecialty in Asia, it is essential  current paediatric endoscopists and future trainees adhere to minimum practice  standards, and keep abreast of the evolving trends in the diagnostic and  therapeutic value of endoscopy. This review discusses the available published  literature on the utility of paediatric GI endoscopy in Asia Pacific, with the  relevant clinical outcomes.","2023-05-14","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","2717-2732","","18","29","","World J Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","eng","©The Author(s) 2023.

Pediatric emergency physicians and gastroenterologists often  encounter nervous and distressed situations, because of children presenting with  this condition in the common clinical practice. When determining the appropriate  timing and indications for intervention, physicians should consider multiple  patient- and FB-related factors. The utilization of a flexible endoscopy is  considered safe and effective to use in these cases, with a high success rate,  for the effective extraction of FBs from the gastrointestinal tract of a child.  Additionally, a Foley catheter and a magnet-attached Levin tube have been used  for decades in the case of FB removal. Although their use has decreased  significantly in recent times, these instruments continue to be used for several  indications. Using a Foley catheter for this purpose does not require special  training and does not necessarily require sedation of the patient or fluoroscopy,  which serve as advantages of utilizing this method for foreign object retrieval.  An ingested magnet or iron-containing FB can be retrieved using a magnet-attached  tube, and can be effective to retrieve an object from any section of the upper  gastrointestinal tract that can be reached. Simple and inexpensive devices such  as Foley catheters and magnet-attached tubes can be used in emergencies such as  with the esophageal impaction of disk batteries if endoscopy cannot be performed  immediately (e.g., in rural areas and/or in patients presenting at midnight in a  facility, especially in those without access to endoscopes or emergency services,  or in any situation that warrants urgent removal of a foreign object).","2019-03","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","132-141","","2","22","","Pediatr Gastroenterol Hepatol Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Korea (South) PMID: 30899689  PMCID: PMC6416381","","","","Esophagus; Children; Endoscopy; Foreign bodies; Magnets; Foley catheterization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Delay in their diagnosis and treatment may  significantly increase morbidity and mortality. Causes of esophageal injury  include iatrogenic (including esophagogastroduodenoscopy and stent placement),  foreign body ingestion, blunt or penetrating trauma to the chest or abdomen, and  forceful retching, also called Boerhaave syndrome. Although fluoroscopic  esophagography remains the imaging study of choice according the American College  of Radiology appropriateness criteria, CT esophagography has been shown to be at  least equal to if not superior to fluoroscopic evaluation for esophageal injury.  In addition, CT esophagography allows diagnosis of extraesophageal abnormalities,  both as the cause of the patient's symptoms as well as incidental findings. CT  esophagography also allows rapid diagnosis since the examination can be readily  performed in most clinical settings and requires no direct radiologist  supervision, requiring only properly trained technologists and a CT scanner.  Multiple prior studies have shown the limited utility of fluoroscopic  esophagography after a negative chest CT scan and the increase in accuracy after  adding oral contrast agent to CT examinations, although there is considerable  variability of CT esophagography protocols among institutions. Development of a  CT esophagography program, utilizing a well-defined protocol with input from  staff from the radiology, gastroenterology, emergency, and general surgery  departments, can facilitate more rapid diagnosis and patient care, especially in  overnight and emergency settings. The purpose of this article is to familiarize  radiologists with CT esophagography techniques and imaging findings of emergent  esophageal conditions.

RECENT FINDINGS: Foreign body  ingestion (FBI) is a problem that is frequently encountered by pediatric  providers. As new toys and products enter the marketplace, there may also be new  dangers from those objects not initially recognized. Some of the recent trends  and findings in pediatric FBI include an increase in adolescent injury from  ingestion of laundry detergent pods because of a popular game where participants  are encouraged to bite or swallow the pods, and injuries associated with  ingesting parts of a popular toy known as a 'Fidget Spinner'. SUMMARY: Adverse  events resulting from FBI range the entire gamut from nonexistent or minor  symptoms to moderate injury and rarely may be fatal. Factors such as age, type of  object ingested, anatomic location of the foreign body, and timing from ingestion  to receipt of medical attention all determine the risk posed to the child and  guide management decisions. Because of the constant development of products, and  the potential for the emergence of new and dangerous trends among children,  continued surveillance by the medical community is important in monitoring and  managing injuries associated with FBI.","2018-10","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","677-682","","5","30","","Curr Opin Pediatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 30036203","","","","Humans; Child; Pediatrics; Child, Preschool; Infant; Play and Playthings; Endoscopy; Eating; *Emergency Medical Services; Burns, Chemical/*diagnostic imaging/etiology/physiopathology; Child Behavior; Consumer Product Safety/*standards; Detergents/toxicity; Digestive System/*diagnostic imaging/injuries; Electrical Equipment and Supplies/adverse effects; Esophageal Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/etiology/physiopathology; Foreign Bodies/complications/*diagnostic imaging/therapy; Laundering; Needlestick Injuries/*diagnostic imaging/etiology/physiopathology; Product Packaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some foreign objects  (eg, an object that has been swallowed either intentionally or unintentionally)  are the cause of the patient's signs and symptoms and require prompt medical  attention. Other objects, such as a sponge or surgical instrument that has been  retained postoperatively, may have medicolegal consequences. Furthermore, certain  objects, such as intentionally concealed drug packets, may go undetected unless a  high degree of suspicion exists and appropriate window settings are used to  review the study. The radiologist should be familiar with the wide range of  foreign objects that may be encountered at abdominopelvic CT, be able to  recognize them promptly, and understand their implications for patient treatment.","2011-04","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","409-428","","2","31","","Radiographics","","","","","","","","eng","© RSNA, 2011.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 21415187","","","","Humans; Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods; Radiography, Abdominal/*methods; Abdominal Injuries/*diagnostic imaging; Foreign Bodies/*diagnostic imaging; Radiographic Image Enhancement/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In adults, a large variety of  foreign bodies are accidentally or intentionally ingested, inserted or aspirated.  In the majority of cases, the objects are expelled conservatively by coughing,  vomiting or bowel movements. The risk for obstruction, perforation and  penetration depends upon the type of object, those with sharp edges or tips  having the highest risk. In these situations, the objects have to be removed by  an endoscopic or an operative intervention. We present four foreign body stories  including a young lady who swallowed a pen during sleep, a farmer who inserted a  corncob into the rectum because of intractable diarrhoea, an elderly gentleman  who aspirated a dental bridge while laughing and a cocain body packer who was  caught at the border.

Anaesthesiologists would be more and more confronted to patient with tattooing or piercing, or both.  This review discusses the anaesthetic potential risks and complications observed  with tattooing and piercing, their management and prevention. RECENT FINDINGS:  Airway management during anaesthesia is of particular interest with oral jewelry.  Patients often refuse to remove their piercing for fear of tract closure. There  are no serious complications reported after epidural puncture through a tattoo,  although any long-term consequence cannot be discarded yet. Even theoretical  concerns are more and more debated. SUMMARY: Oral and nasal piercing is of  particular concern because of the risks of swallowing and aspiration.  Consequently, patients should be advised to remove piercing before anaesthesia.  Emergency situations are especially risky and anaesthesiologists should be aware  of the piercing removal techniques. In case of piercing loss, radiographies and  fiberoptic endoscopy of the upper airways and digestive tracts should be  performed to eliminate aspiration or swallowing of the foreign body. Epidurals  should not be denied to parturients with lumbar tattooing. However, it seems  still prudent to avoid direct tattoo puncture or when unavoidable, to nick the  skin prior to inserting the needle through the tattoo.","2009-06","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","436-441","","3","22","","Curr Opin Anaesthesiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19384230","","","","Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Anesthesia, Obstetrical; Anesthesia/*adverse effects; Body Piercing/*adverse effects; Mouth; Nose; Tattooing/*adverse effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Radiological examinations play a crucial role in  determining the exact location of the object within the gastrointestinal tract  and in planning for its removal by endoscopic or surgical intervention. METHODS:  Medical and radiological records of 8 patients who had swallowed the broken heads  or entire toothbrush were retrospectively reviewed. This series included 4 men  and 4 women, ranging in age from 21 to 57 years (mean: 34 years). RESULTS:  Radiographs and computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated the ingested  toothbrushes within the stomach in 3, lodged in the duodenum in 1, and entrapped  in various parts of the colon in 4 patients. They were removed by laparotomy in  3, laparoscopy in 2, colonoscopy in 2, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in 1  patient. There were no perforations or associated complications, and all patients  had uneventful recoveries. CONCLUSIONS: Ingested toothbrushes can be easily  identified on radiological studies because of the radiopaque wires holding the  nylon bristles. The plastic parts of it, however, are only visible on computed  tomography. All cases would require endoscopic or surgical removal of the  retained toothbrushes because spontaneous passage per rectum does not occur.","2022-04","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","377-382","","2","29","","Emerg Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

This study was undertaken in order to better define  clinical patterns of IIFO among prisoners. We sought to determine factors  associated with the need for endoscopic and surgical therapy for IIFO. METHODS:  After obtaining permission to conduct IIFO research in incarcerated populations,  study patients were identified by ICD-9 codes. Patient charts were reviewed for  demographics; past medical history; IIFO characteristics; and diagnostic,  endoscopic, and surgical findings. Univariate and multivariate analyses were  performed using statistical software. RESULTS: Thirty patients with 141 episodes  of IIFO were identified. The mean number of ingested items per episode was 4.60.  Endoscopy was performed in 97 of 141 IIFO instances, with failure to retrieve the  ingested object in 21 of 97 cases (22%). Eleven instances (7.8%) required  surgical intervention. On multivariate analyses, hospital admission was  associated with elevated white blood cell count (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, P < 0.05)  and number of items ingested (OR 1.3, P < 0.05). The need for endoscopy was  independently associated with ingestion of multiple objects (OR 3.3, P < 0.05)  and elevated white blood cell count (OR 1.3, P < 0.05). Surgical therapy was  significantly associated with elevated white blood cell count (OR 1.6, P < 0.01)  and with increasing number of ingested items (OR 1.07 per item, P < 0.05).  Endoscopy is associated with significantly lower odds of surgery (OR 0.13,  P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Intentional ingestion of foreign objects continues to  pose a significant human and economic burden. The need for admission or therapy  is frequently associated with leukocytosis. Further investigation is warranted  into resource-appropriate triage of patients who present with IIFO.","2013-09","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","145-149","","1","184","","J Surg Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: Adult patients with an  endoscopic record of attempted foreign body retrieval between January 2013 and  September 2020 were identified at three Australian hospitals. Those with a  documented mental health diagnosis were included and their standard medical  records reviewed. Presentation history, demographics, comorbidities and  endoscopic findings were recorded and described. RESULTS: A total of 166  admissions were accounted for by 35 patients, 2/3 of which had borderline  personality disorder (BPD). Repetitive presentations occurred in more than half  of the cohort. There was an increased trend of hospital admissions throughout the  years. At least half of the cohort had a documented mental health review during  their admission. An average of 3.3 (2.9) foreign bodies were ingested per single  episode. Endoscopic intervention was performed in 76.5% of incidents. The  combined Length of stay for all patients was 680 days.

Incidents  often involve ingestion of small metal objects (e.g., paperclips, razor blades)  or other commonly available items like pens or eating utensils. Despite ingestion  of relatively sharp objects, most episodes can be clinically managed with either  observation or endoscopy. Surgery should be reserved for those with signs or  symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or obstruction. For those with a history  of IIFO, efforts should focus on prevention of recurrence as subsequent episodes  are associated with higher morbidity, significant healthcare and security costs.  The pattern of IIFO is often repetitive, with escalation both in frequency of  ingestions and in number of items ingested. Little is known about successful  prevention strategies, but efforts to monitor patients and provide psychiatric  care are potential best-practice strategies.

We implemented a Foreign Body Algorithm  (FBA) designed to delay all but the most urgent endoscopy for EFI and FBI until  regular working hours. METHODS: Using endoscopy records from multiple academic  and community hospitals within a large integrated health system in the United  states, we identified esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) performed for food  impactions and foreign body ingestions occurring between May 2011 and February  2021. RESULTS: We identified 479 EGDs performed for FBI and EFI. The introduction  of the FBA was associated with a shorter length of stay (LOS) for overall cases  (0.35 vs. 0.8 d P <0.001), day cases (0.16 vs. 1.0 d P <0.001), and night cases  (0.40 vs. 0.6 d P =0.03). The introduction of the FBA did not change the rate of  overall adverse events (AE) or night AE. AE from the entire cohort was rare (3%;  16 total). Of the AE, most were sedation related. The introduction of the FBA did  not affect the overall rate of night cases or AE, but the rate of after-hours  endoscopy for intentional ingestions decreased from 17.2% to 3.1% ( P =0.01).  CONCLUSION: This is one of the largest studies of esophageal impactions and  foreign bodies in adults in the United States, and the first to examine the  effects of a protocol designed to avoid after-hours endoscopy. These results  suggest that postponing after-hours EGD until the daytime is not associated with  adverse safety outcomes or increased LOS.","2023-10-01","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","890-894","","9","57","","J Clin Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Increasing prevalence of smaller, more technologically advanced toys  in the household has resulted in an increased exposure to higher voltage  batteries and powerful magnets that carry a high incidence of morbidity and  mortality. This review highlights the latest findings regarding the patients at  risk for button battery and magnet ingestions, the symptoms of presentation, and  complications of these objects in contributing to long-standing gastrointestinal  injury. RECENT FINDINGS: Button batteries may lead to esophageal injury within a  few hours. Batteries retained in the esophagus are larger in diameter on average  and size is associated with esophageal impaction as well as higher grade  esophageal injury. Magnet ingestions, when multiple or with another metallic  object, are often initially asymptomatic but may have acute worsening, and  therefore warrant close monitoring. SUMMARY: Button battery and magnet ingestions  have increased in incidence over the past two decades. Recent literature  demonstrates that higher voltage, larger lithium button batteries, and prevalence  of high-powered magnets can lead to significant morbidity. High suspicion, early  referral, and removal may lead to improved outcomes.","2018-10","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","653-659","","5","30","","Curr Opin Pediatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 30188872","","","","Humans; Child, Preschool; Play and Playthings; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Foreign Bodies/complications/*diagnostic imaging/surgery; Eating; Electric Power Supplies/*adverse effects; *Endoscopy, Digestive System; *Radiography; Burns, Chemical/*diagnostic imaging/*etiology; Esophagus/diagnostic imaging/injuries; Gastrointestinal Tract/diagnostic imaging/injuries; Magnets/*adverse effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, the frustrations among health care providers are  great, and the financial toll on health care is significant. Nevertheless, the  literature on DFBI is sparse, and suggestions for treatment planning and  management are limited. The authors sought to investigate and uncover efficacious  treatments and strategies for preventing reoccurrence in DFBI. We build on  earlier work by offering both broad and diagnosis-specific management strategies.  METHOD: A literature review was performed addressing the presentation, management  and prevention of reoccurrences of DFBI. Four cases of DFBI are presented  illustrating those psychiatric diagnoses (psychosis, malingering,  obsessive-compulsive disorder and borderline personality disorder) most  frequently encountered in hospital practice. Both broad and specific treatment  approaches are presented. RESULTS: Patients engaging in DFBI are best managed  through a multidisciplinary approach, following acute medical management.  Successful strategies for the prevention of reoccurrences of DFBI are  inconclusive. CONCLUSION: Understanding the function of this behavior is critical  in developing treatment for patients who engage in these dangerous, potentially  life-threatening, self-injurious behaviors.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the  potential value of computed tomography (CT) in guiding the selection of surgical  treatment for patients with ingested foreign bodies in the lower gastrointestinal  tract. METHODS: Between January 2014 and December 2023, we analyzed the data of  58 patients (median age: 65.4 years; range, 31-96 years) with ingested foreign  bodies in the lower gastrointestinal tract who underwent CT examinations.  Patients were treated either conservatively (35 cases) or surgically (23 cases).  The angle between the long axis of the foreign body and the intestinal canal  (FB-IC angle) was measured. CT findings and clinical variables were evaluated to  identify potential indicators for surgical treatment through univariate and  multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed  the FB-IC angle (P = 0.002), presence of free peritoneal gas (P = 0.002), white  blood cell count (P = 0.018), and neutrophil count (P = 0.007) as significant  factors associated with surgical treatment. Multivariate analysis demonstrated  that the FB-IC angle (odds ratio, 1.033; P = 0.045) and the presence of free  peritoneal gas (odds ratio, 41.335; P = 0.002) are independent indicators for  surgical management. The FB-IC angle showed an area under the receiver operating  characteristic curve of 0.755, with a cutoff value of 51.25 degrees. CONCLUSION:  The FB-IC angle and presence of free peritoneal gas serve as potential predictive  imaging markers for surgical intervention.","2024-11","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","3759-3767","","11","49","","Abdom Radiol (NY)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024.

We aimed to analyze the different etiologies and clinical characteristics of acute  non-traumatic colon perforation beyond the neonatal period and to identify  surgical management and outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective study included 18  patients admitted with acute colon perforation and who received surgical  treatment. RESULTS: Age of patients ranged between 1 month and 15 years. Five  patients swallowed foreign objects (two swallowed magnets), two had colon  perforation secondary to a malignant tumor (both colorectal adenocarcinoma) and  two were iatrogenic (one prior colonoscopy, one air enema for intussusception).  There was one perforation due to chemotherapy and Amyand's hernia respectively.  The remaining seven patients had unknown etiologies; five of them were diagnosed  with colitis. Fifteen (83.3 %) patients underwent open laparotomy, among which  four attempted laparoscopy first. Three (16.7 %) patients underwent laparoscopic  surgery. Fourteen (77.8 %) patients received simple suture repairs and four  (22.2 %) received colonic resections and anastomosis. Four (22.2 %) patients  received a protective diverting colostomy and three (16.7 %) received an  ileostomy.

The probability of injury occurrence is influenced by  agent, host and environmental factors. Studies of repeat injuries in childhood  therefore provide insight into factors in the epidemiological triad predisposing  children to injury. OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportion of children and the  factors associated with repeat presentations to the Red Cross War Memorial  Children's Hospital Trauma Unit (RCWMCH TU) in Cape Town, South Africa, for all  non-transport-related injuries in childhood. METHODS: This was a retrospective  cohort study using data from the RCWMCH TU. We included children aged 0 - 10  years with first presentation from January 1997 to June 2013 and followed up  until the earlier of age 13 years or June 2016. We assessed individual and  population-level factors associated with repeat injury using multilevel Poisson  regression analysis. Child dependency ratios were derived from the 2011 National  Census. RESULTS: Between 1997 and 2013, 72 490 children aged &lt;10 years (59%  male) presented to the RCWMCH TU for the first time with injuries. After the  initial injury, 9 417 (13%) presented with a repeat injury by 2016 and before age  13 years. After adjusting for health subdistrict, distance from RCWMCH TU and age  at first presentation, factors associated with reduced repeat presentation were  injury identified as due to abuse (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 0.6; 95%  confidence interval (CI) 0.4 - 0.7), fluid burn (aIRR 0.6; 95% CI 0.6 - 0.7),  foreign body ingestion (aIRR 0.7; 95% CI 0.7 - 0.9), and moderate and severe (v.  minor) initial injury (aIRR 0.9; 95% CI 0.8 - 0.9 and aIRR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6 - 0.8,  respectively), while boys were more likely to have repeat injury presentations  (aIRR 1.4; 95% CI 1.4 - 1.5). CONCLUSIONS: Repeat presentations were substantial  and associated with male gender. They occurred less commonly after fluid burn  injuries, foreign body ingestion and moderate to severe injuries. Children with  intentional injuries were also less likely to have a repeat presentation. Further  research is indicated for childhood injuries with greater propensity to repeat,  including non-height falls and sport-related injuries. Secondary injury  prevention education should not neglect patients with unintentional and minor  injuries. These results strengthen the hypothesis that injuries arise as a result  of sustained exposure to agent, host and environmental risk factors.","2020-11-27","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","1218-1225","","12","110","","S Afr Med J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: South Africa PMID: 33403969","","","","Humans; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Trauma Centers; Cohort Studies; Adolescent; Child; Risk Factors; Child, Preschool; Infant; Hospitals, Pediatric; Burns/*epidemiology; Child Abuse/*statistics & numerical data; Foreign Bodies/*epidemiology; Reinjuries/*epidemiology; South Africa/epidemiology; Wounds and Injuries/*epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This review provides an outline of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, management,  and anesthetic implications in children who have ingested a button battery.  SOURCE: A literature search was conducted in the United States National Library  of Medicine PubMed database using the terms ""button battery ingestion"" and  ""children' and ""removal"" and ""surgery"" and ""anesthesia"". Ninety-six articles  published in English were found from 1983-2017, and 62 of these articles were  incorporated into this review. Additionally, the Internet was searched with the  terms ""button battery ingestion and children"" to identify further entities,  organizations, and resources affiliated with button battery ingestion in  children. These additional sources were studied and included in this review.  PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Button batteries are ubiquitous in homes and electronic  devices. Since 2006, larger-diameter and higher-voltage batteries have become  available. These are more likely to become impacted in the esophagus after  ingestion and lead to an increase in severe morbidity and mortality due to  caustic tissue injury. Children at the highest risk for complications are those  under six years of age who have ingested batteries > 20 mm in diameter and  sustain prolonged esophageal impaction at the level of the aortic arch with the  negative pole oriented anteriorly.

History and physical examination are commonly not enough to diagnose a foreign  body ingestion; therefore, conventional radiography is routinely used to detect  them. Point-of-care ultrasound is widely used in the emergency department for  several diagnostic applications but there are few articles describing the  possibility to use point-of-care ultrasound to detect ingested foreign bodies,  and the necessary training to get competent in this application. The main  objective of this paper is to illustrate the use of point-of-care ultrasound  (POCUS) to detect ingested foreign bodies. The secondary objective is to describe  a limited training, necessary for emergency pediatricians, to obtain this skill.  METHODS: This is a case series of eight pediatric patients who presented to the  pediatric Emergency Department (ED), with suspected ingestion of FB, and were  assessed with POCUS. Physician sonographers were two pediatricians and three  residents in pediatrics working in two Italian Pediatric EDs. All sonographers  participated in a 2-day POCUS workshop which included the most common pediatric  POCUS applications. RESULTS: POCUS, performed by emergency pediatricians who  participated to a limited training, allowed to always identify the foreign bodies  ingested. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that an appropriate and limited training  allows pediatric emergency physicians to correctly identify foreign body in the  esophagus or stomach. Point-of-care ultrasound in foreign body ingestion in the  Emergency Department may allow to prioritize the escalation of care in children  and it can contribute to reduce the time to endoscopic management when needed.","2021-03","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","107-114","","1","24","","J Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 32212088  PMCID: PMC7925727","","","","Humans; Child; Emergency department; Ultrasonography; Point-of-care ultrasound; Foreign body; *Foreign Bodies/diagnostic imaging; *Point-of-Care Systems; Coin ingested; Esophagus/diagnostic imaging; Pediatricians","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical cases and  experience with body packers has increased since the first report appeared in  1971. These cases remain an uncommon cause of acute drug toxicity and/or bowel  obstruction. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 23 year-old man was brought to the emergency  department with seizures. CT imaging revealed numerous intestinal foreign bodies,  suspicious for body packing. The patient was stabilized and taken emergently to  the operating room for exploratory laparotomy and removal of 34 cocaine packets.  Ongoing treatment for cocaine overdose was also utilized. The patient recovered  without complications. DISCUSSION: This case provides insight and awareness for  proper diagnosis and management of body packers by physicians and surgeons alike.  CONCLUSION: We present a case report of acute cocaine intoxication in a young man  who ingested 34 packets of cocaine for means of drug trafficking. Medical  approaches are available for cases in which patients remain asymptomatic, but  surgical intervention is necessary for those with signs and symptoms of bowel  obstruction or drug overdose.","2019","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","84-87","","","55","","Int J Surg Case Rep","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Therefore, this  study compares the advantages and disadvantages of both endoscopic procedures  from a clinical perspective. METHODS: A retrospective review was made of 273  patients suspected of esophageal FBs in emergency consultations of a tertiary  medical referral center from March 2010 to March 2014. All patients received  routine physical examinations, otolaryngological examinations, and X-rays of the  neck and chest. The door-to-endoscopy time, procedure time, postendoscopic  hospital stay, successful removal rates, and complications were analyzed as well.  RESULTS: In this study, the most common esophageal FBs were fish and animal bones  (76%) in adults and coins (74%) in children. The patients with existing  esophageal FBs had significantly more frequent symptoms of dysphagia and signs of  linear opacity as detected with lateral neck radiography than those without FB.  Additionally, the door-to-endoscopy time, procedure time, and postendoscopic  hospital stay was significantly shorter in FE patients than in RE patients.  However, both RE and FE patients had high rates of successful FB removal (95%)  and low complication rates (2%). CONCLUSION: Both FE and RE remove esophageal FBs  successfully, as evidenced by their high success rates, low complication rates,  and high detection rates.

This review will focus on  the clinical presentation and complications of these two common inadvertent  ingestions in children, as well as recent regulatory efforts and advocacy  opportunities. RECENT FINDINGS: The rising incidence of cannabis toxicity in  children has corresponded with its legalization across several countries in the  last decade. Inadvertent pediatric cannabis intoxication is most commonly due to  the ingestion of edible forms discovered by children in their own home. The  clinical presentation can be nonspecific, therefore clinicians should have a low  threshold for including it on their differential diagnosis. Button battery  ingestions are also increasing in incidence. While many children are asymptomatic  at presentation, button battery ingestions can quickly cause esophageal injury  and lead to several serious and potentially life-threatening complications.  Prompt recognition and removal of esophageal button batteries is essential for  reducing harm. SUMMARY: Cannabis and button battery ingestions are important for  physicians who take care of children to recognize and manage appropriately. Given  their rising incidence, there are many opportunities for policy improvements and  advocacy efforts to make a difference in preventing these ingestions altogether.","2023-06-01","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","316-323","","3","35","","Curr Opin Pediatr","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, most dental treatment occurs outside of a hospital  setting; thus the time to respond to a life-threatening situation is crucial. The  aim of this study was to determine the frequency and characteristics of medical  emergencies that occurred at the Griffith University Dental Clinic over a 6-year  period. METHODS: Data involving medical emergencies was collected at a dental  school between January 2014 and December 2019. Data was obtained from the risk  incident reporting system (GSafe), and descriptive statistics were analyzed using  IBM SPSS. RESULTS: The frequency of medical emergencies in a dental setting over  the 6-year retrospective period based on the number of dental services provided  was 0.037% (n = 108). The three most common medical emergencies were syncope  (25.0%), hypoglycemia (16.7%), and foreign body ingestion (13.9%). These happened  more often during dental extractions (26.9%), followed by local anesthesia  (16.7%) and restorative procedures (13.0%). A larger portion of these incidents  occurred during dental treatment (62.0%) as opposed to before (12.0%) or after  (26.0%). Most medical emergencies happened within the dental student clinic  (72.2%) followed by the dental waiting room (19.5%) and dental private clinic  (8.3%). CONCLUSION: Overall, the number of medical emergencies at the Griffith  University Dental Clinic was low. The most common medical emergencies were  syncope, hypoglycemia, and foreign body ingestion. Dental education in  preventative strategies and training in basic life support is necessary to ensure  dental practitioners can manage the acute deterioration of a patient promptly.","2022-05","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","574-580","","5","86","","J Dent Educ","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 American Dental Education Association.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34962657","","","","Humans; Retrospective Studies; Emergencies; syncope; *Foreign Bodies; Australia; *Hypoglycemia; dental schools; Dentists; incident reports; medical emergencies; Professional Role; Schools, Dental; Syncope/epidemiology/etiology/therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article reports a  single surgeon's experience of endoscopic retrieval of foreign bodies from the  upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract. Methods A retrospective analysis of data of  all the patients who underwent endoscopic management for foreign body removal by  a single surgeon in a tertiary care hospital in southern India between 2015 and  2020 was conducted. Patient variables in terms of age, sex, type of foreign body,  its location in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the time between ingestion and  presentation, the time between presentation and endoscopy, treatment outcomes  were reviewed. Results A total of 97 patients were studied. The age range of the  patients studied was one month to 71 years. Males were predominant (n=64,  65.97%). The most common retrieved foreign body were coins (n=31, 31.9%). The  most common site of foreign body lodgment was the esophagus (n=75, 77.31%), with  the upper third esophagus (n=38; 39.37%) being the predominant site. The success  rate of endoscopic retrieval in our study was 97%. No procedure-related  complications were encountered in any patient. Endoscopic management failed in  two patients who ultimately required surgical intervention. Conclusion Endoscopic  retrieval of foreign bodies in the UGI tract is a safe and effective modality.  Early endoscopy in such patients avoids surgical intervention and reduces  morbidity.","2021-11","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","e19293","","11","13","","Cureus","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021, Sude et al.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34754707  PMCID: PMC8570916","","","","endoscopy; foreign body; ingested; retrieval; upper gi tract","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A PubMed and Google Scholar search  discovered a variety of case reports detailing various methods and indications  for endoscopic retrieval of right sided colonic foreign bodies. This case report  endeavors to supplement the literature so that guidelines can one day be  established for colonoscopic retrieval of right-sided foreign bodies. CASE  PRESENTATION: 36-year-old male prisoner swallowed 6.5 cm nail clippers with a  long-standing history of intentional foreign body ingestion (FBI) including  multiple laparotomies for foreign body retrievals. Computerized tomography (CT)  was used initially to confirm the position of the nail clippers. After almost two  weeks of failure of the foreign body (FB) to move beyond the caecum as  demonstrated on plain abdominal X-rays, the patient had a colonoscopy with  successful retrieval of the FB. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: This case report hopes to  encourage the consideration of colonoscopy for retrieval of right sided colonic  foreign bodies that have failed to pass on their own and where an operation may  come with increased risk (multiple laparotomies, multiple comorbidities, and  higher anaesthetic risk for a general anaesthetic). Colonoscopy/endoscopy still  has inherent risk and this patient did have an episode of temporary laryngospasm  that required intubation and monitoring in the intensive care unit post  operatively. Despite this the patient recovered and was discharged day one post  procedure without further complication. The case report has been reported in line  with the SCARE 2020 criteria (Agha et al., 2020 [2]). CONCLUSION: Indications for  consideration of endoscopic retrieval of foreign bodies in the right colon have  not been entirely detailed as endoscopy is for upper gastrointestinal foreign  bodies. This case report documents the indications for endoscopy in the clinical  context of a recurrent FBI and a history of multiple laparotomies with failure of  the FB to move beyond the caecum.","2022-01","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","106755","","","90","","Int J Surg Case Rep","","","","","","","","eng","Crown Copyright © 2022.

The aim was to assess the impact on services and to identify ways to safely  mitigate against this clinical challenge. DESIGN/METHOD: We performed a  retrospective observational study of all patients presenting to a university  hospital between January 2015 and April 2020 with iFoBI with a focus on objects  swallowed, timing of endoscopy and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: 239 episodes of  iFoBI in 51 individuals were recorded with a significant increase in incidence  throughout the study period (Welch (5, 17.3)=15.1, p<0.001), imposing a high  burden on staff and resources. Items lodged in the oesophagus were more likely to  lead to mucosal injury (p=0.009) compared with elsewhere. Ingested item type and  timing of endoscopy were not related to complications (p=0.78) or length of stay  (p=0.8). In 12% of cases, no objects were seen at endoscopy. CONCLUSION: In all  except those patients with oesophageal impaction of the object on radiograph,  there is no need to perform endoscopic extraction out of hours. A subset of cases  can avoid endoscopy with an X-ray immediately prior to the procedure as a  significant proportion have passed already. We discuss more holistic approaches  to deal with recurrent attendances.","2022","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","98-103","","2","13","","Frontline Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","eng","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Our study aimed to compare the prevalence of  different age, gender, types, locations and management of FB ingested between  intentional ingestion and accidental ingestion of FB in Northern China. METHODS:  A retrospective case series studied all patients with suspected FB ingestion in  Digestive Endoscopy Center of Beijing Friendship Hospital, between January 2011  and January 2019. The patients were divided into 2 groups. Group A included the  patients who intentionally ingested FBs, and Group B included the patients who  accidentally ingested FBs. Patients' database (demographics, past medical  history, characteristics of FB, endoscopic findings and treatments) were  reviewed. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software. RESULTS: Group  A consisted of 77 prisoners, 2 suspects and 11 psychologically disabled persons.  Group B consisted of 1020 patients with no prisoners, suspects or psychologically  disabled persons. In Group A, there were no food-related foreign bodies, and the  majority of FBs were metallic objects (54.44%). However in Group B, food-related  FBs were the most common (91.37%). In Group A, 58 cases (64.44%) were located in  the stomach, while in Group B, 893 cases (87.55%) were located in the esophagus  (P < 0.05). 1096 patients successfully underwent endoscopic removal and 14  failed, including 9 cases in Group A and 5 cases in Group B. The duration of FBs  impaction was longer in Group A than that in Group B (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In  our study, the patients who intentionally ingested FB were mainly prisoners, FBs  were mostly sharp metallic objects, the duration of FBs impaction was longer, and  the rate of successful endoscopic treatment was lower than that of the general  population. Attention should be focused on these patients.","2020-04-06","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","90","","1","20","","BMC Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32252651  PMCID: PMC7137476","","","","Humans; Adult; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult; Comorbidity; Foreign body; Endoscopy; *Esophagus; Intentional ingestion; *Duodenum; *Stomach; Accidents/*statistics & numerical data; Age Distribution; China/epidemiology; Diverticulum, Esophageal/epidemiology; Eating; Endoscopy, Digestive System; Esophageal Neoplasms/epidemiology; Esophageal Stenosis/epidemiology; Food; Foreign Bodies/*epidemiology/surgery; Intention; Mentally Ill Persons/*statistics & numerical data; Metals; Prisoners/*statistics & numerical data; Sex Distribution; Upper gastrointestinal tract","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both rigid (RE) and flexible (FE) endoscopic techniques are used for  removal of esophageal FBs; however, there is no consensus amongst pediatric  surgeons regarding the best method. This study reviewed our experience managing  esophageal FBs using both techniques. METHODS: A 12-year retrospective review of  children admitted with an esophageal FB between 1999 and 2012 was undertaken.  Clinical data, management techniques, and complications were abstracted.  Differences between these two groups were compared with standard statistical  methods. RESULTS: 657 children were treated for esophageal FB ingestion, of which  366 (56%) were treated with FE. The most frequently ingested item was a coin  (84%), and FBs were most commonly lodged in the upper third of the esophagus  (78%). There was a slightly younger population in the FE group (4.0 vs. 3.3  years, p < 0.01), but otherwise no significant differences were found between the  groups. The FB was successfully removed with the initially chosen technique in  97% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal FBs may be successfully removed with  either RE or FE. Since treatment failures were managed with conversion to the  other technique, both procedures should be included in the training curriculum.","2014-04","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","417-422","","4","30","","Pediatr Surg Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 24549805","","","","Humans; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Adolescent; Child; Young Adult; Child, Preschool; Infant; *Esophagus; Foreign Bodies/*surgery; *Esophagoscopes; *Esophagoscopy; Equipment Design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, recurrent and intentional FBI (RIFBI) is  infrequent and associated with greater endoscopic and surgical intervention in  adults. Although pediatric guidelines exist for FBI, the risk and therapeutic  implications of RIFBI are not addressed. An anonymous international survey on  pediatric gastroenterologist experience with RIFBI was distributed. METHODS: A  33-item REDCap© survey was distributed via email to pediatric gastroenterologists  identified through mailing and email lists obtained from pediatric  gastroenterology professional organizations. RESULTS: During 9-12/2021 we accrued  202 completed surveys. Respondents were from 27 countries and across the career  span. Eighty percent reported experience with RIFBI; 74% reported seeing ≤ 3  patients with RIFBI within the past 24 months and 4% reported seeing ≥ 6. Of  those who treated RIFBI, 38% reported an average number of annual ingestions per  patient was ≥5. Frequent morbidity but not mortality was reported. Half reported  adherence to FBI guidelines. Later-career endoscopists treated RIFBI more  aggressively than accidental ingestion. Ninety-six percent noted that patients  with RIFBI had psychiatric comorbidities. Providers at academic medical centers  reported referring to behavioral health more than those in other settings.  CONCLUSION: Most gastroenterologists surveyed reported encountering RFBI several  times a year and in patients with psychiatric comorbidities. Greater likelihood  of adverse outcomes associated with endoscopy was reported. Most reported  referral to behavioral health and few had RIFBI management protocols. A broader  spectrum of psychologic comorbidities in the pediatric population with RIFBI,  notably depression and autism spectrum disorder, were reported.","2024-03","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","711-719","","3","78","","J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024 European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and  Nutrition.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38284750","","","","Humans; Adult; Child; endoscopy; Eating; Digestive System; foreign body; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal; *Foreign Bodies/surgery/complications; *Autism Spectrum Disorder/complications; behavioral health; multidisciplinary collaboration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Patients admitted with ingested  foreign bodies were identified in the Kids' Inpatient Database (1997-2009).  RESULTS: Overall, 7480 cases were identified. Patients were most commonly <5years  of age (44%), male (54%), and Caucasian (57%). A total of 2506 procedures were  performed, GI surgical procedures (57%) most frequently, followed by GI endoscopy  (24%), esophagoscopy (11%), and bronchoscopy - in cases of inhaled objects (9%).  On multivariate analysis, length of stay increased when cases were associated  with intestinal obstruction (OR=1.7), esophageal perforation (OR=40.0),  intestinal perforation (OR=4.4), exploratory laparotomy (OR=1.9), and gastric  (OR=2.9), small bowel (OR=1.5), or colon surgery (OR=2.5), all p<0.02.

We contribute to this existing controversy by presenting a case of a  43-year-old male who accidently ingested a metallic screw and was managed  successfully through endoscopic retrieval. CASE PRESENTATION: We discuss a case  of a 43-year-old male presented to our emergency department after accidently  swallowing a metallic screw, 1 h and a half prior to his presentation. He was  initially asymptomatic then started to complain of vague abdominal symptoms.  X-rays of the chest and abdomen demonstrated the presence of a metallic screw at  the mid-abdomen. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen then confirmed its  presence within the gastric lumen, with no evidence of gastric or bowel  perforation. The patient was managed via esophagogastroduodenoscopy in which the  ingested screw was extracted. He was discharged after 24 hours in a good  condition. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: A limited number of epidemiological studies have  shed light on the prevalence and incidence of foreign body ingestion among adult  individuals. Probability of spontaneous passage depends on several factors  including the size, shape and composition of the impacted item, as well as the  age of patient and duration of ingestion prior to presentation. CONCLUSION:  Considering the variation of ingested objects and the availability of several  therapeutic approaches, a patient-tailored management plan should always be  established.","2022-12","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","104944","","","84","","Ann Med Surg (Lond)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Authors.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36582912  PMCID: PMC9793207","","","","Case report; Foreign body ingestion; Computed tomography, (CT); Endoscopic retrieval; Screw ingestion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Medical records of 74  pediatric patients from 9 large Chinese hospitals during the past 10 years, who  were diagnosed as buckyball magnets ingestion and got invasive treatment, were  retrospectively studied. The follow-up was through telephone and outpatient  service to estimate the post-surgery condition. Information collection was  through online questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the 74 cases, there were 50 boys  (68%) and 24 girls (32%). The median age was 36 (interquartile range (IQR) 22-77)  months, with a range of 7 months to 11 years, and it showed two peaks, the first  between 1 and 3 years, and the second between 6 to 11 years. The annual case  number showed a sharp increase over time, and the total case number in the last  2 years (2017 and 2018) showed a greater than 9-fold increase when compared with  the first 2 years (2013 and 2014). The majority of ingestions were unintentional,  with only 3 patients deliberately swallowing the Buckyball magnets. The median  time of ingestion until the onset of emergent symptoms was 2 (IQR 1-5) days, and  ranged from 4 h to 40 days. Twenty-one patients had no symptoms, and the  remaining cases presented with abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, abdominal  distension, excessive crying, melena, and the ceasing of flatus and defecation.  Gastroscopy, colonoscopy, laparoscopic surgery and laparotomy surgery were  performed in accordance with the algorithm from the North American Society of  Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN). Procedural and  operative findings included gastrointestinal mucosa erosion, ischemia and  necrosis, perforation, and abdominal abscess, fistula and intestinal obstruction.  The median number of Buckyball magnets ingested was 4 (IQR 2-8), with a range  from 1 to 39. During the median follow-up period of 6 (IQR 1-15) months, 3  patients had intestinal obstruction, and one underwent a second operation. The  remaining 71 patients courses were uneventful during the follow-up period. None  of the 74 patients reported a second swallowing of foreign bodies. CONCLUSIONS:  The incidence of pediatric gastrointestinal tract magnets ingestion in China is  increasing. Management of such patients should follow the NASPGHAN algorithm.  Preventive measures to limit children's access to Buckyball magnets should be  taken from three levels, namely the national administration, producer, and  consumer.","2020-02-28","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","95","","1","20","","BMC Pediatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32111182  PMCID: PMC7049183","","","","Humans; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Child; Pediatric; Child, Preschool; Infant; Gastrointestinal Tract; China/epidemiology; Eating; *Foreign Bodies/diagnosis/epidemiology/surgery; *Magnets; Buckyball; Gastrointestinal tract; Magnetic foreign body","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Between January 1998 and December 2001, 80 patients with foreign body  ingestion were included and divided into two groups. Specifically, group 1  patients were managed nonoperatively, and group 2 patients were managed  operatively. The patient demographics, symptoms, foreign body ingestion  mechanisms, type of diagnostic studies and management, and outcomes were compared  between the two groups.

Most of the ingested  foreign bodies in group 1 were in the esophagus and stomach, but for group 2  patients they were mostly in the small bowel. Moreover, most of group 1 patients  were asymptomatic, which was not the case in group 2. Most group 2 patients had  no known history of foreign body ingestion, and diagnoses generally were  established during surgery. Neither group of patients displayed any mortality.

Therefore,  studies may not draw generalizable conclusions. Furthermore, data regarding FBIs  management in Europe are limited and outdated. This study aimed to analyze the  endoscopic management and outcomes of FBIs in an Italian tertiary care hospital  to identify risk factors for endoscopic failure. METHODS: We retrospectively  reviewed patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for FBIs between  2007 and 2017. Baseline, clinical, FBIs, and endoscopic characteristics and  outcomes were collected and reported using descriptive statistics and logistic  regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 381 endoscopies for FBIs, 288 (75.5%) were  emergent endoscopy and 135 (35,4%) included underlying upper gastrointestinal  conditions. The study population included 44 pediatric patients (11.5%), 54  prisoners (15.8%), and 283 adults (74.2%). The most common type and location of  FBIs were food boluses (52.9%) and upper esophagus (36.5%), respectively. While  eight patients (2.1%) developed major adverse events requiring hospital  admission, the remainder (97.9%) were discharged after observation. No mortality  occurred. Endoscopic success was achieved in 263 of 286 (91.9%) verified FBIs  endoscopies. Endoscopic failure (8.04%) was associated with age, bone, disk  battery, intentional ingestion, razor blade, prisoners, and stomach in the  univariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that intentional  ingestion was associated with endoscopic failure (odds ratio: 7.31; 95%  confidence interval = 2.06-25.99; P  = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Endoscopy for FBIs is  safe and successful, with low hospital admission rate in children, prisoners, and  adults.

METHOD: Five primary caregivers of children  with a history of dysphagia and/or feeding difficulties post-ingestion injury (4  chemical, 1 button battery) completed the Children's Picky Eating Questionnaire  (CPEQ), and participated in a semi-structured interview. Interviews explored  experiences of caring for a child with dysphagia and/or feeding difficulties,  impressions of services and supports, and additional impacts to the child and  family. Content analysis was used to identify key themes. RESULT: Primary  caregiver report and CPEQ results confirmed all children had some degree of  persisting dysphagia and/or feeding difficulties at time of interview (mean 4.13  years' post-injury). Interviews identified five key themes: 1) The initial trauma  of the injury, 2) The experience of associated and ongoing medical issues, 3)  Managing altered oral intake, 4) Experiences of services and support, and 5)  Impacts on the child, primary caregiver, and wider family unit. All caregivers  reported significant challenges and concerns, and potential areas of service  improvement were highlighted. CONCLUSION: The current data highlights specific  issues experienced by primary caregivers, and poses areas for improving primary  caregiver and family supports.

METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed. Patients were identified using  ICD-9 code for esophageal foreign body. Clinical data and management techniques,  along with complications were abstracted. RESULTS: For the 5-year period of  review, 255 patients were identified with an esophageal foreign body. 214  children had a witnessed ingestion. The mean age of the unwitnessed ingestion  group was 2.3 years, compared to 4.6 years for a witnessed ingestion. In both  groups, males and females were distributed equally and the most common ingested  object was a coin. Bivariate, unadjusted analysis revealed that history of wheeze  (OR, 4.35) and fever (OR, 11.15) had the largest association with patients who  had an unwitnessed ingestion. Multivariate analysis indicated that any physical  findings of wheeze, rhonchi, stridor, or retractions were associated  significantly with a diagnosis of an unwitnessed foreign body. Children less than  2 years of age and with a documented fever are also predictive of an unwitnessed  ingestion. Eleven children (4.3%) with esophageal abnormalities were also noted  to have foreign bodies. CONCLUSIONS: Children who present to the emergency  department two years old and younger, who have a documented fever and with  respiratory findings should be considered at risk for having a retained  esophageal foreign body. Children with esophageal abnormalities may also be at  risk for retained esophageal foreign bodies.","2005-09","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","582-585","","9","21","","Pediatr Emerg Care","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16160661","","","","Humans; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Adolescent; Child; Risk Factors; Child, Preschool; Infant; Comorbidity; *Esophagus; Age Distribution; Esophageal Stenosis/epidemiology; Sex Distribution; Multivariate Analysis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Food/statistics & numerical data; Foreign Bodies/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy; Fundoplication/statistics & numerical data; Household Articles/statistics & numerical data; Numismatics/statistics & numerical data; Philadelphia/epidemiology; Regression Analysis; Tracheoesophageal Fistula/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The nosological status and possible functions of this  behavior are discussed, as are the difficulties of caring for patients with such  long-standing, repeated selfinjury. This case illustrates how the boundaries  between different self-injurious behaviors are blurred and also how different  self-injurious behaviors are likely to share common patterns, functional  integrity, and meanings.

Herein, we address this need via the Appraisal  of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument. METHODS: A  literature search of Embase, MEDLINE via PubMed, and Scopus was performed up  until February 25, 2021. Identified CPGs were then assessed by four independent  reviewers trained in AGREE II. A scaled domain score of >60% was indicated as  satisfactory quality. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated  to assess inter-reviewer agreement. RESULTS: 11 guidelines were assessed with  only one being classified as high quality and others being either average (two)  or low quality (eight). Domain 4 (clarity of presentation) achieved the highest  mean score (66.41 ± 13.33%), while domain 5 (applicability) achieved the lowest  score (10.80 ± 10.37%). ICC analysis revealed generally strong agreement between  reviewers with a range of 0.60-0.98.

We studied the poorly  understood group of patients who intentionally ingest FBs. METHODS: Cases of  intentional ingestion of FBs (n = 305) were identified, retrospectively, from an  electronic endoscopy database and followed. Cases occurred among 33 different  patients, who underwent endoscopy from October 1, 2001, to July 31, 2009 (39.0  cases/year); 79% were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. Financial cost  analysis was performed using hospital billing and cost systems. RESULTS: Commonly  ingested FBs included pens (23.6%), batteries (9.2%), knives (7.2%), and razor  blades (6.9%). Most endoscopic procedures were performed under general  anesthesia. FBs were commonly retrieved by snares (58.0%), rat-toothed forceps  (14.4%), and nets (11.5%), assisted sometimes by use of overtubes (10.8%), and  hoods (4.6%). FB extraction was unsuccessful at the initial endoscopy in only 20  cases; 2 cases eventually required surgical extraction. Minor complications  occurred in 11 endoscopies. There were no deaths or perforations. The total  estimated costs were $2,018,073 ($1,500,627 in hospital costs, $240,640 in  physician fees, and $276,806 for security services). Costs were significantly  higher for inpatients. Major payers were Medicare (48%) and Medicaid (31%).  CONCLUSIONS: Intentional FB ingestion occurs among a relatively small number of  patients with psychiatric disorders and is costly. Endoscopic retrieval is  relatively effective and safe, but often requires general anesthesia. These cases  utilize significant hospital and fiscal resources. Attention should be focused on  preventing these recurrent and costly episodes.","2010-11","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","941-946","","11","8","","Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2010 AGA Institute.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 194 patients with a  diagnosis of foreign body impaction in the upper gastrointestinal tract,  confirmed by endoscopy, at two university hospital in South Korea. Patient  demographic data, including age, gender, intention to ingestion, symptoms at  admission, and comorbidities, were collected. Clinical features of the foreign  bodies, such as type, size, sharpness of edges, number, and location, were  analyzed. Endoscopic data those were analyzed included duration of foreign body  impaction, duration of endoscopic performance, endoscopic device, days of  hospitalization, complication rate, 30-d mortality rate, and the number of  operations related to foreign body removal. RESULTS: The types of upper  gastrointestinal foreign bodies included fish bones, drugs, shells, meat, metal,  and animal bones. The locations of impacted foreign bodies were the upper  esophagus (57.2%), mid esophagus (28.4%), stomach (10.8%), and lower esophagus  (3.6%). The median size of the foreign bodies was 26.2 ± 16.7 mm. Among 194  patients, endoscopic removal was achieved in 189, and complications developed in  51 patients (26.9%). Significant complications associated with foreign body  impaction and removal included deep lacerations with minor bleeding (n = 31,  16%), ulcer (n = 11, 5.7%), perforation (n = 3, 1.5%), and abscess (n = 1, 0.5%).  Four patients underwent operations because of incomplete endoscopic foreign body  extraction. In multivariate analyses, risk factors for endoscopic complications  and failure were sharpness (HR = 2.48, 95%CI: 1.07-5.72; P = 0.034) and a greater  than 12-h duration of impaction (HR = 2.42, 95%CI: 1.12-5.25, P = 0.025).  CONCLUSION: In cases of longer than 12 h since foreign body ingestion or  sharp-pointed objects, rapid endoscopic intervention should be provided in  patients with ingested foreign bodies.","2015-07-14","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","8125-8131","","26","21","","World J Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 26185385  PMCID: PMC4499356","","","","Humans; Adult; Aged; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Time Factors; Adolescent; Aged, 80 and over; Treatment Outcome; Child; Risk Factors; Young Adult; Emergency department; Chi-Square Distribution; Foreign body; Complication; Endoscopy; Upper gastrointestinal tract; Multivariate Analysis; Hospitals, University; Esophagoscopy/*adverse effects/mortality; Esophagus/pathology/*surgery; Foreign Bodies/diagnosis/mortality/*surgery; Gastroscopy/*adverse effects/mortality; Logistic Models; Medical Records; Odds Ratio; Postoperative Complications/etiology; Republic of Korea; Stomach/pathology/*surgery; Time-to-Treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Risk  factors for RIFB ingestion include male sex, incarceration, and the presence of a  psychiatric disorder. Most patients can be managed with observation and  endoscopy. Surgery is indicated in cases involving perforation or obstruction.  The literature on preventative strategies for RIFB ingestion is scarce. CASE  REPORT A 23-year-old man required 6 admissions in 1 calendar year for intentional  foreign body ingestions. The patient was living in prison and had a history of  bipolar I disorder, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. He  underwent 9 endoscopic procedures that retrieved a total of 64 objects. The  primary imaging modalities were abdominal X-ray and abdominopelvic  contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan. The patient was managed with  endoscopy and, in 2 cases, with observation alone. Serial abdominal examinations  and abdominal films were used to monitor the progress of foreign bodies that were  difficult to retrieve. A bowel regimen with polyethylene glycol facilitated the  passage of the objects. The patient never required surgical intervention. The  mean length of stay was 4.17 days. The recurrent ingestions may have been related  to compulsions and family stress. CONCLUSIONS Interdisciplinary collaboration is  paramount in formulating effective treatment plans and limiting recurrence.  Proposed strategies to prevent RIFB ingestion include the removal of ingestible  objects from the environment, specialized prison units for close monitoring,  early psychiatric intervention with appropriate pharmacologic/behavioral therapy,  and limiting hospital admissions to prevent secondary gain. Further studies are  needed to determine the most effective approach to manage and prevent RIFB  ingestion.","2021-11-15","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","e934164","","","22","","Am J Case Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34780394  PMCID: PMC8607049","","","","Humans; Adult; Male; Risk Factors; Young Adult; Endoscopy; Eating; *Foreign Bodies/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *Neoplasm Recurrence, Local","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unintentional foreign body ingestion commonly occurs accidentally in children aged between 3 months and 6 years and at advanced ages or results  from psychiatric disorders such as hallucination in patients with mental  retardation. Most of the ingested foreign bodies are naturally discharged from  the body but some of them may require surgical intervention. Presentation of  Case. A 29-year-old mentally retarded female patient was admitted to the  emergency service with a two-day history of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness, defense, and rebound on  palpation. Radiological examination revealed diffuse air-fluid levels and a  radiopaque impression of a metal object in the right upper quadrant. The metal  teaspoon causing ileal perforation was extracted by emergency laparotomy. On  postoperative day 7, the patient was uneventfully discharged following a  psychiatric consultation. Discussion. Foreign body ingestion can occur  intentionally in children at developing ages and old-age patients, or adults and  prisoners, whereas it may occur unintentionally in patients with mental  retardation due to hallucination. However, repeated foreign body ingestion is  very rare in individuals other than mentally retarded patients. Conclusion.  Mentally retarded patients should be kept under close surveillance by surgeons  and psychiatrists due to their tendency to ingest foreign bodies.","2016","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","8075432","","","2016","","Case Rep Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 27006854  PMCID: PMC4781951","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this survey was to collect data on experience  and opinions on the management of FBs in psychiatric patients with BPD and to  review the relevant literature. METHODS: A survey focusing on the indication and  the timing of endoscopy for sharp FB removal in patients with BPD was e-mailed to  215 gastroenterologists, psychiatrists, and surgeons in Switzerland, Germany and  Austria, discussing this clinical problem using a specific case vignette.  RESULTS: Responses were received from 63 of 215 (29%) contacted physicians.  Two-thirds of the respondents knew patients with BPD who had swallowed FBs  repeatedly; 86% recommended removing sharp FBs endoscopically even in the case of  repeated FB ingestion and 14% of respondents argued against emergent endoscopic  FB removal in the case of repeated ingestions. Different specialities expressed  partially divergent opinions regarding the management of these patients.  CONCLUSION: Repeated FB ingestions can be a problem in patients with BPD.  Although published data show that the perforation risk of unremoved FBs is low,  most clinicians support repeated endoscopies also in the case of repeated FB  ingestions. Nevertheless, in selected cases, repeated endoscopies need to be  discussed and an interdisciplinary consensus and/or the involvement of an ethical  committee is advised.","2012-07","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","793-797","","7","24","","Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 22562115","","","","Humans; Recurrence; Borderline Personality Disorder/*complications/psychology; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal/methods/*statistics & numerical data; Europe; Foreign Bodies/etiology/*surgery; Gastrointestinal Tract/injuries/*surgery; Health Care Surveys; Professional Practice/statistics & numerical data; Self-Injurious Behavior/etiology/*surgery; Wounds, Penetrating/etiology/prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mostly FBs are found ingested accidently or intentionally in children and adults with mental  status alterations. Depending on the type of object, different complications can  occur. There exist numerous methods for removing each specific FB. Fortunately,  most FBs tend to move uneventfully through the gastrointestinal tract without any  intervention; but managing some foreign objects can be difficult and lead to  severe complications. Endoscopy helps with the diagnosis and treatment of these  cases, but the time of the management plays an important role. CASE PRESENTATION:  A 26-year-old female who intentionally swallowed two sewing needles, presented to  our emergency department with abdominal pain two months after the FB ingestion.  One of the sewing needles was spontaneously excreted through the bowel, and the  other was present in her body for two months. The FB had penetrated the stomach  and migrated to the peritoneal cavity. The patient's condition was managed by  laparoscopic removal of the FB and repair of the damaged tissue. According to the  traumatic nature of the needle to abdominal viscera, and standing outside the GI  tract on the pancreas surface, laparoscopic removal of the foreign metallic body  was chosen to be performed. No complication was seen during the postoperative  period. CONCLUSION: This report emphasizes the importance of prompt evaluation of  FB patients and finding the appropriate method of managing its complications.  Preventing complications requires focusing on symptoms and instant management of  the ingested FBs.","2022-10","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","104747","","","82","","Ann Med Surg (Lond)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IJS Publishing Group Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36268315  PMCID: PMC9577834","","","","Laparoscopy; Case report; Foreign body","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although no data have been reported to support  a relationship between the gag reflex and dysphagia, the gag reflex is  nevertheless routinely assessed during the bedside dysphagia evaluation. The  purpose of the present study was to investigate whether absence of a gag reflex  is a predictor of dysphagia. METHOD: Fourteen consecutive adult subjects referred  for a bedside dysphagia evaluation because they were considered to be at  increased risk for aspiration, specifically due to absence of a gag reflex, were  investigated. In addition, the gag reflex was assessed in 69 normal adult  volunteers. RESULTS: Although all subjects were referred for bedside dysphagia  evaluations specifically because they had no gag reflex, 86% (12/14) were  nevertheless able to eat at least a puree diet. In addition, 86% (12/14) of  subjects with no gag reflex had normal velar movement, reinforcing the  physiologic differences between velar functioning during phonation and the gag  reflex. The gag reflex, traditionally considered part of the bedside dysphagia  evaluation, was absent in 13% (9/69) of nondysphagic subjects, raising further  doubts regarding its clinical relevancy. CONCLUSION: The absence of a gag reflex  does not appear to be a predictor of dysphagia.","1996-04","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","138-141","","2","18","","Head Neck","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8647679","","","","Humans; Adult; Aged; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Deglutition Disorders/*physiopathology; Gagging/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with a history of sharp or  pointed foreign body ingestion were reviewed retrospectively. Two observers  interpreted the CT and the conventional radiography datasets separately. If a  foreign body was directly identified, it was regarded as a positive finding. Even  if no high-density foreign body was found, detection of a secondary finding was  considered to be a positive finding. Diagnostic performance of MDCT and  conventional radiography were compared according to esophageal level. Final  diagnosis was made by esophagoscopy or surgery in addition to the  clinicoradiologic result. RESULTS: MDCT was statistically superior to  conventional radiography for diagnosis of a thoracic esophageal foreign body for  both observers (p < 0.001 for each). No significant difference in sensitivity  between CT and conventional radiography for diagnosis of cervical esophageal  foreign body was noted regardless of observer. Both observers could identify all  complicated conditions with MDCT regardless of esophageal level. However, in two  of three cases of complicated thoracic esophageal foreign bodies, neither  observer could detect foreign bodies on conventional radiography; furthermore,  the observers could not identify pneumomediastinum.

The most common lodged foreign body, requiring operative removal,  in the United States is the penny. Valued at 1 cent, comprised of materials  valued at less than 1 cent, costing 1.62 cents to manufacture, and being never  removed from circulation, pennies are aplenty. But ingestion can lead to mucosal  damage, the consequences of which can be esophageal perforation or stricture  formation. We hypothesize that the monetary value of the penny is far less than  the cost of its ingestion and removal. This quality assurance study examines the  effect of the penny on the purse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective review  identified 180 foreign bodies in children under the age of 18 over a five year  period. Eighty-two were pennies. Operative notes revealed degree of injury.  Hospital charge assessments revealed the ""cost"" of each visit. RESULTS: There  were no esophageal perforations, and cases were divided evenly among injury  grades 0-III. The average total charge for all penny-related injuries was  $7164.78. CONCLUSIONS: The purpose was to examine the actual cost of a penny  (more than its value in production) and the potential cost of its damage  (thousands of dollars in measurable costs, untold immeasurable costs). The goal  of this study is to draw healthcare professional and public attention to a  potentially serious and yet highly preventable injury in young children.","2011-12","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","1553-1557","","12","75","","Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol","","","","","","","","eng","Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","","","","","","Place: Ireland PMID: 21962948","","","","Humans; Retrospective Studies; United States; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Infant; Infant, Newborn; *Esophagus/injuries; Costs and Cost Analysis; Foreign Bodies/*economics/*surgery; Mucous Membrane/injuries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Children <18years  old who ingested a magnet were reviewed from 1/2011 to 6/2016 from two tertiary  center children's hospitals. Demographics, symptoms, management and outcomes were  analyzed. RESULTS: From 2011 to 2016, there were 89 magnet ingestions (50 from  hospital 1 and 39 from hospital 2); 50 (56%) were males. Median age was 7.9  (4.0-12.0) years; 60 (67%) presented with multiple magnets or a magnet and a  second metallic co-ingestion. Suspected locations found on imaging were: stomach  (53%), small bowel (38%), colon (23%) and esophagus (3%). Only 35 patients (39%)  presented with symptoms and the most common symptom was abdominal pain (33%). 42  (47%) patients underwent an intervention, in which 20 (23%) had an abdominal  operation. For those undergoing abdominal surgery, an exact logistic regression  model identified multiple magnets or a magnet and a second metallic object  co-ingestion (OR 12.9; 95% CI, 2.4 - Infinity) and abdominal pain (OR 13.0; 95%  CI, 3.2-67.8) as independent risk factors. CONCLUSION: Magnets have a high risk  of requiring surgical intervention for removal. Therefore, we developed a  management algorithm for magnet ingestion.

METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of 124 children aged from  1 month to 18 years who ingested batteries and were treated in a tertiary care  center from January 1, 2014 to March 31, 2019. The data studied included age,  sex, presenting symptoms at the time of evaluation, type and size of battery and  modality of management. RESULTS: Twenty-three (18.5%) patients ingested  cylindrical batteries (CBs), and 101 (81.5%) ingested BBs. The duration of  hospital stay was significantly longer (p = 0.004) in the group of children who  ingested BBs larger than 20 mm. Endoscopic removal was performed in 75 (60.5%)  children, 46 (37.1%) were followed up and three (2.4%) underwent open surgeries.  Children with CBs ingestion, in 55% of cases, had gastric mucosal injuries.  Children with BBs impacted in the esophagus in 96% cases had visible severe  mucosal damage, whereas patients with gastric BB ingestion 19.5% had superficial  gastric mucosal damage. CONCLUSION: Performing timely endoscopic retrieval in  children who are admitted early to the hospital will reduce the risk of damage to  the gastrointestinal mucosa, especially in the stomach. Unlike BBs, CBs, despite  their large size, have advantageous shapes, uneventfully pass the esophagus and  are more often retained in the stomach; thus, mucosal injuries are more often  observed in the stomach. Consequently, endoscopic extraction is the treatment of  choice for children with BB ingestion.","2021-10","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","1461-1466","","10","37","","Pediatr Surg Int","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

A minority of FB ingestions are  not identified for weeks to years and present significant problems for retrieval.  The purpose of this study was to describe the diagnostic and therapeutic  strategies needed to care for children who have chronic esophageal FBs. METHODS:  Five children were identified as having retained esophageal FBs 2 months to 2  years after ingestion. During the same 3-year period, 100 children who had acute  FBs were identified and had their foreign bodies removed endoscopically. The  average age of the children was 3 years (range, 2.4 to 3.5). RESULTS: The average  age of the five children identified in this study was 3 years. The items ingested  included coins, a heart pendant, a clothespin spring, and a toy soldier.  Complications from chronically retained foreign bodies were bronchoesophageal  fistula, mediastinitis, esophageal diverticulum, and lobar atelectasis. One  patient died from an aortoesophageal fistula. In all children, endoscopic removal  was attempted. Barium esophagram was then performed, and foreign bodies were  eventually removed via right thoracotomy. CONCLUSIONS: Long-retained esophageal  FBs are extremely morbid and life threatening. History most often identifies  excess salivation, new onset asthma, and/or recurrent upper respiratory  infections. Three diagnostic adjuncts are helpful in identifying the presence of  a long retained FB: (1) Chest x-ray (PA and lateral), (2) barium swallow, and (3)  esophagoscopy. Indications for thoracotomy for removal of foreign body include  (1) Poor endoscopic visualization of FB because of inflammatory tissue and (2)  Herald bleeding during endoscopy.","1997-10","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","1429-1431","","10","32","","J Pediatr Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9349761","","","","Humans; Retrospective Studies; Thoracotomy; Child, Preschool; Radiography; Endoscopy; Foreign Bodies/complications/*diagnostic imaging/surgery; Aorta, Thoracic; Bronchi; Esophagus/*diagnostic imaging/surgery; Fistula/etiology; Foreign-Body Migration; Mediastinitis/etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to describe characteristics of patients presenting with  suffocation injuries to emergency departments (EDs) in the United States (U.S.)  and to identify factors associated with mortality in this population. METHODS: We  conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study using the 2013 U.S National  Emergency Department Sample database. ED visits with primary diagnoses of  intentional or accidental suffocation injury, and injury by inhalation and  aspiration of foreign bodies or food (ICD-9-CM codes) were included. We performed  descriptive statistics to describe the study population. This was followed by  multivariate analyses to identify factors associated with mortality. RESULTS: We  included a total of 27,381 ED visits for suffocation injuries. Most suffered from  either inhalation and ingestion of food causing obstruction of respiratory tract  or suffocation (51.6%), or suicide and self-inflicted injury by hanging,  strangulation, and suffocation (39.4%). Overall mortality was 10.9%. Over half  (54.7%) of the patients were between 19 and 65 years old. Males were more common  than females (59.1% vs. 40.9%). Over half of the patients (54.9%) were treated  and released from the ED. Factors associated with increased mortality included  male gender, young age (4-18 years), diseases of the cardiac, respiratory,  genitourinary and neurologic systems, intentional self-harm, and self-payer  status. CONCLUSION: Mortality from suffocation injuries remains high with  significant burden on children and adolescents and on patients with intentional  injuries. Tailored initiatives targeting identified modifiable factors through  implementation of behavioral and environmental change can reduce the risk of  suffocation injury and improve clinical outcomes of affected victims.","2018-07","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","707-714","","4","19","","West J Emerg Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 30013708  PMCID: PMC6040911","","","","Humans; Adult; Retrospective Studies; United States; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Age Factors; Sex Factors; Adolescent; Child; Risk Factors; Child, Preschool; *Emergency Service, Hospital; Foreign Bodies; Cross-Sectional Studies; *Asphyxia/mortality/therapy; Self Mutilation/*psychology; Suicide/*psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Packets usually contain of opium, cocaine, cannabis  and amphetamines. The significant complications of body packing usually are  symptoms of drug toxicity due to leaking or ruptured packets or symptoms of  ingesting relatively large foreign bodies. Herein, we present a case of heroin  body-packing that resulted in subsequent bowel obstruction. CASE PRESENTATION: A  30-year-old male, who was brought from the prison to the emergency department,  complained of abdominal pain. After the absence of intoxication symptoms and  insignificant plain abdominal radiograph results, abdominal computed tomography  (CT) scan revealed the presence of ingested packets in the stomach as well as in  the patient's small intestine. Therefore, the decision of surgery was immediately  made for the patient, and during the surgery, the drug packets were entirely  removed. The patient was discharged in good general condition three days after  his surgery. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Body packers are in considerable risk as  rupture of packet inside the body and risk of obstruction that both of them may  be fatal. Patients should be monitored for complications, possible early  treatment, and removal or assistance in expulsion drug packets from the body.  Initially on plain abdominal radiographs, classic findings suggest the presence  of drug packets. CONCLUSION: In case of an inconclusive plain abdominal  radiograph, further investigation with CT is indicated, with an almost 100 %  sensitivity. For symptomatic patients, bowel obstruction and acute drug toxicity  are the two most common indications for surgical intervention.","2023-08","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","108503","","","109","","Int J Surg Case Rep","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023.

In this case study, we report a case of lanthanum ingestion resulting in imaging consistent with ingested  metallic foreign bodies. SUMMARY: Hyperphosphatemia affects most patients with  end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with morbidity and mortality.  Lanthanum carbonate reduces daily phosphate absorption and is indicated as a  non-calcium-based phosphate binder in patients with ESRD. A 58-year-old man with  a medical history of stage 5 chronic kidney disease was admitted to the intensive  care unit (ICU) for hyperkalemia and acute respiratory failure after a missed  dialysis session. He required vasopressors, intubation, and continuous renal  replacement therapy. Admission imaging demonstrated several ingested metallic  foreign bodies within the colon. There was consideration of colorectal surgery  and gastroenterology consultation. On the initial medication reconciliation, no  medications that would have the radiographic appearance of ingested metallic  foreign bodies were identified. On further review of prescription data available  through the electronic medical record, it was noted that the patient had recently  filled a prescription for lanthanum despite its apparent discontinuation on a  previous admission. After interviewing the patient's wife, it was confirmed that  the patient had continued taking lanthanum and that he was swallowing it whole  and not chewing it. No consultations or interventions were performed, and the  metallic foreign bodies were no longer present on further imaging after a period  of 35 days. CONCLUSION: Escalation of care was avoided in this patient due to the  performance of diligent medication reconciliation and recognition of the impact  of lanthanum ingestion on imaging.","2023-03-21","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","430-434","","7","80","","Am J Health Syst Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","© American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2022.

Diagnosis is typically made when there is a history of  ingestion coupled with corresponding radiographic verification. The symptoms tend  to be non-specific although some patients are able to delineate where the  discomfort level is, correlating with the site of impaction. Most foreign bodies  pass spontaneously; however when multiple sharp objects are ingested, the  gastroenterologist should perform endoscopic procedures to minimize the risks of  bowel perforation.

Most commonly, FB are introduced through the anal passage or  reach the rectum after oral ingestion. We describe our experience in the  diagnosis and treatment of FB retained in the rectum. METHOD: From 1997 to 2004,  data were collected prospectively in 30 patients (20 men and 10 women; median age  42.5 years). Extraction method, size and type of object, and postextraction  evolution were reviewed. RESULTS: The FB was introduced anally in 16 cases and by  oral ingestion in 14. Principal associated factors were: mental disorder in 11,  penitentiary confinement in two, and drug and alcohol intake in two. Recent  sexual activity had taken place in 14 cases. The size and nature of the FB were  varied. The most frequent symptom was constipation with or without pelvic or anal  discomfort (n = 23, 77%). Treatment consisted of spontaneous ejection (n = 2),  digital extraction with or without enemas (n = 10), digital extraction under  local/regional anaesthesia after fragmentation (n = 11) and regional exploratory  laparotomy under general anaesthesia (n = 7). Grade I rectal trauma was the most  common (n = 23, 77%). Six patients required colostomy. Four patients (13.5%)  suffered complications and none died. Only 17 patients were hospitalized, with a  mean stay of 6 days. All patients recovered without sequelae. CONCLUSION: The  diagnosis of rectal FB should be suspected when faced with low pelvic or perianal  abdominal pain and/or rectal haemorrhage within the context of an unconvincing  story in patients without a history of recent instrumental rectal exploration for  therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. Because of potential complications, FB in the  rectum should be considered a serious condition that must be treated without  delay.","2007-07","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","543-548","","6","9","","Colorectal Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 17573750","","","","Humans; Adult; Comorbidity; *Rectum; Alcoholism/epidemiology; Constipation/epidemiology; Foreign Bodies/*diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/psychology/*surgery; Mental Disorders/epidemiology; Self-Injurious Behavior/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the current view suggests that endovascular stent-graft treatment is  useful for AEF, whether a subsequent thoracic operation is necessary remains  controversial. The purpose of this report is to describe our experience using  endovascular stent-graft treatment without combined thoracic operations for the  treatment of AEF in two specific cases. CASE SUMMARY: We presented two cases of  patients complaining of retrosternal discomfort treated in our department for an  aortoesophageal fistula caused by the accidental ingestion of a fishbone. The two  patients were effectively managed with combined means of endoscopic, medical  (broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, fasting, gastrointestinal decompression,  etc.) and endovascular stent-graft treatment. The main difference in treatment  was that the first patient presented with hematemesis after endoscopic removal of  the fishbone. Subsequently, the patient underwent endovascular stent-graft  treatment. The second case was managed with endoscopic removal of the fishbone  with simultaneous endovascular stent-graft treatment, without any signs of  hematemesis or melena. Both patients had successful postoperative management and  were discharged home. Long-term follow-up is ongoing. CONCLUSION: The treatment  decision-making process should depend on the patients' specific situations. Our  practice indicates that endovascular stent-graft treatment without combined  thoracic operations could be a valuable alternative in selected patients.","2022-03-06","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","2206-2215","","7","10","","World J Clin Cases","","","","","","","","eng","©The Author(s) 2022.

Foreign body ingestions in prisoners are always intentional and  inmates can be manipulative, which makes medical decision even more difficult.  Our objective is to propose a decisional algorithm for management of foreign body  ingestion in prisoners. We reviewed the records of 198 admissions for foreign  body ingestion for a 10-year period. Type and number of ingested foreign bodies,  radiographic findings, outcome as well as the management method including  conservative, endoscopic removal, or surgical treatment were analyzed. Most cases  were managed conservatively (87.6%). Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal  tract was performed in 37 cases with a success rate of 46 per cent. In 9.3 per  cent of cases, the final treatment was endoscopic. Only five patients required  surgical treatment, being emergent just in one case. We advocate conservative  treatment for asymptomatic patients with foreign body ingestion. Endoscopic  removal is proposed for pointed objects or objects bigger than 2.5 cm located in  the stomach. Objects longer than 6 to 8 cm located in the stomach should be  removed by endoscopy or laparoscopy. Patients with objects in the small bowel or  colon should be treated conservatively unless there are complications or they  fail to progress.","2014-02","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","131-137","","2","80","","Am Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24480212","","","","Humans; Adult; Retrospective Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Cohort Studies; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult; Follow-Up Studies; Radiography; Incidence; *Prisoners; *Deglutition; Risk Assessment; Endoscopy/methods/statistics & numerical data; Foreign Bodies/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/*surgery/therapy; Gastrointestinal Tract/*surgery; Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data; Laparotomy/methods/statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We report a case of  meat bolus with cartilaginous component impacted in the cervical esophagus, with  a brief literature review. CASE REPORT A 64-year-old man came to our attention  for retention in the cervical esophagus of a piece of meat accidentally swallowed  during lunch. After a few attempts of endoscopic removal carried out previously  in other hospitals, the patient has been treated by us with a cervical  esophagotomy and removal of the foreign body, without any complications. We  checked the database of PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library from January  2007 to January 2017 in order to verify the presence of randomized controlled  trials, clinical trials, retrospective studies, and case series regarding the use  of the cervical esophagotomy for the extraction of foreign bodies impacted in the  esophagus. CONCLUSIONS The crucial point is to differentiate the cases that must  be immediately treated from those requiring simple observation. Endoscopic  treatment is definitely the first therapeutic option, but in case of failure of  this approach, in our opinion, cervical esophagotomy could be a safe, easy,  viable, durable approach for the extraction of foreign bodies impacted in the  cervical esophagus.

Much has been written about psychiatric patients  engaging in self-mutilation such as cutting and burning, but little is recorded  about deliberate aspiration of objects in these patients, who clinically can be  separated into 4 groups: (1) malingering, (2) psychosis, (3) pica, and (4)  personality disorders. The immediate psychological gain for these patients is  unclear, as the act is insidious with no evidence of intentional harm or  immediate danger. Thus, they are considered as being parasuicidal events designed  to diminish other psychological processes. Aspirated objects that are not  immediately dislodged by coughing, choking, or gagging require surgical  intervention. Most of these patients usually come to the attention of a  psychiatrist, but such intervention does not prevent recurrences.

The majority of the cases of accidental foreign body ingestion are observed in  children. In adults, foreign body ingestion can be accidental, related to  specific pathological changes of the digestive tract, or deliberate, as observed  in patients with psychiatric diseases or in those released from the prison. CASE  PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with  symptoms including choking, drooling from the mouth, holding his neck, and  aphonia. He had a history of psychiatric illness with suicidal ingestion of a  foreign body. After stabilization, he was sent for chest radiograph, which  revealed a significant radiopaque shadow the shape of a spanner, occupying the  whole length of the esophagus. Emergency rigid esophagoscopy was performed to  save the patient's life. DISCUSSION: The patient swallowed the largest hard  foreign body to harm himself or his family, to get the attention of his family,  or as a suicide attempt. Such patients require urgent intervention by rigid  esophagoscopy to reduce the risk of complications and to save the patients'  lives. Further follow-up is essential due to the possibility of repeated foreign  body ingestion. CONCLUSION: While taking care of psychiatric patients, close  observation by family members is mandatory to prevent them from harming  themselves and to prevent suicide attempts by swallowing sharp, hard, large, and  dangerous foreign bodies such as the size 17 wrench spanner observed in the  present case.","2020-06","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","82-84","","","54","","Ann Med Surg (Lond)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020 The Author(s).","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32405412  PMCID: PMC7210472","","","","Adult; Esophagus; Foreign body; FB, Foreign body; Psychiatric patient; Self-injurious behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: The occurrence of EFB ingestion was  significantly higher (p<0.05) on holidays (2.75/day) than on weekdays (0.91/day)  and weekends (1.46/day). Patients were much older on holidays, with a mean age of  58.18 ± 17.34 years, than patients on weekdays (54.71 ± 16.71 years) and weekends  (55.05 ± 17.36 years). CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that EFB ingestion is  most likely to occur on weekends and holidays, and elderly patients should be  advised to chewing slowly and eating non-nuclear jujube, especially during  holidays, to minimize their risk.","2021","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","2499-2506","","","14","","Risk Manag Healthc Policy","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 Wu et al.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 34163269  PMCID: PMC8214566","","","","esophageal foreign body; holiday; weekday; weekend","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The medical record was queried for all patients under 21 years  old evaluated at our institution for button battery ingestion from 2008 to 2021.  A severe outcome was defined as having at least one of the following:  deep/circumferential mucosal erosion, perforation, mediastinitis, vascular or  airway injury/fistula, or development of esophageal stricture. From a selection  of clinically relevant factors, logistic regression determined predictors of a  severe outcome, which were incorporated into a risk model. RESULTS: 143 patients  evaluated for button battery ingestion were analyzed. 24 (17%) had a severe  outcome. The independent predictors of a severe outcome in multivariate analysis  were location of battery in the esophagus on imaging (96%), battery size  >/ = 2 cm (95%), and presence of any symptoms on presentation (96%), with  P < 0.001 in all cases. Predicted probability of a severe outcome ranged from 88%  when all three risk factors were observed, to 0.3% when none were present.  CONCLUSION: We report the presentation, management, and complication profiles of  a large cohort of BB ingestions treated at a single institution. A risk score to  predict severe outcomes may be used by providers initially evaluating patients  with button battery ingestion in order to allocate resources and expedite  transfer to a center with pediatric endoscopic and surgical capabilities.

Sodium-glucose  cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor has become one of the most common causes of  EDKA. We present one of the lowest presenting blood glucose levels for the EDKA  in the setting of SGLT2 inhibitor use. A 34-year-old female with a two-year  history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) presented after accidental ingestion  of a metal clip and lack of oral intake for 28 hours. She reported a recent  intentional weight loss of 60 lbs. She takes metformin 1000 mg twice daily and  empagliflozin 25 mg daily. An urgent endoscopy was planned in the intensive care  unit given the proximal location of the foreign body. The basic metabolic profile  after the procedure demonstrated a glucose level of 75 mg/dL, bicarbonate level  of 11 mmol/L, and AG of 17 mmol/L. The venous pH was 7.27 with a partial pressure  of carbon dioxide of 30 mmHg. The urinalysis showed a glucose level greater than  500 μmol/L with a ketone level of 80 μmol/L. The blood and urine toxicology  screening results were unremarkable. The patient was treated for EDKA with the  administration of intravenous (IV) dextrose 5% in water with subsequent  initiation of IV insulin. The assessment of her insulin reserve revealed a low  C-peptide of 0.36 ng/mL, a high glutamic acid decarboxylase level greater than  250 IU/mL, and high zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) antibodies of 42 U/mL, consistent  with an undiagnosed transition to latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).  The blood glucose levels for previously reported cases remain between 90 and 250  mg/dL. In this case, the combination of a low carbohydrate diet and prolonged  starvation may have led to the impressively low glucose. Additionally, the SGLT2  inhibitor use in patients with LADA serves as one of the known risk factors for  EDKA. EDKA poses a diagnostic challenge, especially in the ICU setting where  there exists a myriad of causes for high AG metabolic acidosis. Additionally,  many of the ICU patients are in a ketotic state brought on by prolonged  starvation. Therefore, prompt diagnosis and treatment for EDKA require careful  history taking and complete investigation for other causes of high AG metabolic  acidosis.","2022-04","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","e24016","","4","14","","Cureus","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022, Kang et al.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35573514  PMCID: PMC9091341","","","","diabetic ketoacidosis (dka); euglycemic; latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (lada); sglt-2 inhibitor; swallowed foreign body","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Massive  ingestions can result in severe toxicity and even death. We describe a case of  diphenhydramine overdose leading to cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation  (CPR), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) cannulation for refractory  ventricular fibrillation, a process we refer to as extracorporeal cardiopulmonary  resuscitation (ECPR). CASE REPORT: Responding to a call for altered mental  status, emergency medical service (EMS) personnel found an unconscious and  seizing 17-year-old male. He had reportedly developed generalized tonic-clonic  seizures and dysrhythmias after ingesting approximately 800 25-mg diphenhydramine  tablets. He was transferred to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) after  stabilization at a local emergency center. After approximately 7 hours of  clinical stability and normalization of cardiac rhythm, electrolytes, and  acidosis, he developed renewed seizure activity and accelerated ventricular  rhythm leading to hemodynamic collapse and cardiac arrest. He was cannulated for  veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VAECMO) with CPR in progress.  A pharmacobezoar located in his stomach was presumed to be the cause of his  biphasic clinical deterioration. After 5 days, the patient was successfully  weaned from ECMO support. Ten days later, his convalescence continued in the  step-down unit and was discharged with good functional outcome. DISCUSSION:  Significant ingestion of anticholinergic substances is often fatal. This case  describes a favorable outcome after ECPR and aggressive supportive management  following a large intentional overdose of diphenhydramine.","2018-09","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","253-256","","3","14","","J Med Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 29956117  PMCID: PMC6097973","","","","Humans; Male; Adolescent; Treatment Outcome; Electrocardiography; Critical Care; Diphenhydramine/*poisoning; Pharmacobezoar; Bezoars; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/*methods; Diphenhydramine; ECPR; Epilepsy, Tonic-Clonic/chemically induced; Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/*methods; Heart Arrest/chemically induced/therapy; Histamine H1 Antagonists/*poisoning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present the case of a patient with an extensive history of FBIs  and suicide attempts and a multitude of psychiatric diagnoses including  borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress  disorder from significant abuse in foster care, obsessive-compulsive disorder,  and pica. During the single hospitalization described in this report, she had  multiple incidents of self-harm, aggression, and 9 FBIs. A multidisciplinary team  involving psychiatry, emergency medicine, gastroenterology, surgery, internal  medicine, nursing, social work, behavioral health technicians, case management,  chaplain, the legal department, police officers, and hospital maintenance was  necessary for care coordination. Interventions included 8 endoscopies and an  abdominal surgery to retrieve swallowed foreign bodies, pain management,  psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions for agitation, and  environmental precautions to minimize the risk of ingestion. Ultimately, to  prevent further trauma and limit additional opportunities for FBI, a  collaborative decision was made with the patient to discharge her to her home  with outpatient psychologist and psychiatrist support. This case describes the  complexities of hospital management of a patient with intentional recurrent FBI,  highlighting the importance of a critical assessment of risk versus benefit for  prolonging hospitalization. Development of practical management protocols and  risk assessments for continued hospitalization is necessary for patients with  recurrent intentional FBIs.","2023-03-01","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","167-173","","2","29","","J Psychiatr Pract","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Our objective was to evaluate the  guidelines' impact on in-hospital resource utilization and short-term clinical  outcomes in hemodynamically stable patients after endoscopic battery removal.  METHODS: A single-center retrospective review of all EBBI admissions from 2010 to  2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on adoption of national  guidelines: pre-guideline (2010-2015) and post-guideline (2016-2020). RESULTS:  Sixty-five patients were studied (pre-guideline n = 23; post-guideline n = 42).  Compared with pre-guideline, post-guideline use of magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) increased (2/23 [8.7%]; 30/42 [71.4%]; p < 0.001). Post-guideline increases  resulted for median days (IQR) receiving antibiotics (0 [0, 4]; 6 [3, 8];  p = 0.01), total pediatric intensive care unit admission (0 [0, 1]; 3 [0, 6];  p < 0.001), and total hospital length of stay (5 [2, 11]; 11.5 [4, 17];  p = 0.02). Two patients in the post-guideline group had delayed presentations  despite normal imaging: one with TEF and one with aorto-esophageal fistula. All  survived to discharge. CONCLUSION: In EBBI cases managed using the consensus  based NASPHAGN guidelines, we report increased resource utilization without  improved patient outcomes. Further research should evaluate post-guideline costs  and resource utilization.","2022-03","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","473-478","","3","38","","Pediatr Surg Int","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

Current literature lacks good  data documenting long-term outcomes in children. This makes it difficult to  counsel some patients about realistic treatment expectations. The objective of  this study is to evaluate our institutional experience and define the natural  history and treatment outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective review of clinical data  obtained from children who underwent dilation for PS was performed. RESULTS: Over  the past 30 years, 114 children and adolescents received 486 dilations. The most  common indications for stricture dilation were PS (42%) and esophageal atresia  (38%). Other lesser indications included congenital, foreign body, corrosive,  cancer, radiation, allergic, and infectious. This review focuses on the 48  children with PS. Of the children with PS, a congenital anomaly was identified in  23 children; and 12 had neurologic impairment. Average age at presentation was  10.2 years (range, 0.5-18.3 years). Most patients had had symptoms for many  months before diagnosis. Peptic stricture was most common in the lower esophagus  (n = 39). However, middle (n = 8) and upper (n = 1) strictures were occasionally  identified. Noncompliance with medical therapy was a challenge in 12% (n = 5) of  children. Children with a PS received a median of 3 dilations, but a subset of 5  patients with severe strictures underwent up to 48 dilations (range, 1-48).  Repeated dilations were required for a median of 20 months (range, 1-242 months).  Among patients receiving esophageal dilation for PS, 94% required an antireflux  procedure (19% required a second antireflux surgery). A subgroup of patients (n =  10) was identified who required extended dilations, multiple surgeries, and  esophageal resection. This subgroup had a significantly longer period of  symptomatic disease and increased risk of esophageal resection compared with  those patients requiring fewer dilations. Surgical resection of the esophageal  stricture was ultimately required in 3 children with PS after failure of more  conservative measures. CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents presenting with  reflux esophageal stricture (PS) frequently require antireflux surgery, redo  antireflux surgery, and multiple dilations for recurrent symptoms. We hope that  these data will be of use to the clinician attempting to counsel patients and  parents about treatment expectations in this challenging patient population.","2010-12","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","2356-2360","","12","45","","J Pediatr Surg","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The  purpose of the present study was to evaluate a conservative protocolled approach  to body packers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively registered all patients  suspected of body packing who were brought to a department of surgical  gastroenterology. The study comprised a two-year study period from 1 March 2011  to 28 February 2013. RESULTS: A total of 57 patients suspected of body packing  were detained and admitted to a hospital. In 29 (53%) of the patients, body  packing was confirmed by CT. All 29 body packers were successfully treated  conservatively without surgical or endoscopical intervention. The median number  of packages ingested was 55 (range 2-120). The body packers were all foreigners  and originated from either Eastern Europe or West Africa. In one patient, body  packages were retained for 17 days. None of the body packers underwent emergency  operation or had signs of rupture. CONCLUSION: Body packers can be treated  conservatively unless there is clinical suspicion of acute obstruction,  perforation or intoxication. Package retention per se is not an indication for  emergency operation. FUNDING: not relevant.

METHODS:  The medical records of 249 patients who ingested FBs were reviewed. In addition,  they were studied by telephone questionnaires to follow up spontaneously passed  FB. The factors associated with SP such as age, the type, size, and initial  location of the FBs were analyzed. RESULTS: Foreign bodies were spontaneously  passed in 145 patients (58.2%), endoscopic removal was performed in 100 patients  (40.2%), and operative removal was performed in 4 patients (1.6%). Most SP FBs  were passed within 5 days. The SP rates (SPRs) according to the initial location  were the following: 12.2% for the esophagus (P<0.0001), 71.4% for the stomach,  85.7% for the small bowel, and 96.4% for the colon. There was no significant  difference in the SPR according to age. When coins and disk batteries that  required early endoscopic removal were excluded, the SPR was 63.4% for FBs less  than 10 mm, 80.4% for FBs 10 to 20 mm, 72.8% for FBs 20 to 30 mm, and 50.0% for  FBs more than 30 mm (P=0.091). The initial location of the FB (odds ratio, 33.7;  95% confidence interval, 14.4-79.0) and the size of the FB (odds ratio, 3.5; 95%  confidence interval, 1.0-11.6) were independent predictors of SP by multivariate  analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Most FBs in the gastrointestinal tract are spontaneously  passed without complication, and the initial location of FBs was found to be the  main determining factor for SPR.

Pediatric and psychiatric patients are the two most common  populations suffering from accidental or in some cases intentional ingestion of  foreign bodies. Commonly, majority of cases require no specific treatment and the  swallowed objects pass through the digestive tract spontaneously without causing  any significant complications. Less than 1% of the cases complicates with  gastrointestinal tract perforation, which are often caused by sharp objects,  which warrants surgical intervention. The average time from foreign body  ingestion to development of perforation was noted at 10.4 days in previous  reports. These cases often present in rapidly progressing peritonitis and are  subsequently managed by emergent laparotomy. In this case report, we describe an  accidental chopstick ingestion of a patient who initially was misdiagnosed and  remained asymptomatic for nine months, then presented with acute abdomen. CASE  PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old man accidentally ingested a wooden chopstick and  sought consult at a clinic. Negative abdominal plain film misled the physician to  believe ingested chopstick was digested into fragments and passed out unnoticed.  The patient presented acute abdomen caused by duodenal perforation nine months  later and was subsequently treated with emergency laparotomy with primary  duodenorrhaphy. CONCLUSIONS: Negative plain films are not sufficient to conclude  a conservative treatment in foreign body ingestion. Computed tomography scan or  endoscopic examinations should be done to rule out retained foreign body within  gastrointestinal tract.","2019-09-10","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","132","","1","19","","BMC Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 31500608  PMCID: PMC6734462","","","","Humans; Adult; Male; Emergency Service, Hospital; Radiography; Foreign body; Abdomen, Acute/*etiology/surgery; Digestive System Surgical Procedures/methods; Duodenum; Endoscopy/methods; Foreign Bodies/*complications; Intestinal Perforation/*surgery; Laparotomy/*methods; Perforation; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most cases pass through  the esophagus slowly; however, in some cases, the tumor may be located in  narrower areas of the digestive tract that require endoscopic or surgical  intervention. This study describes a rare case of successful removal of more than  450 pieces of metal objects from the stomach of a 36-year-old man via ingestion  of foreign bodies at Imam Khomeini Hospital in Ahvaz. CASE PRESENTATION: A  36-year-old male patient (Aryan race) presented with complaints of chronic  abdominal pain, frequent vomiting, and intolerance to liquids and food. The  patient's companions mentioned a history of gradual ingestion of small metal  objects 3 months prior. The patient was conscious and had stable vital signs. In  the patient's X-ray and endoscopy, multiple metal objects inside the patient's  stomach were observed, causing gastric outlet obstruction. The patient underwent  gastrostomy surgery, and 452 screws, nuts, keys, stones, and other metal parts  weighing 2900 g were removed from the stomach. Five days after the operation, the  patient was transferred to the psychiatric service in good general condition and  was diagnosed with psychosis, and her condition returned to normal at follow-up.  CONCLUSION: Successful removal of this foreign body is rare. In chronic abdominal  pain, especially in the context of psychiatric disorders, attention should be  given to the ingestion of foreign bodies. In swallowing large amounts of sharp  and metallic foreign objects, surgical intervention is necessary, especially in  cases of obstruction, and saves the patient's life.","2024-08-16","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","381","","1","18","","J Med Case Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024.

Magnets pose a unique set of risks when ingested due to their attractive forces  and subsequent risk of adherence, pressure necrosis, and perforation  complications. Radiographs only provide a limited snapshot in the setting of  multiple magnet ingestion when the risk of complication is highest. We  hypothesize that abdominal ultrasound (US) has the potential to supplement  radiographs in assessing ingested magnets by determining the presence of bowel  loop entrapment and of any extraluminal fluid. METHODS: We recreated various  scenarios of magnet configurations using animal cadaveric bowel models. X-ray and  US images were obtained in various bowel-magnet orientations. RESULTS: We  identified several key US features to suggest bowel wall tethering. These include  direct visualization of bowel wall entrapment between magnets (what we term the  ""dangerous V sign""), anti-dependent positions of the magnets, and inability to  separate loops of bowel with compression. CONCLUSION: These findings could  potentially provide valuable information when directing the urgency of  intervention in foreign body ingestion. Ultrasound may supplement and improve the  current guidelines in management of magnet ingestion.","2023-10","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","589-596","","5","30","","Emerg Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Small objects pass  spontaneously; however, larger ones may get stuck in the oesophagus, stomach or  at narrow areas of the bowel. 'Body packers' is a term used to describe persons  who swallow or insert drug-filled packets into a body cavity. They are also  called 'swallowers', 'internal carriers', 'couriers' or 'mules'. We report a  37-year-old previous drug abuser who presented with dysphagia. Upper GI endoscopy  showed an oblong foreign body covered in plastic in the lower oesophagus. This  could not be extracted and hence was pushed into the stomach. Three weeks later,  he presented with bowel obstruction that was shown on abdominal radiograph and  confirmed by CT indicating multiple dilated small bowel loops with a transition  point in the terminal ileum where the ingested package was identified. The  package was then removed through a longitudinal enterotomy. Ingested foreign  bodies causing dysphagia should ideally be extracted endoscopically. If not  possible, then a watch-and-wait policy may be justified. While most ingested  objects pass spontaneously, unusual and larger ones may require surgical  extraction. The contents, nature and reason for ingesting this strange object  remain a mystery.

METHODS: Children <18years old who  ingested a battery between 1/2011 and 9/2016 at two tertiary care children's  hospitals were reviewed. Demographics, imaging, management and outcomes were  analyzed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square and Wilcoxon Rank-sum tests.  RESULTS: There were 180 battery ingestions. The median age was 3.9 (range 0.7-18)  years, with 78 (43%) males. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain (17%)  and nausea/vomiting (14%). Diagnosis was confirmed with plain radiographs in 170  (94%) patients. Locations on imaging were: stomach (37%), small bowel (24%),  esophagus (18%), colon (11%), and non-specific location past the gastroesophageal  junction (9%). Treatment was dictated by five different subspecialties including  surgery (35%), gastroenterology (25%), emergency medicine (19%), primary  care/emergency with a consulting service (13%), and otolaryngology (8%). All  esophageal batteries (n=33) had an intervention. Interventions included  fluoroscopic balloon extraction (6 attempted, 33% retrieval rate), rigid  esophagoscopy (26 attempted, 96% retrieval rate), and EGD (6 attempted, 83%  retrieval rate). For batteries distal to the gastroesophageal junction 16 (11%)  patients had an intervention. Interventions included EGD (13 patients, 69%  retrieval), colonoscopy (1 patient, successful retrieval), and abdominal surgery  in two patients.

METHODS: The records of  children admitted to a single institution who had a history of foreign body  ingestion over 33 years were reviewed. Symptoms, radiological findings, and  endoscopic findings were assessed. RESULTS: Foreign bodies were detected in 552  (43%) of the 1,265 children admitted. The age of the children ranged from 6  months to 16 years (mean, 5.2 years). The preschool toddlers (mean age, 3.8  years) were most prone to ingest inanimate objects. The most common objects were  coins (49%) and nonmetallic sharp objects (NMSO; 31%). Although x-rays could  detect all the metallic objects and 86% of glass objects, the sensitivity of fish  bone detection is only 26%. Absence of symptoms was common (50% in metallic group  and 29% in NMSO group). Forty-one percent of coins and 95% of NMSO were lodged at  sites suitable for removal by direct laryngoscopy alone with success rates of 86%  and 77%, respectively. There were 3 disease-related complications and 1  mortality. Two of these children were mentally retarded and presented late.  CONCLUSIONS: Efforts for prevention of ingestion of inanimate foreign body should  focus on the preschool toddler group. Particular attention should be paid to  mentally retarded children with vague gastrointestinal symptoms. Absence of  symptoms does not preclude presence of foreign body in children. Children with  history of NMSO ingestion should undergo direct laryngoscopy despite negative  radiological finding, both as a screening procedure or treatment.","1999-10","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","1472-1476","","10","34","","J Pediatr Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10549750","","","","Humans; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Child; Stomach; Esophagus; Child, Preschool; Infant; *Digestive System; Intestines; *Foreign Bodies/diagnosis/therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Coins are by far the most common ingested foreign bodies. When ingested coins become lodged in  the esophagus, they may cause serious complications if they are not removed in a  timely manner. Endoscopic removal is the preferred treatment in many pediatric  centers as its safety and effectiveness are well established. OBJECTIVES: We  performed this study to evaluate safety and effectiveness of an alternative  method of managing esophageal coins, using bougienage technique. METHODS:  Previously healthy children presenting to the local emergency room with  uncomplicated, witnessed coin ingestion of less than 24 hours duration were  prospectively recruited with an intent-to-treat analysis. A single oral passage  of a Hurst bougie dilator was performed by a gastroenterologist to dislodge the  esophageal coin into the stomach. If bougienage was successful (x-ray showing  coin in the stomach), patients were discharged and instructions were given for  monitoring stools until passage of the coin through anus was confirmed. If  bougienage was unsuccessful, the child developed symptoms at any time or if a  coin remained intragastric for 4 weeks, endoscopic removal was planned. Children  whose parents declined to participate in the bougienage treatment received the  standard endoscopic removal and their hospital records were used as controls.  RESULTS: A total of 10 children were enrolled in this study, with a mean age of  3.2 years (11 mo to 10 y), 6 boys and 4 girls. All received little or no  sedation. Nine children (90%) were successfully treated using bougienage, all of  whom spontaneously passed the ingested coins, with a mean duration of 2.6 days (1  to 7 d) without subsequent intervention. A single case failed bougienage and  underwent endoscopic removal. Three children declined bougienage treatment and  underwent endoscopic removal. There were no reported minor or major adverse  events with any of our cases. The mean health care cost for the hospital visit  for bougienage treatment was $1210, compared with $3100 for the endoscopic  removal (P<0.001). Furthermore, the mean time spent in the hospital from  diagnosis to discharge was 2 hours for bougienage-treated patients compared with  8 hours for endoscopic treatment (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bougienage of impacted  esophageal coins is an effective, safe, and more economic treatment modality for  selected pediatric patients with uncomplicated coin ingestion. This simple  technique may provide a valuable tool to emergency room physicians or primary  care doctors especially when endoscopy is not readily available.","2007-06","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","454-456","","5","41","","J Clin Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17450025","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Treatment Outcome; Child; Child, Preschool; Infant; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Dilatation/economics/instrumentation/methods; Esophagoscopy/economics/*methods; Foreign Bodies/economics/*therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aortic injury caused by a perforating esophageal foreign  body is rare but lethal. The optimal management still remains controversial. The  purpose of this report is to describe our experience in the management of the  aortic injury caused by esophageal foreign body ingestion. METHODS: Between  January 2015 and December 2015, we retrospectively enrolled cases of esophageal  perforation involving the aorta by foreign body. The general parameters,  esophageal foreign body, types of aortic injury, treatment, and outcome were  analyzed. Additionally, we reviewed the literature of the management of  esophageal perforation involving the aorta caused by foreign bodies. The study  was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, College of  Medicine, Zhejiang University, and the need for informed consent was waived  (Quick review 2019, No. 609). RESULTS: Three cases of esophageal perforation  involving the aorta by foreign body was selected in the study. Two male and 1  female patients (range, 51-58 years old) with the aorta involvement caused by a  perforating foreign body in the esophagus in 3 forms were identified, including 1  patient with mycotic aortic pseudoaneurysm, 1 patient with aortoesophageal  fistula and 1 patient with the aortic intramural hematoma. One patient died of  the rupture of the pseudoaneurysm during the preparation of the surgery. The  other 2 patients were cured with a multidisciplinary approach, which is an urgent  thoracic endovascular aortic repair followed by mediastinal debridement/drainage  or endoscopic retrieval. Two of 3 patients were survived until now. CONCLUSION:  The management of the aortic injury caused by esophageal foreign body injury is  challenging. Early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management is crucial.","2020-06-26","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","e20849","","26","99","","Medicine (Baltimore)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 32590781  PMCID: PMC7328905","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Foreign Bodies/*complications/diagnostic imaging; Aneurysm, False/complications; Angiography/methods; Aorta/diagnostic imaging/*injuries/pathology; Eating/physiology; Esophageal Fistula/complications; Esophageal Perforation/complications; Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical guidelines recommend performing plain x-rays as the primary  modality of diagnosis. Although point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) has increasingly  been integrated into the daily practice of emergency medicine, it has been poorly  investigated in the diagnostic approach for FBI.This review aims to highlight the  current state of PoCUS use for pediatric FBI.The following research question was  considered in this narrative review: Is PoCUS useful for FBI management? METHODS:  A literature search was conducted to identify articles reporting PoCUS use for  the management of FBI. All articles were assessed for quality by 2 reviewers.  MAIN RESULTS: The 14 selected articles reported 52 FBI cases in which PoCUS  successfully identified and located the ingested FB. Point-of-care ultrasound was  used either as the primary imaging technique or after positive or negative x-ray  findings. In 5 cases (9.6%), PoCUS was the only modality used for the diagnosis.  Of these cases, 3 (60%) underwent a successful procedure to remove the FB and 2  (40%) received conservative treatment without complications. CONCLUSIONS: This  review suggests that PoCUS might be a reliable modality for the initial  management of FBI. PoCUS can locate, identify, and evaluate the size of the FB in  a wide range of materials and gastrointestinal locations. Point-of-care  ultrasound could eventually become the go-to modality in the case of radiolucent  FB, thus avoiding the use of radiation. Further studies are nevertheless required  to validate PoCUS use for FBI management.","2023-09-01","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","728-733","","9","39","","Pediatr Emerg Care","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Esophageal  obstruction in cattle is generally caused by greedy nature of chewing and  swallowing of food and foreign structures, including stones, potatoes,  trichobezoar, carrots, foodstuffs (i.e., hay), and rice chaff. Esophageal  obstruction in cattle can also be caused by artificial procedures, and early  detection and treatment are important to avoid severe esophageal injury and its  associated risks. Herein, an 11-month-old Japanese black heifer presented with  swelling and induration of the neck and snowball crepitation in the subcutaneous  area of the left shoulder. Radiography and endoscopy revealed a spring-like  foreign body in the esophagus and a cervical esophageal obstruction. Esophageal  surgery confirmed that the foreign body was a ruminal mechanical stimulating  brush (RB). The case died on day 8 after the initial examination. Pathological  necropsy revealed that the RB had entered the esophageal diverticulum and caused  esophageal obstruction.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Three  hundred patients presenting with a history of either aspirating or swallowing a  foreign body were analyzed in a tertiary care center. Data were collected by  retrospective chart review and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 300  patients studied, 90% (270 cases) did have a retained foreign body, with 233  (86.2%) cases found in the pharyngoesophagus and 37 (13.7%) cases in the  tracheobronchial tree. With foreign bodies in the tracheobronchial passages, the  most common sign and symptom were rhonchi (50%) and dyspnea (67%), respectively;  in pharyngoesophagus, the most common symptom and sign were dysphagia (64%) and  odynophagia (45%), respectively.

Many modalities of IMF have been described; recently IMF screws  have been introduced into clinical practice, however, hardware failure can occur.  We performed a retrospective study evaluating hardware-associated complications  for self-drilling/tapping IMF screws. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective  study on 49 patients requiring IMF was performed. The diagnosis, duration of IMF,  screw site, use of elastic or wire fixation, and associated complications were  recorded. IMF screws were used to adjunct open reduction techniques, for  definitive closed reduction, or fracture prevention following dentoalveolar  surgery. Follow-up examinations were performed until fracture healing was  complete (6 to 8 weeks). RESULTS: A single adverse event occurred in 19 patients  (39%) while 4 patients (8%) had more than 1 complication. The most common event  was screw loosening; 29% of patients had at least 1 screw dislodged in the  treatment period. Of the total number of screws placed (229), 15 (6.5%) became  loose, and were equally distributed among the mandible and maxilla. The remaining  complications noted were root fracture, 4% (2 of 49); loosened wires, 6% (3 of  49); screw shear, 2% (1 of 49); malocclusion, 2% (1 of 49); and ingested  hardware, 2% (1 of 49). CONCLUSIONS: Overall the IMF self-drilling/tapping screws  have been shown to be a useful modality to establish maxillomandibular fixation.  It is a safe, and time-sparing technique; however, it is not without limitations  or potential consequences which the surgeon must be aware of in order to provide  safe and effective treatment.","2007-09","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","1746-1750","","9","65","","J Oral Maxillofac Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17719392","","","","Humans; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Stomach; Chi-Square Distribution; *Bone Screws; Equipment Failure; Foreign Bodies/etiology; Fracture Fixation, Internal/adverse effects/*instrumentation; Jaw Fixation Techniques/adverse effects/*instrumentation; Maxillofacial Injuries/*surgery; Skull Fractures/*surgery; Tooth Root/injuries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There was no evidence of acute  gastrointestinal obstruction on abdominal computed tomography; we therefore  decided to perform surgical observation. The intraoral plaster lesions were  successfully removed using forceps, and the plaster bezoar was successfully  eliminated without surgical treatment. The present case shows that not all  patients with plaster poisoning require surgery; the patient's conditions, such  as gastrointestinal obstruction, should indicate the course of treatment.","2022-06","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","146-149","","2","9","","Clin Exp Emerg Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Korea (South) PMID: 35843616  PMCID: PMC9288885","","","","Treatment; Case report; Eating; Calcium sulfate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to evaluate a management protocol where endoscopic examination  was only selectively used after routine direct laryngoscopy to minimize patient  discomfort and the need for general anesthesia in children. METHOD: A management  protocol for foreign body ingestion based on symptoms was introduced in 1998 and  records of children admitted to a university-affiliated hospital between January  1999 and October 2005 with suspected foreign body ingestion were evaluated.  Symptoms, radiologic and endoscopic findings, and outcome were reviewed. RESULTS:  A total of 282 patients were admitted. The mean age of patients was 5.75 years  (range, 9 months to 17 years). There were 167 boys and 115 girls. Based on our  protocol, 84 (29.8%) patients required an upper endoscopy. Fish bones were most  commonly involved (68.8%). Foreign bodies, which were either removed or  dislodged, were found during upper endoscopy in only 25 (8.8%) patients overall.  All patients had an uneventful outcome. No complications or mortalities were  encountered. There were no readmissions for those who did not undergo endoscopic  examination. CONCLUSION: It is safe to selectively perform upper endoscopy  depending on symptoms when managing children with foreign body ingestion.","2006-12","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","2016-2018","","12","41","","J Pediatr Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17161195","","","","Humans; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Infant; Foreign Bodies/*surgery; *Endoscopy, Digestive System; Gastrointestinal Tract/*surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pediatric gastroenterologists and surgeons were  increasingly tasked with removing these problematic objects. The purpose of this  study was to assess the utility of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) in  the management of ingested magnets. Patients and Methods: This is a  single-center, retrospective assessment of surgical interventions for ingested  magnets. International Classification of Disease, 10th revision codes were used  to identify 349 patients ≤21 years of age evaluated for foreign body ingestion  over a 4.5-year period. A medical record review helped isolate 29 (8.3%) magnet  ingestions, 9 requiring surgical intervention. RedCap was used for analysis.  Results: Of 9 surgical patients, 7 underwent SILS intervention by 1 surgeon.  Another surgeon performed an open operation, whereas a third performed a  multiport operation. Of the 7 SILS cases, 3 were completed without conversion to  open. In one of these cases, bowel resection with primary anastomosis was  performed. For SILS cases, average operating room time was 109 minutes (38-170  minutes), time to enteral feeds was 23 hours (0.28-79.2 hours), and hospital  length of stay (LOS) was 3.8 days (1.96-6.68 days). Thirty-day readmission for  SILS was 14.3%. No other complications were observed. Conclusions: SILS has been  safely utilized for magnet retrieval. It offers an ability to identify the  affected intestinal segment and an opportunity to intervene extracorporeally  through an uncapped port. In addition, knowing where matted bowel is located can  direct a limited incision during conversion to laparotomy. This may confer  benefits of decreased pain, shortened time to enteral feeds, and decreased  hospital LOS.","2024-06","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","530-534","","6","34","","J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38016150","","","","Humans; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Adolescent; Child; Young Adult; Child, Preschool; Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data; foreign body ingestion; neodymium; *Laparoscopy/methods; *Magnets; *Foreign Bodies/surgery; buckeyball; Neodymium; Operative Time; rare earth magnet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intentional overdose  of potassium supplements is an uncommon occurrence. OBJECTIVE: This case  illustrates a novel approach to treatment of pharmacobezoar with  esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and demonstrates its effectiveness in the  setting of extended-release potassium chloride overdose. CASE REPORT: A  44-year-old female presented to the ED with intentional ingestion of an unknown  amount of extended-release potassium chloride (K-Dur®) tablets and alprazolam  (Xanax®). The patient's serum potassium was initially 7.3 mmol/L and she was  treated with standard treatments, including albuterol, calcium gluconate,  insulin, dextrose, and sodium bicarbonate. Radiographic investigation showed a  pharmacobezoar in the gastric fundus. Treatment was then augmented with whole  bowel irrigation (WBI) using polyethylene glycol solution via nasogastric tube.  Patient did not tolerate the nasogastric tube, became combative with increasing  alteration in her level of consciousness, and WBI therapy was stopped. After  discussion with the gastroenterologist, the patient was treated with EGD to  remove the pharmacobezoar. The EGD was successful in the removal of the  pharmacobezoar and the patient's potassium normalized without complications.  CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that in cases of suspected or confirmed potassium drug  bezoar in the stomach, physicians consider EGD for removal. This allows for  normalization of potassium level while preventing adverse sequelae.","2014-03","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","351-354","","3","46","","J Emerg Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We report  the case of a 20-year-old man who was admitted to the emergency room for acute  moderate hematemesis. The patient had no significant medical history. An urgent,  nonsedated upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy was performed, which revealed  bleeding but no foreign objects.

Ingested foreign bodies typically pass through  the digestive tract without incident. However, long, sharp, and thin objects can  remain in the gastrointestinal tract for 7-10 days and may become lodged in areas  of physiological narrowing.

It can be ingested intentionally or  accidentally. The small bowel bezoar prevalence ranges between 0.4 % and 4 %, and  the prevalence is less than 0.5 % for gastric bezoars. There are different types  of bezoars, but the mention of a plastic bezoar rarely appears in the literature.  To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a plastic bezoar in the  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old woman was admitted for  acute kidney injury, and while working her up, it was discovered that she had a  possible foreign body on computerized tomography scan. As a result, she underwent  exploratory laparotomy with the findings of plastic foreign objects identified  90 cm from the ileocecal valve and other objects identified in the stomach.  CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The impaction of these materials often occurs in narrow  areas such as the lower esophagus, duodenum, ileocecal valve or even the anus. In  this unique case, two points of impaction were noted: the first was in the small  bowel and the second point in the stomach. The approach to such cases could be  Endoscopic versus surgical or even chemical dissolution as a choice of treatment  is dependent on multiple factors. CONCLUSION: The approach to these cases is  multidisciplinary and depends on the availability of services and resources at  the treating hospital. Reporting such cases helps in managing challenging  situations. Additionally, a psychiatric assessment is a crucial step.","2024-04","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","109506","","","117","","Int J Surg Case Rep","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

Nonoperative  approaches such as dietary therapy, enzymatic dissolution, and endoscopic removal  have been regarded as the mainstays of therapy. The purpose of this paper is to  determine the efficacy of electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) as an alternative  form of treatment of gastric bezoars. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 1988 and  May 1996, 11 patients with large gastric bezoars, defined as those greater than 5  cm in diameter, received endoscopic-guided fragmentation using electrohydraulic  lithotripsy. Nine of our patients had a history of ingestion of ""Pho Pu Zi"",  (Cordia dichotoma Frost. f.), one of orange pitch, and one of ingestion of  persimmon. RESULTS: The 11 patients in the study underwent EHL for the treatment  of their gastric bezoars, with a 100% success rate, which was defined as the lack  of residual bezoar seen on post-procedure barium study or endoscopy done 2 days  after the procedure. Patients were followed-up clinically for 30-68 months, with  seven of the 11 patients undergoing a barium study with no residual bezoar noted.  No procedure-related complications were seen, except for pharyngeal pain which  was most probably secondary to the placement of the silicon overtube.  CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopically guided electrohydraulic lithotripsy is a safe, highly  effective, alternative nonsurgical technique for the treatment of gastric  bezoars.","1999-06","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","386-388","","5","31","","Endoscopy","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 10433049","","","","Humans; Adult; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome; Follow-Up Studies; Radiography; Safety; *Stomach; Gastroscopy; Bezoars/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*therapy; Lithotripsy/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A  prospective study was performed on 36 patients (26 F, 10 M, mean age 70 years)  with a history of foreign body impaction. All had negative findings at indirect  laryngoscopy. Radiologic assessment included unenhanced helical CT and a barium  contrast study. Patients with positive findings were taken to esophagoscopy. All  patients had a posterior clinical surveillance. RESULTS: Twenty patients had both  normal CT and barium study and satisfactory clinical outcome. In 12 patients a  foreign body was noted in the cervical esophagus by CT, barium study, and  endoscopy. In one patient a fish bone was detected by CT (and not by barium)  confirmed with esophagoscopy. Another patient had a fish bone esophageal  perforation which was observed only by CT and confirmed at surgery. Two patients  with normal barium and endoscopy presented a false-positive CT result.  CONCLUSION: Barium swallow is currently the first radiologic study, but may  involve a risk of aspiration and can impede a subsequent esophagoscopy.  Esophagoscopy is an invasive technique with a certain risk of serious  complications that can be avoided with a satisfactory radiologic assessment. CT  is easy, fast, has 100% sensitivity and is therefore the first choice technique  for diagnosing suspected upper esophageal foreign bodies not expected to be  visible on plain radiographs.","2004-07","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","369-374","","4","45","","Acta Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15323387","","","","Humans; Aged; Prospective Studies; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome; Follow-Up Studies; Esophagoscopy; Sensitivity and Specificity; Contrast Media; Foreign Bodies/*diagnostic imaging; Esophagus/*diagnostic imaging; Laryngoscopy; *Tomography, Spiral Computed; Barium Sulfate; Esophageal Perforation/diagnostic imaging; False Positive Reactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We  reviewed the clinical history and radiographic surveys of 134 patients presenting  with suspected or witnessed coin ingestion to the emergency department of a  tertiary care pediatric hospital between January 2012 and June 2016. Patient  demographics, presenting symptoms, anatomic coverage of survey, type, number and  location of radiopaque foreign bodies, intervention, and follow-up were recorded.  RESULTS: Coins were identified on radiographic surveys in 109 of 134 patients; 25  of 134 patients had no coin. Of those with coins, none of 109 had coin(s) in the  airway, 42 of 109 had coin(s) in the esophagus, and 67 of 109 had coin(s) distal  to the esophagus. Of those with esophageal coins, 35 of 42 reported symptoms, 7  of 42 were asymptomatic, 40 of 42 underwent endoscopic coin removal, and 2 of 42  had no intervention. Of 92 of 134 surveyed patients with no coin or coin distal  to the esophagus, 30 of 92 reported symptoms, 62 of 92 were asymptomatic, 90 of  92 had no further intervention, and 2 of 92 eventually underwent endoscopic coin  removal for specific indications (abdominal pain, delayed passage). When there  was no coin found in the esophagus, the negative predictive value for  intervention was 97.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Following a clear history of coin ingestion,  a frontal chest radiograph including the entire length of the esophagus provides  sufficient information to direct patient management.","2021-09-01","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","e524-e527","","9","37","","Pediatr Emerg Care","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional  analysis of national databases; literature review. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The  Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance  System (NEISS) was used to derive a national weighted estimate of emergency  department visits for wire bristle injury from 2002 to 2014. Date, location of  injury, demographics, and outcomes were analyzed. A literature search and a  consumer-reported injury database (SaferProducts.gov) were interrogated to  provide ancillary sources of data. RESULTS: A total of 43 cases were found within  the NEISS database, which extrapolated to an estimated 1698 (95% confidence  interval, 1468-1927) emergency department visits nationwide. In the NEISS  database, the mean age was 30 years, and the sex distribution of the patients was  similar (21 males vs 22 females). The most common location of injury was the  oropharynx in both the NEISS database (23 of 43, 53.4%) and the literature review  (11 of 36, 30.5%). However, the oral cavity was the most frequent site in the  consumer-reported SaferProducts.gov database (9 of 24, 37.5%). The majority of  patients in the NEISS were treated in the emergency department (31 of 43, 69.7%).  Raw case counts were highest in June, July, and August, with the highest number  of events in the month of July. CONCLUSION: Injury from wire-bristle grill brush  is uncommon but prevalent during certain seasons. Otolaryngologists play an  important in the diagnosis and treatment of these injuries. Awareness among  consumers and product manufacturers is necessary to promote safety.","2016-04","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","645-649","","4","154","","Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg","","","","","","","","eng","© American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2016.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26932965","","","","Adult; Consumer Product Safety; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emergency Service, Hospital/statistics & numerical data; Female; Foreign Bodies/*epidemiology/*surgery; grill brush; Household Products/*adverse effects; Humans; ingestion; Male; Mouth/*injuries; NEISS; Pharynx/*injuries; Population Surveillance; swallow; United States/epidemiology; wire bristle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When they are radiolucent, these objects become a diagnostic challenge, but they can  be investigated sonographically. However, successful object identification  depends on the skill of the sonographer. Considering that these cases appear  randomly during hospital routines, it is not always possible to train all  students to identify them correctly. Therefore, the aim of this study was to  produce homemade simulations of radiolucent foreign bodies for veterinary student  demonstrations that could be identified sonographically and to evaluate the  acceptability, applicability, and usefulness of these simulations according to a  visual analog scale questionnaire and subjective questions. For this purpose,  object models (a pacifier nipple, a toy ball, a sock, nylon thread, and a mango  seed) were designed, produced, and immersed in gelatin. To simulate wood  splinters in the integumentary and musculoskeletal system, a piece of meat  punctured with a toothpick and ice cream stick splinters were used. The type of  phantom had a determinant effect on the visualization (chi-square = 36.528, P <  0.0001) and recognition (chi-square = 18.756, P = 0.0021) capability of the  students. All of the students answered that their experience with the models  could help in real situations. The student responses to the questionnaire  indicated that the project was well accepted, and the participants believed that  this experience could be applicable to and useful in veterinary routines.","2017-03-01","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","94-98","","1","41","","Adv Physiol Educ","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28143829","","","","*Fluorescent Dyes; *Schools, Veterinary; *Students, Health Occupations; active methodologies; Animals; education; Female; Foreign Bodies/*diagnostic imaging; homemade models; Humans; Male; Swine; Ultrasonography, Interventional/methods/*statistics & numerical data; ultrasound; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we report a case of intentionally swallowed coins in the  oesophagus of an adult; the coins could not be detected on chest radiography but  were detected using computed tomography (CT). CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old  woman with a history of depression presented to the emergency department after an  intentional medication overdose and ingestion of two Japanese 1-yen coins. She  complained of persistent retrosternal discomfort. In order to confirm whether the  coins were in the oesophagus or trachea, an anteroposterior chest radiograph was  obtained; however, no coins were detected. Owing to her persistent symptoms, a  chest CT was performed. On the initial CT scan, two 1-yen coins were observed in  the oesophagus: one in the middle oesophagus and the other in the lower  oesophagus. After the scanning, the patient drank water with permission, but  vomited. No coins were found in her vomit, and the symptoms of retrosternal  discomfort had completely disappeared. A subsequent CT scan revealed that the two  1-yen coins were in the patient's stomach. CONCLUSIONS: Japanese 1-yen coins are  made of 100% aluminium, which is less radiopaque than the metals that make up  coins (nickel, bronze, and lead), and so, they were not visible via chest  radiography in our case. Detecting very small or thin radiolucent foreign bodies  is not possible using a chest radiograph or contrast oesophagram, but is possible  via CT. CT is both increasingly convenient and non-invasive, unlike endoscopy or  bronchoscopy, and so, the use of CT scans should be considered in cases of  possible radiolucent foreign body ingestion.","2017-09-05","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","27","","1","10","","Int J Emerg Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 28871560  PMCID: PMC5583139","","","","CT scan; Oesophageal coins; Radiolucent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to present some  practical suggestions for ingested safety pins using an accompanying algorithm,  presented for the first time in the literature to the best of our knowledge.  METHODS: Twenty children with ingested safety pins during a 4-year period were  retrospectively included in the study. RESULTS: Median age of patients was 9.5  months (interquartile range, 6.3-14 months), and 70% were girls. On endoscopic  examination, safety pins were observed in the stomach (25%), duodenal bulb (20%),  upper esophagus (15%), middle esophagus (10%), and second part of the duodenum  (10%) but were not observed in 20% of the cases. Safety pins were removed using  endoscopy in 15 cases (75%). In four cases (20%), no safety pin was observed on  endoscopic examination. In one case (5%) involving a 6-month-old infant, the  safety pin could not be removed although it was observed using endoscopy. No  surgical intervention was needed for any patient. No complications such as  perforation or deaths developed, except for erosions, due to the foreign body  removal procedure. CONCLUSION: Safety pins are easily removed endoscopically. The  best option is to remove the safety pin using endoscopy while it is still in the  esophagus and stomach. For this reason, endoscopic procedures should be performed  as soon as possible in children who have ingested safety pins.","2019-09","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","441-446","","5","22","","Pediatr Gastroenterol Hepatol Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Korea (South) PMID: 31555568  PMCID: PMC6751102","","","","Algorithms; Endoscopic, Foreign body; Safety pin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study was to identify  factors related to outcomes of FB ingestion, particularly BBs in the stomach. We  evaluated whether the current recommendations are appropriate and aimed to  suggest indications for endoscopic removal of BB in the stomach in young  children. METHODS: We investigated patient age, shape, size, location of FBs,  spontaneous passage time and resulting complications among 76 children. We  observed types, size, location of BB and outcomes, and analyzed their  associations with complications. RESULTS: Coins and BB were the two most common  FBs. Their shapes and sizes were not associated with the spontaneous passage  time. Size, spontaneous passage time, and age were also not associated with any  specific complications. For BB ingestion, all 5 cases with lithium batteries  (≥1.5 cm, 3 V) presented moderate to major complications in the esophagus and  stomach without any symptoms, even when the batteries were in the stomach and  beyond the duodenum, while no complications were noted in 7 cases with alkaline  batteries (<1.5 cm, 1.5 V) (p=0.001). All endoscopies were conducted within 24  hours after ingestion. CONCLUSION: The type and voltage of the battery should be  considered when determining whether endoscopy is required to remove a BB in the  stomach. For lithium battery ingestion in young children, urgent endoscopic  removal might be important in order to prevent complications, even if the child  is asymptomatic and the battery is smaller than 2 cm.","2016-03","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","20-28","","1","19","","Pediatr Gastroenterol Hepatol Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Korea (South) PMID: 27066446  PMCID: PMC4821979","","","","Button battery; Endoscopy; Foreign bodies; Ingestion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accurate diagnosis often requires examination under anaesthesia as pain prevents careful assessment. This  report intends to highlight a rare cause of a superficial perianal fistula caused  by an ingested foreign body. A 36-year-old Afro-Caribbean gentleman underwent  examination under anaesthesia of rectum. He had a 2-week history of perianal pain  and discharge. Intra-operatively, a piece of bone from a pork spare rib was found  embedded within the superficial subcutaneous fistula. There was an associated  abscess cavity adjacent to the fistula, which was curetted. The fistula was laid  open and the bone was removed. The cavity was successfully left to heal by  secondary intention. Ingested foreign body is a very unusual cause of perianal  sepsis and subsequent fistula formation. Incision and drainage of the abscess  along with removal of foreign body is the key to immediate pain relief and cure.","2011-10-01","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","4","","10","2011","","J Surg Case Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© JSCR.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 24950549  PMCID: PMC3649308","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics and management  of foreign-body ingestions, with predominantly intentional ingestion, in a lower  socioeconomic status population. DESIGN: A retrospective case series. SETTING: An  urban county hospital. PATIENTS: Patients >/=17 years old, with foreign-body  ingestions between 2000 and 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Characteristics of  ingestion cases, endoscopic extraction, need for surgery, and complications.  RESULTS: Among 262 cases, 92% were intentional, 85% involved psychiatric  patients, and 84% occurred in patients with prior ingestions. The time from  ingestion to presentation was >48 hours in 168 cases (64%). The overall success  rate for endoscopic extraction was 90% (165/183 cases). Surgery was performed in  30 cases (11%) and was more common for objects beyond the pylorus versus objects  above the pylorus (16/43 [37%] vs 10/151 [7%], respectively) and in cases with a  greater delay from ingestion to presentation (25/168 [15%] if >48 hours vs 4/77  [5%] if </=48 hours) and from presentation to intervention (15/40 [38%] if >48  hours vs 14/165 [8%] if </=48 hours). Perforation occurred in 16 cases (6%), with  6 perforations noted after endoscopy. LIMITATION: A retrospective review of  medical records. CONCLUSIONS: Foreign-body ingestions in an urban county hospital  occurred primarily in psychiatric patients who had repeated episodes of  intentional ingestions. Endoscopic extraction was unsuccessful in 10% of cases.  Long delays from ingestion to presentation and intervention may account for  relatively high rates of surgery and perforation. Strategies to prevent  ingestions and delays in endoscopic management are needed in this population.","2009-03","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","426-433","","3 Pt 1","69","","Gastrointest Endosc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19019363","","","","*Foreign Bodies/therapy; *Self-Injurious Behavior; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal; Humans; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study is to determine the minimal, optimal  volume of local anesthetic required for successful ultrasound-guided SGB and to  reduce its adverse effects. METHODS:  Thirty-five patients with postherpetic  neuralgia and complex regional pain syndrome of the upper extremity and the  facial area were selected. For ultrasound-guided SGB by subfacial method, each  patient was injected with 0.5% mepivacaine mixed with contrast media in 2 mL,  3 mL, and 4 mL doses at 2-week intervals. After the procedure, the spread of  contrast media in the spine was checked by fluoroscopy. Ptosis and conjunctival  flushing were rated and recorded. Adverse effects, such as hoarseness, foreign  body sensation, swallowing difficulty, and upper arm weakness, were also  recorded. RESULTS:  Out of the 35 initial patients, the results for 33 patients  who received all three SGBs were included in this study. The contrast media  spread to 4.80 ± 0.82, 4.94 ± 0.86, and 5.09 ± 0.97 total spinal segments in the  2 mL, 3 mL, and 4 mL groups, respectively. The cephalad spread of contrast media  was 2.16 ± 0.74, 2.23 ± 0.85, and 2.30 ± 0.78 spinal segments for the 2 mL, 3 mL,  and 4 mL groups, respectively, and the caudad spread of contrast media was  2.64 ± 0.51, 2.70 ± 0.61, and 2.89 ± 0.64 segments in the 2 mL, 3 mL, and 4 mL  groups, respectively. There were no significant statistical differences in any  segments for the three groups (P > 0.05). Review of the fluoroscopic images  showed spread of the contrast media below the C7-T1 junction in all three groups.  Ptosis developed in all three groups after the procedure. CONCLUSION:  In  conclusion, when performing an ultrasound-guided SGB, 2 mL dosage was sufficient  for a successful block as the previous, conventional volume. Therefore, when  performing an ultrasound-guided SGB, we recommend the 2 mL dosage of local  anesthetics for a successful block.","2012-11","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","1381-1388","","11","13","","Pain Med","","","","","","","","eng","Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 23013477","","","","Adult; Aged; Anesthetics, Local/*administration & dosage; Autonomic Nerve Block/*methods; Chronic Pain/*drug therapy; Cross-Over Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Mepivacaine/*administration & dosage; Middle Aged; Stellate Ganglion/diagnostic imaging/drug effects; Ultrasonography, Interventional/*methods; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An  echocardiogram was performed revealing a left atrial mass concerning for myxoma.  During the surgical removal of the mass, a hypodermic needle was found attached  to the roof of the left atrium surrounded by thrombotic and fibrotic tissue,  which was confirmed by pathology. DISCUSSION: Cardiac FBs are caused generally by  penetrating wounds from direct trauma. Fewer cases have been reported regarding  cardiac FB caused by ingestion from migration of the object to the heart. Signs  and symptoms for cardiac FB may mimic those of cardiac masses.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate findings at serial MRI after endoscopic removal of a button battery from the esophagus in a series of  pediatric patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Serial MRI examinations after removal  of a button battery from the esophagus were reviewed retrospectively for the  presence of mediastinal edema; imaging characteristics of the aorta and arteries;  imaging characteristics of the trachea; and imaging characteristics of the  esophageal wall at the level of injury. RESULTS. A total of 48 MRI examinations  were performed on 19 patients, 89% (17/19) in the first 48 hours after battery  removal. Serial MRI was performed for 84% (16/19) of patients. Initial MRI showed  extensive mediastinal edema in all 17 patients who underwent MRI in the first 48  hours. Edema directly abutted major arteries in all 17 patients and abutted the  airway in all 10 patients with proximal esophageal injury. Arterial vascular  changes were seen in 30% (3/10) of patients with proximal esophageal injury and  57% (4/7) of patients with mid or distalesophageal injury. Airway changes were  seen in 80% (8/10) of patients with proximal esophageal injury. Serial MRI showed  improvement of airway changes in all patients and improvement in vessel wall  changes in all but one (25%, 1/4) of the patients who had mid or distal  esophageal injury. Four patients (21% [4/19]) had contained esophageal leak on  esophagrams. No patients in our series developed a tracheoesophageal or  vascular-enteric fistula. CONCLUSION.

METHODS: A retrospective  review was done of the medical records of 112 infants and children who presented  with UGI bleeding. They underwent UGI endoscopy in the Taipei Veterans General  Hospital, Taiwan between July 1996 and December 2000. Patients with hematemesis  caused by swallowing caustic agents or foreign bodies were excluded. RESULTS:  There were 112 patients involved in this study. Clinical manifestations included  hematemesis (77 cases, 68.8%), tarry stool (37 cases, 33%) and hematochezia (9  cases, 8%). Fifty-three patients (47.3%) had underlying diseases, including  neuromuscular deficits (17), hepatobiliary disease (17), renal insufficiency (8),  Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) (3), and cow milk allergy (3). Another 34 patients  had a preceding acute febrile illness history. The endoscopic appearances  included esophageal varices (10.7%), esophagitis or esophageal ulcers (30.4%),  superficial gastric mucosal lesions (SGML) (44.6%), gastric ulcers (9.8%),  duodenal ulcers (DU) (15.2%), and hemorrhagic erosive duodenitis (2.7%). Eleven  cases (9.8%) showed negative findings. There were 13 (11.6%) patients receiving  endoscopic hemostatic therapy. The rate of positive results in rapid urease tests  in the patients without underlying diseases was 54.8%, which was significantly  higher than that of the patients with underlying diseases (17.1%), while  Helicobacter pylori was closely related to primary DU. CONCLUSIONS: In children  with UGI bleeding, UGI endoscopy provides an accurate diagnostic tool and also  provides therapeutic intervention when needed. SGML was the most common  endoscopic finding.

The diagnosis of intestinal perforation  following blister ingestion is often delayed because of an unreliable history and  nonspecific clinical presentation. The purpose of this case report is to raise  awareness about a rare but difficult diagnosis and its importance in avoiding  potentially fatal events. CASE REPORT Herein, we describe successful cases of  surgical and endoscopic removal after blister ingestion. The first case was that  of a polymorbid 75-year-old man who presented with acute onset of abdominal pain  in the right upper quadrant and epigastric regions. No indication of the cause  was observed on initial computed tomography (CT). The patient developed an acute  abdomen, and emergency laparotomy was performed, during which 2 small  perforations were observed in the terminal ileum, and an empty tablet blister was  retrieved. The second patient was a 55-year-old man who presented with a  considerable lack of awareness. On the initial CT, a subdural hematoma,  aspiration, and an unidentified foreign body in the stomach were observed.  Gastroscopy was performed after emergency craniotomy. In addition to the initial  foreign body, a second object, which had gone unnoticed on the initial CT, was  found and removed from the esophagus. CONCLUSIONS With an increased risk of  perforation and difficult clinical and radiological diagnoses, prophylactic  measures and special awareness of high-risk patients are particularly important.","2024-04-16","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","e943514","","","25","","Am J Case Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38622861  PMCID: PMC11034392","","","","*Foreign Bodies/complications/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *Intestinal Perforation/etiology/surgery/diagnosis; Aged; Blister; Eating; Humans; Ileum; Male; Middle Aged","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The esophageal structure and  function of 8 patients treated for AFBI requiring endoscopic removal of  alimentary foreign bodies in 6 of them (up to 4 times in 1 case) were  investigated by barium meal, esophagoscopy-biopsy, pH-metering, pull-through  stationary manometry, and 24-hour ambulatory manometry. The results were compared  with those in a group of age-matched regular refluxers (n = 14) without AFBI.  RESULTS: Six boys and 2 girls aged 108 +/- 59 months had impaction. Six children  had symptoms of GER like vomiting during infancy, heartburn, or respiratory tract  disease. Barium swallow ruled out stenosis in all patients and showed small  hiatal hernias in 3. All had endoscopic and histologic esophagitis (moderate to  severe in 6), and one had Schatzki ring. All but one (who had 8.45 mm Hg) had  normal lower esophageal sphincter pressure (16.2 +/- 4.7 mm Hg, mean +/- SD), and  all showed normal sphincteric relaxation. Esophageal body motility was not  significantly different from that in regular refluxers except in 6 children in  whom energetic distal peristalsis after reflux episodes could be seen  particularly during the night. Three of them had amazingly powerful distal waves  during the day and even stronger, simultaneous, wide and bizarre-shaped waves  during sleep. Symptoms improved in all cases after antireflux medication. Four  patients were cured after antireflux surgery. CONCLUSIONS: AFBI is a dramatic but  practically unheard of symptom of GER in children. It should be differentiated  from dysphagia and reveals motor dysfunction, sometimes severe, of the esophageal  body in the absence of sphincteric obstruction. Antireflux medication or surgery  were uniformly successful in our patients.","2001-09","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","1397-1400","","9","36","","J Pediatr Surg","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2001 by W.B.

The lighter was  successfully removed via flexible endoscopy using a polypectomy snare. Swallowed  long and rigid foreign bodies trapped in the stomach over a long period of time  always represent a special clinical and endoscopic challenge. In cases where  endoscopic removal fails, a laparoscopic surgical approach may be an alternative.","2012-05","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","238-242","","2","6","","Case Rep Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 22679411  PMCID: PMC3369402","","","","Flexible endoscopy; Lighter; Polypectomy snare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to avoid complications such as perforation,  endoscopic removal of potentially penetrating foreign bodies should be attempted  quickly. The use of various endoscopic techniques has been reported for this  purpose. However, extraction of foreign bodies from the mid gastrointestinal  tract has rarely been reported. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a patient who  had swallowed a safety needle which could safely be removed from the jejunum by  means of double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE). The combination of a thin p-type  enteroscope with a thick t-type overtube was used in order to improve the  manoeuvrability of the endoscope. The needle was pulled into the overtube which  served as a protective shield during the retrieval of the endoscope. CONCLUSION:  Our case report describes the potential of removing foreign bodies from the deep  small bowel by pulling them into the overtube of a double-balloon enteroscope. If  the suspicion of foreign body impaction in the small bowel is made, it may be  advisable to primarily choose a balloon enteroscopy system. Through this, quick  and deep insertion can be combined with a safe removal of the foreign body.","2015-08","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","794-797","","8","53","","Z Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","ger","© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 26284328","","","","Aged; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal/*instrumentation/*methods; Female; Foreign-Body Migration/pathology/*surgery; Humans; Jejunum/*injuries/pathology/*surgery; Needlestick Injuries/pathology/*surgery; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this report, we present  a rare case of razor blades lodged in the appendix as a result of intentional  ingestion. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 25 year old male prisoner presented to our  hospital with persistent right iliac fossa pain after razor blade ingestion.  After 5 days of conservative management, there was no sign of transition on  serial X-Rays. Laparoscopy with intraoperative image intensification confirmed  the presence of the razor blades in the appendix and appendicectomy was  subsequently performed without complications. DISCUSSION: Most ingested objected  with diameter less than 2.5 cm and length less than 6 cm can pass through the  gastrointestinal tract spontaneously in less than one week. The entry of foreign  objects into the appendix is thought to be due to relative low motility of the  caecum, the dependent position of the appendix and the size of the appendiceal  orifice. Radiographic localisation to the appendiceal lumen was complicated by  metallic artefact, but was consistent with failure to transit. Appendicectomy was  felt to be the safest mode of retrieval. CONCLUSION: Ingested foreign body lodged  in the appendix is a rare event. Once the exact location is confirmed, a simple  laparoscopic appendicectomy can be performed to facilitate the removal.","2018","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","29-32","","","45","","Int J Surg Case Rep","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

Only a few cases of peritonitis or intra-abdominal abscesses secondary  to perforation of the digestive tract by an ingested foreign body have been  reported. The most common sites of impaction and perforation include the  appendix, cecum and the terminal ileum. The rectum is an unusual site of foreign  body impaction. This report intends to highlight that ingested foreign body  impacted in the rectum is an extremely rare cause of perianal abscess and  subsequent fistula in infants. CASE SUMMARY: Two cases of perianal abscess and  fistula due to ingested jujube pit impacted in the rectum are reported. Both  cases are infants with free previous medical history suffered from recurrent  perianal infection. The caregivers of the two patients denied ingestion of a  foreign body or any history of trauma. Physical examination combined with  ultrasound or computed tomography scan established the diagnosis. Both of the  patients underwent operation under general anesthesia. In case 1, a jujube pit  with sharp ends was discovered embedded within a subcutaneous fistula. The jujube  pit was then removed intact along with fistula resection. The wound was  successfully laid open to allow healing by secondary intention. In case 2, a  jujube pit was found with its sharp end puncturing the rectum, surrounded by pus  and necrotic tissue. Subsequent incision and adequate drainage were performed.  The whole jujube pit was then removed from the abscess cavity at the same time.  Both patients received colonoscopy to rule out inflammatory bowel disease or  other potential damages by the ingested jujube pit. The postoperative period was  uneventful. At 1.5 year follow-up, no recurrent abscess or fistula were found in  either patient. CONCLUSION: An impacted foreign body must not be overlooked as an  unusual cause of perianal abscess and fistula, especially in young children.","2020-10-26","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","4930-4937","","20","8","","World J Clin Cases","","","","","","","","eng","©The Author(s) 2020.

The purpose of this retrospective case series was to describe the  ultrasonographic features, histopathological findings, and clinical presentation  in a group of cats with benign small intestinal stricture. Inclusion criteria  were cats presenting during the period 2010-2017, and that had ultrasonography  and small intestinal stricture confirmed at surgery. For each cat, clinical data  and ultrasonographic findings were retrieved from the medical record, and  histopathology, where available, was reviewed. Eight cats met the inclusion  criteria. The location of strictures was duodenum (1/8), mid- to distal jejunum  (4/8), and ileum (3/8). Ultrasonographic findings included gastric distension  (8/8) and generalized (3/8) or segmental (5/8) intestinal dilation consistent  with mechanical obstruction. Ingesta did not propagate beyond the strictured  segment. Wall thickening was mild to moderate (3-6 mm). Normal wall layering was  disrupted in all cats. Strictures were predominantly hypoechoic (7/8) and  associated with hyperechoic peri-intestinal mesentery (6/8). Annular strictures  (5/8) were less than 15 mm in length whereas long-segment strictures (3/8) were  greater than 15 mm in length. Histopathology showed transmural disease with  fibrosis and inflammation (8/8), often (6/8) extending into the bordering  mesentery. The mucosa was the most severely affected layer and epithelial injury  accompanied the mucosal fibrosis/inflammation. Clinical presentation reflected  delayed diagnosis of chronic bowel obstruction with debilitation (8/8), marked  weight loss (8/8), and prerenal azotemia (5/8). Benign fibrostenotic stricture  should be considered a differential diagnosis in debilitated young cats  presenting with chronic bowel disease and ultrasonographic features of intestinal  obstruction.","2019-07","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","423-431","","4","60","","Vet Radiol Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 American College of Veterinary Radiology.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 31050093","","","","Animals; Cat Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology; Cats; Constriction, Pathologic/diagnostic imaging/pathology/veterinary; feline; Female; Fibrosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*veterinary; foreign body; Intestinal Obstruction/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*veterinary; Intestine, Small/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology; ischemia; Male; Retrospective Studies; stenosis; Ultrasonography/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose is to identify  the number of inadvertent ingestions of beverage-can stay-tabs by children  recognized at our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical information  system of a children's hospital was searched with key terms to identify cases in  which a witnessed or self-reported inadvertent ingestion of a beverage-can  stay-tab resulted in a radiograph to rule out presence of a foreign body.  Demographics, identification of stay-tab on radiographs, associated  abnormalities, and patient management were reviewed. RESULTS: Nineteen cases of  stay-tab ingestion were identified over 16 years.

Following evaluation by the surgical team,  the foreign body was removed by laparotomy and the patient was discharged back to  the prison without complication. In many cases, ingestions of this type involve a  command hallucination ordering the patient to swallow the foreign body.  Interestingly, the patient in the present case reported auditory hallucinations  commanding him not to swallow the can lid.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis over 12 years was conducted of 45 cases of  buried fish bones in the surrounding tissue of upper gastrointestinal tract with  complications. Meanwhile, a control group, including 39 cases of prolonged buried  fish bones in the surrounding tissue of upper gastrointestinal tract without  complications, was set. Patient clinical data were collected and analyzed to  predict the risk factors for complications. RESULTS: The results of Chi-square  test and univariate analysis both showed a significant difference in length of  fish bone (> 2 cm), a history of concurrent medical illness (diabetes mellitus  and renal hypofunction), symptoms (medium or heavy pain and dysphagia), and  duration of significant symptoms (> 7 days) between the complication group and  non-complication group.

Part A","","1092-6429","10.1089/lap.2006.0060","","PURPOSE: In our country, safety pin ingestion by infants is commonplace. When swallowed, open safety pins are mostly found within the esophagus or stomach, and  they cannot be easily removed by rigid esophagogastroscopy. Our aim was to  evaluate the removal of safety pins using flexible endoscopy in infants.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the cases of 7 infants who had ingested open  safety pins between 2001 and 2004. In all the patients, the primary diagnostic  tool was a direct x-ray of the neck, chest, and abdomen. In all cases, the safety  pins were removed by flexible esophagogastroduo-denoscopy. Clinical records for  the cases were reviewed. RESULTS: Four of the open safety pins were lodged in the  esophagus, two in the stomach, and one in the duodenum. One infant had a safety  pin lodged in the esophagus with the pin's open end pointed caudally; the pin was  held with the endoscopic forceps by its tail end and removed. Three safety pins  in the esophagus had their open ends pointing cephalad; these were held by their  tail ends using the endoscopic forceps and pushed into the stomach. Then they  were rotated in the stomach and removed tail end first. The safety pins located  in the stomach or duodenum were also removed similarly. All safety pins were  successfully removed, and there were no operative complications. CONCLUSION: Open  surgery or other invasive removal methods are not necessary in infants with open  safety pin ingestions. In our opinion, the best way to extract an open safety pin  from the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum is by using a flexible endoscopic  device.","2007-04","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","242-245","","2","17","","J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17484658","","","","*Duodenum; *Endoscopy, Digestive System; *Esophagus; *Stomach; Child, Preschool; Female; Foreign Bodies/*therapy; Humans; Infant; Male","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The association between symptoms (pain upon  swallowing or turning the head and the sensation of a foreign body in the throat)  and SCO was investigated. Pearson chi-square tests were used for the comparison  of proportions, (α=.05). RESULTS: A total of 44.9% of those with TMD and 46.2% of  the control population exhibited SCO (P=.858). TMD was associated with pain upon  swallowing (P<.05) and upon turning the head P<.01), but there were no  associations between the symptoms possibly related to SCO and the presence of  ossification (pain upon swallowing P=.658; sensation of a foreign body in the  throat P=.980; pain upon turning the head P=.405). CONCLUSIONS: The results  suggest that there are no associations between TMD and SCO. Some symptoms  classically associated with SCO also occur in TMD patients.","2013-02","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","79-82","","2","109","","J Prosthet Dent","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 The Editorial Council of the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry.

METHODS: Retrospective review of patients treated for esophageal  coin ingestion at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin over a 1-year period using  bougienage or endoscopic retrieval was conducted. (inclusion criterion) RESULTS:  Twenty-seven patients were evaluated over the 1-year study period. Two patients  spontaneously passed the coins before arrival and needed no further treatment.  Twelve patients met criteria for bougienage, and this treatment was successful in  10 of the 12 patients. Mean length of hospital stay was 2.15 hours, and the mean  cost was $546. Thirteen patients were treated successfully with endoscopy. The  mean length of hospital stay was 22.7 hours, and the mean cost was $5,230. There  were no complications in any of the 25 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Bougienage is  equally safe, more efficient, and much less expensive than endoscopy for  treatment of esophageal coins in properly selected patients. Nearly half of the  patients were excluded from bougienage because of delayed presentation alone.  Education of parents and physicians regarding symptoms of coin ingestion would  allow primary treatment with bougienage in the majority of cases.","1999-03","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","412-414","","3","34","","J Pediatr Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10211643","","","","*Esophagus; Child, Preschool; Cost Savings; Costs and Cost Analysis; Dilatation/economics; Endoscopy/*economics; Foreign Bodies/*economics/*therapy; Humans; Length of Stay/economics; Retrospective Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A retrospective study  was performed to identify and evaluate time to treatment and outcome for all  esophageal button battery ingestions presenting to a major children's hospital  emergency room from February 1, 2010 through February 1, 2012. During the first  year, standard emergency room triage (ST) was used. During the second year, the  triage protocol was changed and Trauma I triage (TT) was used. RESULTS: 24  children had suspected button battery ingestions with 11 having esophageal  impaction. One esophageal impaction was due to 2 stacked coins.

However, the experience in the pediatric population is  limited. Minimally invasive esophagectomy represents a new alternative technique  to the conventional open approach. We wish to report our small case series of  minimally invasive esophagectomy and gastric pull-up in pediatric patients. The  aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of the  procedure. METHODS: Three patients (2 girls and 1 boy) with average age 46 months  (34-57 months) and average weight 12.6 kg (11-15 kg) underwent the procedure. The  indications for esophagectomy were esophageal stricture from caustic ingestion (2  patients) and failed repair of esophageal atresia (1 patient). RESULTS: Average  operative time was 7 h (0519-0752 hours). There were no intraoperative  complications with the average blood loss of 50 cc (5-125 cc). No anastomotic  leaks were noted on the initial esophagrams that were obtained on postoperative  day five or six. One patient developed a cervical wound infection on  postoperative day seven due to a retained piece of Penrose, which required a neck  exploration, removal of foreign body and repair of a small leak. One patient  developed an anastomotic stricture at the 7-month follow-up. She was successfully  treated with two balloon dilatations. One patient developed a delayed  esophagogastric anastomotic leak at 3 months. The leak spontaneously closed after  surgical drainage. At average of 22-month follow-up (15-36 months), all patients  were eating regular food with excellent weight gain. CONCLUSION: Minimally  invasive esophagectomy and gastric pull-up is technically challenging but  feasible and safe with acceptable outcomes.

Under the suspicion of bowel  ischemia, the patient underwent a contrast-enhanced CT scan. A thickened ileal  loop with an endoluminal bone-density foreign body was detected. The following  contrast-enhanced acquisitions additionally showed air bubbles adjacent to the  loop, as the sign of an intestinal perforation that occurred between the basal  and the contrast-enhanced acquisitions.

Body stuffers are street cocaine dealers, who either store wrapped  packets of drugs in their rectum or hastily swallow them, prompted by fear of  police's arrest. These packets can be life threatening in case of leakage. We  evaluate the diagnostic value of unenhanced multidetector CT (MDCT) for detection  of cocaine-filled packets (CFP) ingested by body stuffers in a phantom model.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our phantom simulated normal bowel contents in which a  varying number of true and false CFP were randomly mixed. Both only differ in  radiological density. During 18 different reading sessions, four radiologists  independently evaluated the presence and number of true and false CFP.  Interobserver agreement, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative  predictive value were calculated. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement for detection  of any packets, for visualization of true, and false CFP was good (kappa=0.63,  0.74 and 0.58, respectively). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative  predictive value for detection of any packets was 95.6%, 100%, 100% and 62.5%,  respectively; for visualization of the true CFP 86.5%, 100%, 100% and 77.6%,  respectively; and for the false packets 98.1%, 65%, 88.6% and 87.5%,  respectively. CONCLUSION: Unenhanced MDCT without bowel preparation is a fast,  reliable and easily reproducible imaging modality for the immediate detection of  ingested CFP, thus facilitating medicolegal management of body stuffers.","2008-07","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","133-138","","1","67","","Eur J Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Ireland PMID: 17768023","","","","Cocaine/*analysis; Foreign Bodies/*diagnostic imaging; Humans; Intestines/*diagnostic imaging; Phantoms, Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Substance Abuse Detection/*methods; Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Usually the cases involve lumps of meat, bones, shards  of glass, bottle tops, batteries or dentures. We would like to report about an  unusual foreign body found in the oesophagus. PATIENT: A 45-year-old patient  presented himself in our interdisciplinary casualty department where he claimed  to have swallowed a butter-knife that morning as a bet. The ENT examination  showed no abnormal findings. The thorax X-Ray revealed a 14 cm-long foreign body  in projection to the oesophagus, which matched the knife. Following consultation  with the thorax surgeon, a rigid oesophagoscopy was conducted under endotracheal  intubation and the knife was easily removed using tongs. Archive searches  conducted in the meantime showed that foreign bodies had been removed from the  patient on numerous occasions by fellow surgeons either laparoscopically or via  open surgery. As a result, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric ward  with unimpeded swallowing reflex with a suspected self-harming syndrome.  DISCUSSION: As an ENT emergency, a foreign body in the oesophagus generally  requires intervention because of the risk of complications such as perforation or  pressure-induced necrosis of the oesophagus wall with resulting mediastinitis.  Suitable instruments are the flexible oesophagoscope, the rigid oesophagoscope  under anaesthesia or transcervical/transthoracic removal. The choice of procedure  crucially depends on the type and localisation of the foreign body in the  oesophagus.

The majority of foreign bodies are  passed smoothly with no problems if they passed the esophagus, however some may  be lodged in areas of anatomical narrowing which may require endoscopic or  surgical intervention. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year -old mentally abnormal woman  presented to the emergency department complaining from abdominal pain for 2 days.  The family reported a history of ingestion of multiple metallic nails one week  before presentation. Abdominal examination showed generalized tenderness and  guarding. Plain abdominal X-ray showed multiple metallic nails in the upper  abdomen and the right lower abdomen. Laparotomy was performed, one of the nails  was causing perforation of the gastric wall, huge number of metallic nails were  extracted from the stomach and cecum, appendectomy was performed.

We present a case in a 44-year-old female with an eyeliner pencil self-introduced  into the urethra. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient was referred to us with a  recent history of ""ingestion of foreign body"". The clinical presentation,  radiologic data, and treatment were reported. RESULTS: The patient had a pencil  placed sideways in the urinary bladder, with focal perforation of the left wall.  A cystoscopy was performed and the pencil was removed at the same time by using  grasping forceps and hydraulic overdistention of the urinary bladder.  CONCLUSIONS: Bladder is the most common location of foreign bodies of the  urogenital tract, almost always due to self-insertion into the urethra for the  purpose of masturbation or as a result of non-inhibited or altered behavior due  to psychiatric diseases, or to the influence of drugs. Most patients were too  ashamed to admit they had inserted or applied any object and usually presented  when a complication had occurred such as difficulty in voiding, hematuria, pain  or swelling, extravasations or abscess formation.

No similar case of internal injuries following  unintentional ingestion of a barbecue grill cleaning brush bristle has been  reported. A 58-year-old Caucasian male with no significant history presented with  complaint of halitosis, not improving after oral care and dental hygiene  measures. He denied any other symptoms. After ruling out oral causes of  halitosis, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, which revealed a black  wire-shaped metallic FB embedded in the duodenum. The FB was identified as a  silver metallic flexible wire resembling the bristle of a barbecue grill cleaning  brush. The halitosis resolved completely within 3 weeks of the removal of the FB.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of duodenal impaction of a  barbecue grill cleaning brush bristle atypically presenting with halitosis.  Physicians' awareness of this potential injury from grill cleaning brush bristles  would lead to a quick diagnosis after a focused history. Also avid grillers must  be made aware of this potential hazard and should be encouraged to carefully  examine the barbecue grill surface for any remnant bristle of the grill cleaning  brush. Appropriate history taking, considering GI causes as potentially inducing  halitosis, and an awareness of this entity among providers are important to  facilitate prompt diagnoses and prevent major adverse outcomes.","2016-12","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","800-807","","3","10","","Case Rep Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 28203127  PMCID: PMC5260512","","","","Barbecue brush bristles; Duodenal foreign body; Food grille; Gastrointestinal foreign body; Halitosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One hundred adult patients underwent a videofluoroscopic evaluation  of aspiration with either an esophagram (n = 31), upper gastrointestinal series  (n = 18), small bowel series (n = 23), or modified barium swallow procedure (n =  28), and concomitant evaluation of the gag reflex and velar movement on  phonation. All studies were performed using the lateral, upright position, and  all patients drank at least 5 cc of single contrast barium. Aspiration was  defined as penetration of material below the level of the true vocal folds. A  normal gag reflex and normal velar movement on phonation were observed in 14 of  15 (93%) patients who exhibited objective documentation of aspiration with  videofluoroscopy. Conversely, 19 of 20 (95%) patients without a gag reflex were  observed with videofluoroscopy to be without aspiration. Normal velar movement on  phonation was observed in 99 of 100 (99%) patients. There was no significant age  difference between patients with or without a gag reflex. No relationship was  found between the prevalence of aspiration and the gag reflex or velar movement  on phonation.

This approach combines  the established bedside endoscopic swallowing evaluation with a more recently  described technique that allows objective determination of laryngopharyngeal (LP)  sensory discrimination thresholds by delivering air pulse stimuli to the mucosa  innervated by the superior laryngeal nerve via a flexible endoscope. A  prospective study was conducted of FEESST in 20 healthy control subjects, mean  age of 34 +/- 11 years. LP sensory thresholds were defined as either normal (<  4.0 mmHg air pulse pressure [APP]), moderate deficit (4.0-6.0 mmHg APP), or  severe deficits (> 6.0 mmHg APP). Subsequent to LP sensory testing, food of  varying consistencies, mixed with green food coloring, was given and attention  was paid to spillage, laryngeal penetration, pharyngeal residue, aspiration, and  reflux. Therapeutic maneuvers such as postural changes and airway protection  techniques were performed on each subject to determine if the assessed swallowing  parameters were affected by maneuvers. All patients completed the study; all had  normal LP sensory discrimination thresholds (2.9 +/- 0.7 mmHg APP). There were no  instances of spillage, laryngeal penetration, or aspiration. Two of 20 subjects  had pharyngeal residue and 2 of 20 had reflux. Institution of therapeutic  maneuvers resulted in a predictable change in the endoscopic view of the  laryngopharyngeal anatomy. FEESST provides comprehensive, objective sensory and  motor information about deglutition in the bedside setting and might have  implications for the bedside diagnosis and management of patients with dysphagia.","1998","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","87-92","","2","13","","Dysphagia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9513302","","","","Adult; Air; Deglutition Disorders/diagnosis/etiology; Deglutition/*physiology; Differential Threshold/physiology; Eating; Endoscopy/*methods; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Female; Fiber Optic Technology; Food; Foreign Bodies/etiology; Humans; Laryngeal Mucosa/innervation/physiology; Laryngeal Nerves/physiology; Larynx/physiology; Male; Patients' Rooms; Pharynx/innervation/physiology; Physical Stimulation; Posture; Prospective Studies; Reaction Time/physiology; Reflex/physiology; Sensation/*physiology; Sensory Thresholds/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, a  case of perforation of the sigmoid colon is described, caused by a toothpick  ingestion. The patient had to be surgically treated because of a complication:  the formation of an entero-iliac fistula with subsequent development of a  pseudoaneurysm of the right external iliac artery. Vascular perforation due to  toothpick ingestion has rarely been reported.

The purpose of this study is to utilize a comprehensive database to  describe the epidemiology of pediatric injuries at a tertiary hospital in Malawi.  METHODS: Data were prospectively collected on patients presenting to the  emergency department for treatment of injuries from 2008 to 2010 (n = 23,625).  The subset of pediatric patients (n = 7233) underwent cross-sectional analysis to  examine demographics, injury environment, timing and mechanisms. RESULTS:  Pediatric patients, (0-16 years) comprised 30.6% of all trauma patients. Mean age  was 7.2 years. Falls were the most common injury (43%), followed by burns  (11.1%), pedestrian road traffic injuries (9.7%), foreign bodies (7.5%), and  assaults (7.2%). Statistically significant differences in injury pattern were  observed between gender, age groups and season. After logistic regression,  predictors of fall included male gender, home setting, and rainy season, whereas  predictors of burn included female gender, age 0-5 yrs, home setting, and cold  season. Predictors of pedestrian injury included age 6-10 yrs, female, and  roadside setting. Predictors of foreign body ingestion included age 0-5 yrs,  female gender, home setting, and daytime, and predictors of assault include male  gender, age 11-16 yrs, nighttime hours. All predictors were statistically  significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed patterns of injury based  upon age, gender, location, and season.

METHODS: A  new CR2032 BB and artificial saliva were placed in a fresh pig esophagus with the  recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN); the negative electrode faced the nerve in the  experimental group, while the positive electrode faced the nerve in the control  group. The pH values of the intra- and extraesophageal walls were measured  simultaneously. Pathological examination was performed after the esophagus and  nerves were damaged. RESULTS: After BB ingestion, the pH near the intraesophageal  negative electrode increased rapidly, reaching 11.5 at 30 min and over 14 at 6 h,  while the extraesophageal pH did not change at 1 h and began to accelerate after  2 h, reaching 10 at 6 h. After 6 h of exposure, the pathological section showed  that the structure of the mucosa, submucosa, and muscle layer were destroyed;  chromatin in the nucleus faded, and part of the nerve bundle in the adventitia  had liquefaction necrosis. CONCLUSION: The basic mechanism of vocal cord  paralysis caused by BB ingestion is that the OH(-) generated by the electrolytic  reaction of the negative electrode penetrates the esophageal wall and corrodes  the RLN, which may be the cause of vocal cord paralysis caused by BB ingestion  without esophageal perforation.","2024-02","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","111872","","","177","","Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

It has attracted great interest among mental health  professionals over the last decades. However, this issue is rarely reported in  the literature. A deep exploration of its clinical and specific  psychopathological aspects remains limited. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a  32-year-old female patient, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for homicide  against her cousin, the daughter of an uncle who had raped her when she was 14.  This affair was hushed by the patient's family and the patient was submitted to  several acts of abuse by her family. Following her incarceration, she repeatedly  ingested metallic objects requiring repeated admissions in a department of  surgery for endoscopic extractions or surgical interventions. She impulsively  ingested more than 30 times various metallic objects such as wire, razor blades,  spoons, etc., under the pressure of impulsiveness and massive anxiety. Voluntary  metal ingestions, associated with iterative self-mutilation behaviors, took place  within the framework of a borderline personality disorder, the incarceration and  the conditions of imprisonment playing a role in initiating and retaining the  behavior. CONCLUSION: Through this case report, we examine the specific  psychiatric aspects of intentional ingestion of metallic objects in order to  better understand this behavior.","2015-02","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","78-83","","1","41","","Encephale","","","","","","","","fre","Copyright © 2013.

Methods: 140 patients who underwent barbed reposition  pharyngoplasty (BRP) surgery in the Morgagni Pierantoni Hospital of Forlì, Italy  were enrolled in the study. Postoperative outcomes were evaluated in a short- and  long-term follow-up using the PPOPS questionnaire. The average period of  follow-up was 26 months. All patients received the PPOPS questionnaire by  telephone in a period between April and August 2019. Results: 51% of patients  complained of swallowing problems after surgery. In 91% of cases, the problem  cleared up spontaneously. At the time of the interview, only 9% of patients had a  residual swallowing difficult. At the time of PPOPS evaluation, rhinolalia was  observed in 8% of patients, whereas nose regurgitation was present in 2% of  patients. In 20% of patients, the foreign body sensation was present during  follow-up. The value of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) reduced from the preoperative  value of 31.5 to the postoperative value of 11.4.

STUDY  DESIGN: Prospective study. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with oropharyngeal  dysphagia underwent videoendoscopy of swallowing to assess pharyngeal propulsion  as pathologic or nonpathologic, and aspiration. These features were compared with  those found on manometry and videofluoroscopy, which were considered as the  reference examinations. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative  predictive values of videoendoscopy were estimated, with their 95% confidence  intervals. RESULTS: A total agreement between videoendoscopy and videofluoroscopy  was found in 76.4% of cases for pharyngeal propulsion and in 82.3% for  aspiration. This rate for pharyngeal propulsion reached 82.3% between  videoendoscopy and manometry. Moreover, in 24 cases (70.5%) in which  videofluoroscopy and manometry agreed for pharyngeal propulsion, 22 were assessed  similarly through fiberoscopy. When using fluoroscopy and manometry as reference  examinations, videoendoscopy detected nearly 90% (95% confidence interval [CI] =  0.80, 1.0) of impaired pharyngeal propulsion. Concerning aspiration, 70% (95% CI  = 0.54, 0.85) of events detected by videoendoscopy were also observed on  videofluoroscopy. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive  values of videoendoscopy reached a higher rate (90% to 92.8%) when agreement was  found between fluoroscopy and manometry.

METHODS: We  reviewed the medical records of children aged between 1 and 15 years old admitted  to Chang Gung Children's Hospital due to disc battery ingestion from September  1997 through July 2003). The diagnosis of disc battery ingestion was based upon  history, clinical symptoms, and results of imaging studies. The clinical data  reviewed included sex, age, clinical manifestation, hospital course, imaging  findings, and endoscopic results. RESULTS: We found 12 cases (8 males and 4  females) of disc battery ingestion with a mean age of 1.8 +/- 3.43 years (range,  9 months to 5 years). Two patients had symptoms of vomiting, nausea, and  abdominal pain. Two cases with no history of disc battery ingestion and were  accidentally found by X ray studies. Four cases had their batteries impacted in  the esophagus and eight cases had their batteries impacted in stomach. In those  patients with esophageal impaction, one died suddenly, and the batteries were  removed successfully by endoscope in the other three. Among those patients with  batteries in the stomach, two patients underwent endoscope removal and the other  6 patients experienced smooth courses and the batteries spontaneously passed  through the gastrointestinal tract within 5 days. The diameter of the ingested  disc batteries ranged from 12 mm to 23 mm. The duration of hospitalization varied  from 1 day to 61 days. Four patients had obvious damage of gastrointestinal  mucosa including three esophageal mucosal erosion lesions, and one gastric mucosa  erosion lesions with hemorrhage. Two patients experienced complications: one died  suddenly due to tension in the pneumothorax and penumoperitoneum and the other  had tracheoesophageal fistula. CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of disc battery ingestion  run uneventful courses. However, the ingestion of some disc batteries may be  fatal or complicated with life-threatening events. If the battery impacts in the  esophagus, emergency endoscopic management is necessary. Once in the stomach, the  battery will usually pass through the gastrointestinal tract without long-term  complications.","2004-09","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","673-677","","9","27","","Chang Gung Med J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: China (Republic : 1949- ) PMID: 15605907","","","","Child, Preschool; Electric Power Supplies; Endoscopes, Gastrointestinal; Female; Foreign Bodies/*complications/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging; Foreign-Body Reaction/*etiology/pathology; Hospitals; Humans; Infant; Male; Prognosis; Radiography; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several cases have been reported in the medical literature, and the  diagnostic and therapeutic approaches must be applied in a multifaceted and  differentiated manner. CASE REPORT: Our case concerns a 54-year-old female with  accidental swallowing of a needle. We describe our diagnostic procedure with  laparoscopic removal of the appendix due to fixation of the object in the right  lower abdomen. DISCUSSION: The ingestion of foreign bodies is an old medical  problem, although its incidence has decreased drastically due to changes in  lifestyles. Today, it is rather the unusual cases and intentional ingestion that  are in the forefront. Initial endoscopic treatment attempts are followed by the  ""wait-and-see"" attitude in hopes of spontaneous passage that can be monitored via  radiological methods. If the object does not pass naturally and is localized in  the colon, what remains as a treatment option is endoscopy followed by surgery  that can be performed in a minimally invasive manner.","2008-09","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","338-342","","3","12","","JSLS","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18765067  PMCID: PMC3015868","","","","*Needles; Appendix/diagnostic imaging/*surgery; Female; Foreign Bodies/diagnostic imaging/*surgery; Humans; Laparoscopy/*methods; Middle Aged; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: As part of a larger study of  the effects of retained lead bullets on blood lead, a retrospective review of  study findings was completed on 5 of 8 patients who sustained injuries to the  maxillofacial region. These 5 patients were recruited into the larger study  within 11 days of injury and showed a penetration path for the projectile that  engaged the upper aerodigestive tract. All subjects were recruited from patients  presenting for care of their gunshot injuries to a large inner-city trauma center  with a retained bullet resulting from a gunshot injury. An initial blood lead  level was measured for all recruited patients and repeated 1 to 17 weeks later.  Medical history was taken along with a screening and risk factor questionnaire to  determine other potential or actual sources (occupational/recreational) of lead  exposure. (109)Cd K-shell x-ray fluorescence determinations of bone lead were  completed to determine past lead exposure not revealed by medical history and  risk factor questionnaire. Radiographs taken of the abdomen and chest, required  as a part of the patient's hospital care, were retrospectively reviewed for signs  of metallic fragments along the aerodigestive tract. RESULTS: All 5 patients  retained multiple lead pellets or fragments at the site of injury, sustained  fractures of the facial bones, and showed increases in blood lead. Three of the 5  study subjects who sustained maxillofacial gunshot injuries involving the mouth,  nose, or throat region showed metallic densities along the gastrointestinal tract  indicative of ingested bullet fragments. Each patient with ingested bullet  fragments showed rapid elevation of blood lead exceeding 25 microg/dL and  sustained increases well beyond the time when all ingested fragments were  eliminated. A 3-year follow-up on these 3 patients showed significantly sustained  elevation of blood lead but less than that observed during the initial 6 months  after injury. None of the 5 study subjects showed any evidence of metallic  foreign bodies within the tracheobronchial regions indicative of aspiration.  CONCLUSION: Ingestion of lead fragments can result from gunshot injuries to the  maxillofacial region and may substantially contribute to a rapid increase in  blood lead level. Prompt diagnosis and elimination of ingested lead fragments are  essential steps necessary to prevent lead being absorbed from the  gastrointestinal tract. Increased blood lead in victims after gunshot injuries  must be fully evaluated for all potential sources, including recent environmental  exposure, absorption of lead from any remaining bullets in body tissues, and the  possibility of mobilization of lead from long-term body stores such as bone.","2003-05","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","593-603","","5","61","","J Oral Maxillofac Surg","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2003 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12730839","","","","Adult; Calcaneus/chemistry; Confidence Intervals; Environmental Exposure; Facial Bones/injuries; Follow-Up Studies; Foreign Bodies/blood/diagnostic imaging; Humans; Lead/analysis/*blood; Male; Maxillofacial Injuries/*blood; Mouth/injuries; Nose/injuries; Occupational Exposure; Pharynx/injuries; Radiography; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Skull Fractures/blood; Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission; Tibia/chemistry; Wounds, Gunshot/*blood/diagnostic imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Normal  values of this ratio have been established for subjects of different ethnicity,  but the differences between genders and race have not been critically compared.  PURPOSE: To establish normal cervical spinal dimensions and analyze the  differences observed between men and women, and between reports using subjects of  different ethnicity. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Observational. PATIENT SAMPLE: Forty  men and 40 women of Chinese descent with no history or symptoms of neck pathology  selected from patients presenting to the Emergency Department for foreign body  ingestion. OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements of the sagittal developmental diameter  (SDD) and vertebral body diameter (VB) on the lateral cervical radiograph with  calculation of SDD/VB (Torg ratio). METHODS: Lateral radiographs of the cervical  spine were taken in a standardized manner with a 180-cm film-to-tube distance.  Comparison was made between genders in the study population and with previous  reports on subjects of different ethnicity. RESULTS: The SDD was narrowest at the  C4 level in both men and women. Women had smaller SDDs at all levels of the  cervical spine. Female VBs were of sizes similar to their corresponding SDDs,  whereas men had larger VBs. This resulted in small Torg ratios in men averaging  0.87. Comparison with previous reports demonstrated consistent variation in the  SDD, which increased serially from Japanese, through Chinese and Indian, to white  subjects. The relationship of VB to the corresponding SDD displayed wide  variation between reports. This resulted in Torg ratios differing not only  between subjects of different ethnicity but also between genders within the same  population. CONCLUSIONS: The Torg ratio is not a consistent indicator of the SDD  and may not be used to reliably identify the presence of cervical canal stenosis.","2004-08","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","396-401","","4","4","","Spine J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15246298","","","","*Asian People; Adult; Cervical Vertebrae/*anatomy & histology/physiology; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sex Factors; Spinal Canal/*anatomy & histology; Spinal Stenosis/*diagnosis/*ethnology; Spine/anatomy & histology/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Management approaches include endoscopic or open surgical  repair. Unfortunately, these procedures can be complicated by high rates of  recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, tracheal stenosis, recurrent fistula and  significant patient mortality. Thus, several authors have advocated the use of  esophageal rest as conservative management of acquired TEF to permit closure by  secondary intention. This study describes a patient with spontaneous closure of  an acquired TEF following disc-battery ingestion. The late recurrence of the TEF  following conservative management, and endoscopic and radiographic evidence of  closure, illustrates the importance of long term evaluation before assuming  fistula resolution. Practitioners must carefully weigh the risks and benefits  before deciding surgical versus conservative management of TEF. An extended  follow-up of at least 6 months should be instituted with a high index of  suspicion if conservative management is utilized. Transtracheal repair using an  imbricated suture technique is a good surgical option when conservative  management fails.","2008-05","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","699-706","","5","72","","Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Ireland PMID: 18316130","","","","*Esophagus; Child, Preschool; Electric Power Supplies; Female; Foreign Bodies/*complications; Humans; Recurrence; Tracheoesophageal Fistula/etiology/surgery/*therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to  evaluate the ability of WBI, with and without metoclopramide pretreatment, to  clear the GI tract of foreign bodies using previously established WBI end points,  ie, the presence of a clear effluent or the administration of 2 L/h PEG-ELS for 5  hours. Eleven healthy, adult, male volunteers participated in this controlled,  two-phase, blinded, crossover study. Ten fluorescent coffee beans were ingested  after an overnight fast followed 1 hour later by 10 mg of metoclopramide syrup or  an equivalent volume of placebo; 30 minutes later, WBI with PEG-ELS was begun at  2 L/h. All volunteers received 10 L of PEG-ELS during a 5-hour period. No  statistically significant difference (P > .05) was found between the two  pretreatments. For the metoclopramide group, the mean number of beans passed was  equal to 3.8 (+/- 2.5 standard deviation [SD]; 1 to 8 R); the mean number at  clear effluent was equal to 2.3. For the placebo group, the mean number of beans  passed was equal to 3.5 (+/- 1.9 SD; 2 to 7 R), and the mean number at clear  effluent was equal to 2.3. In conclusion, the presence of a clear effluent or the  administration of 10 L of PEG-ELS are not valid markers for the termination of  WBI if complete elimination of a foreign body is required.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient (75 years old) was operated on  for cervical myelopathia due to cervical stenosis. Surgical treatment included an  anterior release with corporectomy of C4, C5 and C6 and iliac graft insertion,  and fixation using plate and screws. Immediate post-operative course was  uneventful. Plate incurvation and rupture were observed during the second  post-operative month, with partial anterior migration of the lower screw. As the  patient complained of dysphagia, removal of osteosynthesis was decided and  scheduled 3 days later; however the screw was missing on a pre-operative  radiograph. It was found on a routine abdominal X-Ray, and it passed out during  the following week. Dysphagia disappeared in a few days and removal of  osteosynthesis was given up for fear of oesophageal complications. Further  evolution was favourable. Cervical fusion was obtained uneventfully.  Post-operative myelmogram showed a good canal enlargement. The patient was  temporarily lost for follow-up and was asked for review 2 years later. Mild  difficulty in swallowing saliva was still present without dysphagia. On routine  cervical X-Rays another screw had disappeared again. Oesophagoscopy was proposed  but not accepted by the patient because he felt not significantly disturbed.  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Complications associated with oesophageal perforation  may range from massive infection and death to spontaneous resolution. Erosion due  to extruded bulky constructs leads to persistent fistula with abscess or septic  diffusion. Perforation due to complete migration of small foreign bodies like  screws gives possibility of spontaneous oesophageal closure and healing without  significant morbidity. The spontaneous recurrent elimination of 2 screws gives to  this observation a very outstanding feature.","1997","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","78-82","","1","83","","Rev Chir Orthop Reparatrice Appar Mot","","","","","","","","fre","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 9161553","","","","*Bone Screws; Aged; Cervical Vertebrae; Deglutition Disorders/etiology; Esophagus; Follow-Up Studies; Foreign-Body Migration/*etiology; Humans; Male; Osteoarthritis/complications; Spinal Cord Compression/etiology/*surgery; Spinal Fusion/*adverse effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typically having ingested a fish or chicken bone, the patient complains of chest  pain or discomfort and/or may present with massive gastrointestinal bleeding,  which in all but rare cases is fatal. The pathological mechanism may involve  perforation and direct communication of oesophagus and aorta usually at the level  of the aortic arch; or more usually following oesophageal perforation, the  subsequent mediastinal abscess leads to necrosis of the aortic wall. Torrential  haemothorax as a result of such a process has not been previously described,  though it has undoubtedly occurred. We present a case of massive haemothorax  following deliberate ingestion of razorblades that highlights clinically and  radiologically the natural course of such a tragic action.","2007-05","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","946-948","","5","31","","Eur J Cardiothorac Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 17346984","","","","Adult; Aortic Diseases/diagnostic imaging/*etiology; Deglutition; Esophageal Fistula/diagnostic imaging/*etiology; Fatal Outcome; Female; Foreign Bodies/*complications/diagnostic imaging; Hemothorax/diagnostic imaging/*etiology; Household Articles; Humans; Radiography; Vascular Fistula/diagnostic imaging/*etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A 30-month-old boy whose eye had been enucleated for  retinoblastoma swallowed his ocular prosthesis on 2 different occasions, and a  32-month-old boy whose eye had also been enucleated for retinoblastoma swallowed  his ocular prosthesis once. RESULTS: In the second child, an abdominal radiograph  was obtained, but the swallowed prosthesis was not apparent, and radiographic  imaging of the recovered prosthesis failed to demonstrate an identifiable object.  In each case, the prosthesis was recovered in the child's stool without incident  several weeks later. Neither child had physical complications as a result of the  swallowing events. CONCLUSIONS: We report 3 instances in which a child fitted for  an ocular prosthesis after enucleation swallowed his prosthesis and had no  untoward effects. The failure of imaging to detect the prostheses in the second  child is attributed to the radiolucent nature of materials used in the  manufacture of the prosthesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen expandable covered metallic stents  were placed with fluoroscopic guidance in 16 patients (14 men, two women; mean  age, 60 years; age range, 26-75 years) with malignant and benign strictures of  the cervical esophagus. The causes of strictures were ingestion of corrosive  agents (n = 3), biopsy-proved squamous cell carcinoma (n = 12), and postsurgical  scarring (n = 1). The mean dysphagia scores at presentation were compared with  those after stent placement by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS:  Stent placement was technically successful in all patients. The reduction in the  mean dysphagia score after stent placement was statistically significant (P =  .0327). All patients complained of mild to severe foreign body sensation, with  four reporting severe pain necessitating immediate stent removal. With the  exception of one patient with limited follow-up, complications requiring  intervention occurred in all patients, including migration in nine patients and  tissue hyperproliferation in two. Of the 12 patients with a malignant stricture  of the esophagus, four patients eventually underwent gastrostomy for the  placement of a feeding tube and one patient underwent surgery. All four patients  with a benign cervical stricture failed to achieve long-lasting improvement with  temporary stent placement. CONCLUSIONS: Although the placement of covered  metallic stents in the cervical esophagus provides adequate initial palliation,  it is associated with poor patient tolerance and a high complication rate.","2007-07","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","888-895","","7","18","","J Vasc Interv Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17609449","","","","*Stents/adverse effects; Adult; Aged; Esophageal Neoplasms/complications; Esophageal Stenosis/diagnostic imaging/etiology/*therapy; Female; Fluoroscopy; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Radiography, Interventional; Retrospective Studies; Statistics, Nonparametric; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Children can ingest various foreign objects. One of such objects is safety pin,  which is not widely reported in the literature. The purpose of this study is to  consider the efficacy of Magill forceps for removal of safety pins from upper  esophagus. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted for all children  admitted to our hospital with safety pin ingestion from 1995 to 2003. In 58  children who had been found to ingest safety pin, the attachment site was  gastrointestinal tract. In 12 of the cases, safety pins were located in the upper  end of the esophagus. In seven of the children safety pin extraction was achieved  by using a Magill forceps with the assistance of a laryngoscope maintaining  general anesthesia with mask inhalation. RESULTS: Safety pins were successfully  removed with Magill forceps without any complications in seven patients whom they  were located in the upper esophagus. Upper esophageal safety pins in the other  five patients were extracted with rigid esophagoscopy for they were not seen  under direct laryngoscopy. There were no complications. CONCLUSIONS: This is a  preliminary report, but we believe that the Magill forceps technique for the  removal of safety pin in the upper end of the esophagus is safe and minimally  invasive method compared to rigid esophagoscopy.","2004-09","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","1189-1191","","9","68","","Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Ireland PMID: 15302151","","","","*Esophagus; *Surgical Instruments; Child; Esophagoscopy/*methods; Female; Foreign Bodies/*surgery; Humans; Male; Retrospective Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since 2003, CPSC staff  members have identified one death resulting from ingestion of these magnets and  19 other cases of injuries requiring gastrointestinal surgery. This report  describes three selected cases and summarizes the 20 cases of magnet ingestion  identified by CPSC that occurred during 2003-2006. Caregivers should keep small  magnets away from young children and be aware of the unique risks (e.g., volvulus  and bowel perforation) that magnets pose if ingested.

The initial focus was on  the 31 radionuclides described in different International Commission on  Radiological Protection models (HRTM, HAT) and the National Council on Radiation  Protection model (wound). Particular attention was devoted to selecting the  inorganic and organic ligands, most representative of biological media. The base  applied to speciation in solution and at interfaces and solubility (BASSIST)  thermodynamic database was developed for this purpose. The aim of this paper is  to present the state of the art on radionuclide speciation tools within  biological media and to emphasise some missing data in order to orient future  research.","2007","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","97-102","","1-4","127","","Radiat Prot Dosimetry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 17578878","","","","*Models, Biological; Body Burden; Computer Simulation; Forecasting; Foreign Bodies/complications/*physiopathology; Humans; Injections/adverse effects; Kinetics; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Plutonium/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity; Radiation Injuries/etiology/physiopathology; Radiometry/*methods/*trends; Relative Biological Effectiveness; Wounds, Penetrating/etiology/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

E.","Corrosion potential of steel bird shot in dogs.","Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association","","0003-1488","","","Each year many dogs are accidentally or purposely wounded with shotguns. When lead pellets were used exclusively in the past, clinical problems from  chronically embedded shot seldom developed except for rare cases of lead  toxicosis. However, because expended lead shot ingested unintentionally by  waterfowl and other avian species is fatal, the US Fish and Wildlife Service  mandated exclusive use of steel shot for waterfowl hunting beginning in 1991. To  discover the effects of implanted steel shot in a biological system, in vitro and  in vivo studies were performed. Severe surface corrosion was evident when steel  shot was placed in physiologic saline solution and sterile canine plasma. Eight  laboratory dogs were surgically implanted with sterile steel shot in various  superficial locations for intervals of 2 to 26 weeks. Corrosion of implants and  tissue inflammation was observed in all biopsy specimens examined. It has been  shown that steel shot embedded in tissues will corrode and result in a severe  inflammatory response. If the accompanying inflammation is complicated by  bacterial contamination, foreign body reactions resulting in infected, draining  tracts could develop. Veterinarians and dog owners should be aware that treatment  and prognosis for wounds caused by steel shot may differ from those for similar  wounds caused by lead shot.","1991-10-01","2024-12-18 04:02:31","2024-12-18 04:02:31","","856-863","","7","199","","J Am Vet Med Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1769870","","","","Animals; Blood Cells/drug effects; Blood Chemical Analysis/veterinary; Connective Tissue/pathology; Dog Diseases/*chemically induced/pathology; Dogs; Inflammation/chemically induced/*veterinary; Joint Diseases/chemically induced/veterinary; Muscles/pathology; Steel/*adverse effects; Wounds, Gunshot/complications/pathology/*veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we report a case of ingestion of a rolled, metal tuna can lid  in a male prison inmate previously diagnosed with depression and paranoid  schizophrenia. Following evaluation by the surgical team, the foreign body was  removed by laparotomy and the patient was discharged back to the prison without  complication. In many cases, ingestions ofthis type involve a command  hallucination ordering the patient to swallow the foreign body.
