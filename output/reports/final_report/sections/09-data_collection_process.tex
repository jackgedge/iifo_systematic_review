\subsection*{Data Collection Process}
Data were extracted by a single reviewer (JGE) into an Excel spreadsheet. Variables for extraction were developed through an iterative process of engaging with the literature and identifying consistent patterns in the data reported. A preliminary analysis of the first 30 case reports informed the development of additional data categories, which were subsequently applied to the remaining reports. Once the case report data were extracted, these structured variables were used to guide the extraction of aggregate data from case series. Studies were grouped for extraction according to their classification as case reports or case series. Where case series contained sufficiently granular data, cases were extracted individually and treated as case reports; otherwise, data were extracted at the aggregate level. Case grouping for analysis was based on whether they met criteria for inclusion as individual case reports or case series, as defined above. Relevant data from reviews and other literature types were recorded under the case report category.
