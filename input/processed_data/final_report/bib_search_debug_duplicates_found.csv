Some foreign objects (eg, an object that has been swallowed either intentionally or unintentionally) are the cause of the patient's signs and symptoms and require prompt medical attention. Other objects, such as a sponge or surgical instrument that has been retained postoperatively, may have medicolegal consequences. Furthermore, certain objects, such as intentionally concealed drug packets, may go undetected unless a high degree of suspicion exists and appropriate window settings are used to review the study.

In this report, we present a rare case of razor blades lodged in the appendix as a result of intentional ingestion. Presentation of case A 25 year old male prisoner presented to our hospital with persistent right iliac fossa pain after razor blade ingestion. After 5 days of conservative management, there was no sign of transition on serial X-Rays. Laparoscopy with intraoperative image intensification confirmed the presence of the razor blades in the appendix and appendicectomy was subsequently performed without complications. Discussion Most ingested objected with diameter less than 2.5 cm and length less than 6 cm can pass through the gastrointestinal tract spontaneously in less than one week. The entry of foreign objects into the appendix is thought to be due to relative low motility of the caecum, the dependent position of the appendix and the size of the appendiceal orifice. Radiographic localisation to the appendiceal lumen was complicated by metallic artefact, but was consistent with failure to transit. Appendicectomy was felt to be the safest mode of retrieval. Conclusion Ingested foreign body lodged in the appendix is a rare event. Once the exact location is confirmed, a simple laparoscopic appendicectomy can be performed to facilitate the removal.",2018-01-01,2025-04-14 14:34:52,2025-04-14 14:34:52,2025-04-14 14:34:52,29-32,,,45.0,,International Journal of Surgery Case Reports,Ingested razor blades within the appendix,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/47T66669/Cui et al. - 2018 - Ingested razor blades within the appendix A rare .pdf; /Users/jackgedge/Zotero/storage/6KCXN4ID/S2210261218300981.html,,,Laparoscopy; Case report; Foreign body ingestion; Appendicectomy; Appendicitis; Razor blades,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,662,ingested razor blades within the appendix: a rare case report,10.1016/j.ijscr.2018.03.018

This potentially severe problem had a peak incidence in children aged 6 months to 6 years. Intentional adult cases are voluntary and more common in prisoners and people with psychiatric problems. However, most patients (90%) remain asymptomatic, and these pass through the body spontaneously.

Furthermore, the authors have reviewed the available literature for similar cases. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Less than 1% of patients need surgical removal, 10-20% need to be taken out endoscopically, and the remaining pass spontaneously. Plain radiography is the most available imaging modality detecting the number, material, and estimated place of the alimentary canal trapped.
