It is associated with serious physical complications, including bowel obstruction, perforation and haemorrhage. Episodes of deliberate foreign body ingestion were identified retrospectively from 5417 incident records from two inpatient forensic services (one mental health and one intellectual disability) over a one year timeframe, using related search terms. Rates were compared according to gender, diagnosis and level of security. Incidents of deliberate foreign body ingestion were found to occur on average every 2.7 days across the study population, with 133 incidents recorded over a one year period, accounted for by 27 patients. Women and patients in lower levels of security were significantly more likely to engage in deliberate foreign body ingestion. Staff responses to this behaviour were highly variable. Deliberate foreign body ingestion occurs frequently within inpatient forensic services, and can have significantly detrimental physical implications for affected patients. Further research should investigate the psychiatric and intellectual disability profile of such individuals in further detail, as well as exploring patient narratives; both of which will help inform development of treatment strategies. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Foreign body;

In China, there have been a few studies investigating the prevalence of DSH in heroin-dependent patients (HDPs), but their rates varied widely. We thus conducted a meta-analysis of studies assessing the prevalence of DSH among Chinese HDPs. Methods: Relevant studies were retrieved from major Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang data, and SinoMed) and western databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycInfo). Two authors independently identified eligible studies and extracted data. Studies that included a representative sample of Chinese HDPs and ascertained DSH caseness in a reliable way were considered as high quality. Statistical analysis was performed using R software. Results: In total, 15 eligible studies with a total of 37,243 Chinese HDPs were included. All included studies were conducted in heroin detoxification settings. Only two studies were rated as high quality. The pooled prevalence of DSH in Chinese HDPs was 4.4% (95%CI: 2.9, 6.2%), but the heterogeneity of prevalence rates across studies was significant (I2 = 98%, P < 0.001). Studies rated as high quality had significantly higher prevalence of DSH than those rated as low quality (13.2 vs. 3.4%, P < 0.001). Swallowing foreign objects was the most common method of DSH, with a combined prevalence of 2.7% (95%CI: 1.6, 4.4%). Extreme DSH methods such as cutting offfingers and jumping from height were also not uncommon in this patient population. Conclusion: Due to methodological problems in available studies, we find a relatively low prevalence of DSH among Chinese HDPs receiving detoxification treatment. Nevertheless, the self-harmers of Chinese HDPs are more likely to harm themselves in a dangerous or life-threatening way. Restricting the availability of DSH methods may be an effective way to prevent or reduce DSH in China's detoxification treatment settings. © 2018 Zhong, Xu, Xie, Chen and Lu.","Deliberate self-harm; Detoxification;

When featured in the literature, it has been typically discussed in medical subdisciplines, such as emergency medicine, surgery, gastroenterology, and urology. However, in-depth exploration of this multidimensional phenomenon in the field of psychiatry has thus far been limited. This article presents illustrative clinical vignettes from forensic practice of deliberate ingestion/insertion of objects and then examines specific aspects of this behavior that are critical to achieving a better understanding of it. The clinical, legal, and ethics-related implications surrounding this conduct are also explored. By taking a comprehensive approach, the aim is to foster a greater appreciation of this syndrome by clinicians and ultimately to arrive at improved practice guidelines surrounding these cases, including a more informed therapeutic plan and an enhanced management approach.","","Adult;

Her medical history included an emotionally unstable (borderline) personality disorder and she was currently an inpatient in a psychiatric hospital. She had multiple accident and emergency attendances with previous episodes of self-harm. Clinical examination revealed evidence of trauma to her midline laparotomy scar with congealed blood covering the puncture site. Her abdomen was soft and non-tender on palpation. A chest radiograph revealed no air beneath her diaphragm and her abdominal radiograph identified a radiopacity in her upper right abdomen and dilated loops of small bowel. CT of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed two pens, with the lower pen tip reaching the pancreas. A midline laparotomy was performed and both foreign bodies were extricated unremarkably. The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful. The second case involves a 22-year-old woman, a psychiatric hospital resident, presenting to the accident and emergency department 5 h after deliberately inserting the metal nib and inner plastic ink containing tube of a pen through her umbilicus. Her medical history included an emotionally unstable (borderline) personality disorder and paranoid schizophrenia. She had multiple accident and emergency department attendances with previous episodes of self-harm. Clinical examination revealed a soft, non-tender abdomen. Her chest radiograph was unremarkable and her abdominal radiograph identified a radiopaque foreign body at the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.

Adolescents and young adults may carry out this act to hurt themselves or even suicide. Often, most reports related to deliberate swallowing are typically either surgical or gastrointestinal and rarely are found in psychiatric articles; more often, the swallowed foreign objects (80 - 90%) are disposed of spontaneously, and 10 - 20% of them require endoscopy for more study and less than 1% of them need surgery to be removed or its complications. Case Presentation: The presented patient is a 17-year-old girl admitted to the psychosomatic ward of Afzalipour Hospital due to intentional poisoning. During the year before her admission, on three separate occasions, she detached the knife blade from its haft and swallowed it. She underwent laparotomy twice, one time for sigmoid tearing and damage to the left Ovary, to remove the knife and regeneration of the left ovary and sigmoid, and another time to remove the knife in order not to cause damage to her intestines. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in the world in which an ovary has been damaged. Further investigation into her background shows some extent of privation due to her family’s long-term economic problems and instability; moreover, sexual and physical abuse was also confirmed. The patient was prescribed clozapine, which decreased her suicidal behavior and attempts noticeably. Conclusions: Swallowing foreign bodies in this patient is interpreted as both self-punishment and punishing others (those who thought they were hurt or may be blamed for their despair or rejection). Intentional swallowing of foreign objects behavior is more resistant than other self-harming activities and may have a worse prognosis. Swallowing foreign objects requires a sophisticated process that, if not correctly managed, may result in serious complications; therefore, appropriate psychiatric counseling and supportive treatment are necessary for these patients. Specific to this patient eliminating the effects of suicide and reaching medical stability with a short admission was necessary.

This study aimed to analyse the circumstances of self-harm and suicide attempts in a Japanese psychiatric hospital so as to improve management and care. Methods: Incident reports of self-harm and suicide attempts during a 12.4-year period from November 2000 to March 2013 were reviewed. A descriptive analysis was conducted in terms of age, sex, and diagnosis of patients, as well as level, ward, situations, and causes of incidents. Results: During the study period, 90 cases of self-harm and attempted suicide involving 58 patients were reported. The rate of self-harm and suicide attempts was 0.05 per 1000 patient-days. The types of self-harm and suicide attempts included hanging (n = 25), wrist cutting (n = 19), ingestion of foreign objects (n = 17), and others (n = 29). The single case of completed suicide involved hanging, in a patient with schizophrenia. Among 55 patients with relevant data, the most common clinical diagnosis was mood disorder (41.8%), followed by schizophrenia (36.4%). Mood disorder was 3.5 times as prevalent in females as in males (14 vs. 4). Fourteen patients with mood disorder (n = 8) or schizophrenia (n = 6) were repeatedly involved in 46 of 89 cases of self-harm or attempted suicide; 11 were female. One woman with mood disorder attempted suicide 9 times within the same year. The top 3 management and care factors related to self-harm and suicide attempts were failure to adhere to preventive procedures (28%), insufficient therapeutic communication (28%), and difficulty in predicting suicide (20%). Conclusion: Self-harm and suicide attempts at this psychiatric hospital occurred at a rate of 0.05 per 1000 patient-days between late 2000 and early 2013. Efforts are needed to increase compliance with suicide prevention procedures and therapeutic communication, so as to improve management and care of psychiatric in-patients and prevent them from committing suicide. © 2018 Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists.","Psychiatric nursing; Risk management; Self-injurious behaviour; Suicide","Adult; Comorbidity; Female; Hospitals, Psychiatric; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Mood Disorders; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Schizophrenia; Self-Injurious Behavior; Sex Factors; Suicide, Attempted; Article; automutilation; developmental disorder; female; foreign body; hanging; human; incident report; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; mental deficiency; mental hospital; mood disorder; personality disorder; schizophrenia; sex difference; suicide attempt; wrist cutting; adult; automutilation; comorbidity; Japan; mental hospital; middle aged; mood disorder; prevalence; risk factor; schizophrenia; sex factor; statistics and numerical data; suicide attempt","","","","","","","Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020, (2013); Martelli C., Awad H., Hardy P., In-patients suicide: Epidemiology and prevention, Encephale, 36, pp. D83-D91, (2010); Neuner T., Schmid R., Wolfersdorf M., Spiessl H., Predicting inpatient suicides and suicide attempts by using clinical routine data?, Gen Hosp Psychiatry, 30, pp. 324-330, (2008); Bowers L., Banda T., Nijman H., Suicide inside: A systematic review of inpatient suicides, J Nerv Ment Dis, 198, pp. 315-328, (2010); Stewart D., Ross J., Watson C., James K., Bowers L., Patient characteristic and behaviours associated with self-harm and attempted suicide in acute psychiatric wards, J Clin Nurs, 21, pp. 1004-1013, (2012); Mendez-Bustos P., De Leon-Martinez V., Miret M., Baca-Garcia E., Lopez-Castroman J., Suicide reattempters: A systematic review, Harv Rev Psychiatry, 21, pp. 281-295, (2013); Larkin C., Di Blasi Z., Arensman E., Risk factors for repetition of self-harm: A systematic review of prospective hospital-based studies, PLoS One, 9, (2014); Wang Y., Coiera E., Runciman W., Magrabi F., Using multiclass classification to automate the identification of patient safety incident reports by type and severity, BMC Med Inform Deris Mak, 17, (2017); Guidelines for the Publication of Medical Accidents at National University Hospital, (2005); The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines, (1992); Monnin J., Thiemard E., Vandel P., Nicolier M., Tio G., Courtet P., Et al., Sociodemographic and psychopathological risk factors in repeated suicide attempts: Gender differences in a prospective study, J Affect Disord, 136, pp. 35-43, (2012); Nock M.K., Future directions for the study of suicide and self-injury, J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol, 41, pp. 255-259, (2012); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2013); Mahajan R.P., Critical incident reporting and learning, Br J Anaesth, 105, pp. 65-75, (2010)","C.

Usually the cases involve lumps of meat, bones, shards of glass, bottle tops, batteries or dentures. We would like to report about an unusual foreign body found in the oesophagus. Patient: A 45-year-old patient presented himself in our interdisciplinary casualty department where he claimed to have swallowed a butter-knife that morning as a bet. The ENT examination showed no abnormal findings. The thorax X-Ray revealed a 14 cm-long foreign body in projection to the oesophagus, which matched the knife. Following consultation with the thorax surgeon, a rigid oesophagoscopy was conducted under endotracheal intubation and the knife was easily removed using tongs. Archive searches conducted in the meantime showed that foreign bodies had been removed from the patient on numerous occasions by fellow surgeons either laparoscopically or via open surgery. As a result, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric ward with unimpeded swallowing reflex with a suspected self-harming syndrome. Discussion: As an ENT emergency, a foreign body in the oesophagus generally requires intervention because of the risk of complications such as perforation or pressure-induced necrosis of the oesophagus wall with resulting mediastinitis. Suitable instruments are the flexible oesophagoscope, the rigid oesophagoscope under anaesthesia or transcervical / transthoracic removal. The choice of procedure crucially depends on the type and localisation of the foreign body in the oesophagus. Particularly in cases of unusual foreign objects or repeated foreign object ingestion, it should be considered whether a psychological illness could be the cause and whether the introduction of appropriate therapy could be expedient. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.","Endoscopy; Foreign body; Oesophagus; Self-harm","Cooking and Eating Utensils; Esophagoscopy; Esophagus; Foreign Bodies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychiatric Department, Hospital; Recurrence; Referral and Consultation; Self-Injurious Behavior; adult; anamnesis; article; automutilation; case report; consultation; endotracheal intubation; esophagoscopy; esophagus foreign body; human; male; patient transport; priority journal; psychiatric department; risk; surgeon; swallowing; thorax radiography; esophagus; foreign body; kitchen; middle aged; patient referral; psychological aspect; radiography; recurrent disease","","","","","","","Berggreen P., Harrison E., Sanowski R., Ingebo K., Noland B., Zierer S., Techniques and complications of esophageal foreign body extraction in children and adults, Gastrointest Endosc, 39, pp. 626-630, (1993); Nandi P., Ong G., Foreign bodies in the oesophagus: Review of 2394 cases, Br J Surg, 65, pp. 5-9, (1978); Vivaldi C., Vallbohmer D., Holscher M., Holscher A., Akzidentell ingestierte Zahnprothesen-zwei Kasuistiken, Zentralbl Chir, 133, pp. 82-85, (2008); Acham A., Der interessante Fall Nr. 69, Laryngol-Rhino-Otol, 84, pp. 193-195, (2005); Bloch Y., Lauder A., Ratzoni G., How many pins?

We aimed to profile the characteristics and evaluate the care of such patients in this study. Methods: Adult patients with an endoscopic record of attempted foreign body retrieval between January 2013 and September 2020 were identified at three Australian hospitals. Those with a documented mental health diagnosis were included and their standard medical records reviewed. Presentation history, demographics, comorbidities and endoscopic findings were recorded and described. Results: A total of 166 admissions were accounted for by 35 patients, 2/3 of which had borderline personality disorder (BPD). Repetitive presentations occurred in more than half of the cohort. There was an increased trend of hospital admissions throughout the years. At least half of the cohort had a documented mental health review during their admission. An average of 3.3 (2.9) foreign bodies were ingested per single episode. Endoscopic intervention was performed in 76.5% of incidents. The combined Length of stay for all patients was 680 days. Conclusion: Deliberate foreign body ingestion in mental health patients is a common, recurring and challenging problem that is increasing in frequency and requires collaborative research to further guide holistic management. © The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2023.","Borderline personality disorder; foreign body; Personality disorders","Adult; Australia; Eating; Foreign Bodies; Humans; Mental Disorders; Retrospective Studies; adult; anorexia nervosa; anxiety; Article; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; borderline state; clinical article; cohort analysis; comorbidity; computer assisted tomography; demographics; depression; drug dependence; eating disorder; electronic medical record; endoscopy; female; foreign body; gastrointestinal surgery; health care system; hospital admission; human; information retrieval; ingestion; intellectual impairment; length of stay; male; medical care; medical record; mental disease; mental health; multicenter study; obsessive compulsive disorder; personality disorder; posttraumatic stress disorder; prospective study; psychosis; retrospective study; risk factor; schizoaffective psychosis; schizophrenia; sexual abuse; teaching hospital; Australia; clinical trial; eating; foreign body; mental disease","","","","","","","Becq A., Camus M., Dray X., Foreign body ingestion: dos and don’ts, Frontline Gastroenterology, 12, 7, pp. 664-670, (2021); Gitlin D.F., Caplan J.P., Rogers M.P., Et al., Foreign-body ingestion in patients with personality disorders, Psychosomatics, 48, 2, pp. 162-166, (2007); Huang B.L., Rich H.G., Simundson S.E., Et al., Intentional swallowing of foreign bodies is a recurrent and costly problem that rarely causes endoscopy complications, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol, 8, 11, pp. 941-946, (2010); Birk M., Removal of foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal tract in adults: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) Clinical Guideline, Endoscopy, 48, 5, (2016); AsoP C., Ikenberry S.O., Jue T.L., Et al., Management of ingested foreign bodies and food impactions, Gastrointest Endosc, 73, 6, pp. 91-1085, (2011); Palta R., Sahota A., Bemarki A., Et al., Foreign-body ingestion: characteristics and outcomes in a lower socioeconomic population with predominantly intentional ingestion, Gastrointest Endosc, 69, pp. 33-426, (2009); (2021); Yadollahi S., Buchannan R., Tehami N., Et al., Endoscopic management of intentional foreign body ingestion: experience from a UK centre, Frontline Gastroenterology, 13, 2, pp. 98-103, (2022); Palese C., Al-Kawas F.H., Repeat intentional foreign body ingestion: the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, Gastroenterol Hepatol, 8, 7, pp. 6-485, (2012); Carter G., Page A., Large M., Et al., Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists clinical practice guideline for the management of deliberate self-harm, Aust N Z J Psychiatry, 50, 10, pp. 939-1000, (2016); Karp J.G., Whitman L., Convit A., Intentional ingestion of foreign objects by male prison inmates, Hosp Community Psychiatry, 42, 5, pp. 5-533, (1991); Poynter B.A., Hunter J.J., Coverdale J.H., Et al., Hard to swallow: a systematic review of deliberate foreign body ingestion, Gen Hosp Psychiatr, 33, 5, pp. 24-518, (2011); Baker J., Beazley P.I., Judging personality disorder: a systematic review of clinician attitudes and responses to borderline personality disorder, J Psychiatr Pract, 28, 4, pp. 93-175, (2022); Leichsenring F., Heim N., Leweke F., Et al., Borderline personality disorder: a review, JAMA, 329, 8, pp. 9-670, (2023); Stoffers-Winterling J.M., Storebo O.J., Pereira Ribeiro J., Et al., Pharmacological interventions for people with borderline personality disorder, Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 11, (2022)","","","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","10398562","","AUPSF","37473424","English","Australas.

Information regarding psychiatric risk indicators was extracted from participants’ psychiatric records. Generalized linear models with negative binomial distribution and log link function, as well as chi-square tests, were used to address study aims. Clients with a lifetime atypical/severe NSSI history met criteria for a significantly greater number of psychiatric risk indicators than clients with a lifetime history of common NSSI only; however, these clients were not significantly more likely to report recent suicidal actions. Individuals with an atypical/severe NSSI history may demonstrate more severe psychopathology than those with a history of common NSSI only. Thus, it may be clinically useful to consider individuals with an atypical/severe NSSI history as a high-risk subgroup. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

These cases exhibited pervasive psychopathology of early onset, histories of severe personality disorder, and trauma. The cases seemingly presented a higher incidence of medical complications than is reported in the literature, and treatment outcomes varied from modest-to-good success. Considering these difficulties, the goal of this practice review is to shed light on the motivation and treatment of self-injury by ingestion and to consider directions where existing theory and research could inform treatment strategies in future cases. We conclude the practice review with a summary of questions that remain to be answered with future research studies and make recommendations regarding treatment of these difficult cases. © 2012 American Psychological Association..","borderline personality disorder;

While the phenomenon has been reported on, primarily from a psychiatric perspective, this report will present the effects of this behavior on the intestinal system from a pathology perspective. The report is of a 43-year-old female with a past medical history of foreign object ingestion, borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety, and prior suicidality who passed away due to bowel obstruction. Review of her history revealed an eighteen-year history of repeated foreign body ingestion with multiple surgical interventions. A particularly remarkable aspect revealed through the surgical history is the nature of the complications. They begin in 2008 with bowel perforation due to a blunt object and continue to present with perforation in the early years but show a gradual change to adhesions and obstruction as the primary concern. Her final presentation to the hospital and cause of death was due to obstruction, not perforation, even though the foreign bodies were six knives. While this case is not the only known report of foreign body ingestion, the extensive timeline and frequency allow for an examination of the gradual progression of fibrosis and adhesions within the intestines and abdominal wall, which led to the obstruction and death despite being a protective factor against further perforation. © 2024 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.","","Adult; Fatal Outcome; Female; Fibrosis; Foreign Bodies; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Intestinal Perforation; Intestines; abdomen; abdominal cavity; abdominal pain; abdominal wall; abdominal wall hernia; abscess drainage; adhesion; adult; anastomosis leakage; anxiety disorder; Article; autopsy; borderline state; bronchoscopy; case report; cause of death; cecum resection; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; depression; disease exacerbation; duodenum; duodenum perforation; esophagoduodenoscopy; esophagus perforation; fatality; female; forearm; foreign body; gastrotomy; hernioplasty; human; incision; ingestion; intestinal fibrosis; intestine endoscopy; intestine obstruction; intestine perforation; intestine surgery; intoxication; laparotomy; liver; lung; medical history; nausea and vomiting; neck; pancreas abscess; patient history of surgery; peritonitis; scar; small intestine obstruction; small intestine resection; spleen; stomach; suicidal behavior; suicide attempt; thorax pain; tissue adhesion; complication; etiology; fibrosis; injury; intestine; pathology; surgery","","","","","","","Ambe PC, Weber SA, Schauer M, Knoefel WT., Swallowed foreign bodies in adults, Deutsches Ärzteblatt International, (2012); Becq A, Camus M, Dray X., Foreign body ingestion: dos and don’ts, Frontline Gastroenterology, 12, 7, pp. 664-670, (2020); Ikenberry SO, Jue TL, Anderson MA, Et al., Management of ingested foreign bodies and food impactions, Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, 73, 6, pp. 1085-1091, (2011); Eisen GM, Baron TH, Dominitz JA, Et al., Guideline for the management of ingested foreign bodies, Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (Print), 55, 7, pp. 802-806, (2002); Kim MJ, Seo JM, Lee YM, Choe YH., An unusual cause of duodenal perforation due to a lollipop stick, Korean Journal of Pediatrics/Korean Journal of Pediatrics, 56, 4, (2013); Barranco R, Tacchella T, Lo Pinto S, Bonsignore A, Ventura F., An unusual and fatal case of upper gastrointestinal perforation and bleeding secondary to foreign body ingestion, Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine, 41, pp. 72-75, (2016); Kaazan P, Seow W, Tan Z, Et al., Deliberate foreign body ingestion in patients with underlying mental illness: A retrospective multicentre study, Australasian Psychiatry (Print), 31, 5, pp. 619-624, (2023); Kay M, Wyllie R., Pediatric foreign bodies and their management, Current Gastroenterology Reports, 7, 3, pp. 212-218, (2005); Rosenfield D, Strickland M, Fecteau A., Magnet Ingestion by a 3-year-old Boy, 185, pp. 972-973, (2013); Semple T, Calder AD, Ramaswamy M, McHugh K., Button battery ingestion in children-a potentially catastrophic event of which all radiologists must be aware, Br J Radiol, 91, (2018); Rashid MH, Gosai I., The girl who swallows knives: uncontrollable deliberate self-harm in a teenage girl with borderline personality disorder, BMJ Case Reports, 2011, jan20 1, (2011); Frei-Lanter C, Vavricka SR, Kruger T, Et al., Endoscopy for repeatedly ingested sharp foreign bodies in patients with borderline personality disorder, European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, 24, 7, pp. 793-797, (2012); Atluri D, Veluru C, Chopra A, Mullen KD, Recurrent Intentional Foreign Body Ingestion: An Endoscopist’s Dilemma, 8, (2012); Vourliotis C, Ng F, Bruxner G., Fighting for the Last Gasp”Severe borderline personality disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, chronic deliberate ingestion of foreign bodies, and palliative struggles in intensive care, Journal of Psychiatric Practice (Print), 29, 2, pp. 160-166, (2023); Omejc M., Laparoscopic removal of an ingested pin migrating into the liver, Surgical Endoscopy, 16, 3, (2002); Wells RG., Tissue mechanics and fibrosis, Biochimica Et Biophysica Acta (BBA)-Molecular Basis of Disease, 1832, 7, pp. 884-890, (2013); Papazoglou Patsikas, Rallis, Intestinal foreign bodies in dogs and cats, Compendium on Continuing Education for the Practicing Veterinarian-North American Edition, 25, 11, pp. 830-845, (2003); Lim DJ, Kuk JC, Kim TH, Shin EJ., Surgery for intra-abdominal abscess due to intestinal perforation caused by toothpick ingestion, Medicine (Baltimore, Md), 98, 36, (2019)","R.W.J.

We present the case of a patient with an extensive history of FBIs and suicide attempts and a multitude of psychiatric diagnoses including borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder from significant abuse in foster care, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and pica. During the single hospitalization described in this report, she had multiple incidents of self-harm, aggression, and 9 FBIs. A multidisciplinary team involving psychiatry, emergency medicine, gastroenterology, surgery, internal medicine, nursing, social work, behavioral health technicians, case management, chaplain, the legal department, police officers, and hospital maintenance was necessary for care coordination. Interventions included 8 endoscopies and an abdominal surgery to retrieve swallowed foreign bodies, pain management, psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions for agitation, and environmental precautions to minimize the risk of ingestion. Ultimately, to prevent further trauma and limit additional opportunities for FBI, a collaborative decision was made with the patient to discharge her to her home with outpatient psychologist and psychiatrist support. This case describes the complexities of hospital management of a patient with intentional recurrent FBI, highlighting the importance of a critical assessment of risk versus benefit for prolonging hospitalization. Development of practical management protocols and risk assessments for continued hospitalization is necessary for patients with recurrent intentional FBIs. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Carter Memorial Hospital, Indianapolis, IN, United States","Self-injurious behavior (SIB) has for some time been endemic in psychiatrically ill youth (Doctors, 1981). Adolescent SIB commonly occurs during psychiatric inpatient hospitalization and in adolescents who are in group homes, residential treatment centers, and correctional facilities. There are reports of SIB in up to 61% of teen psychiatric inpatients (DiClemente, Ponton, and Hartley, 1991). Alongside self-cutting, self-burning, and other forms of SIB, an even more dangerous behavior has appeared that presents a major challenge in inpatient settings: deliberately swallowing indigestible objects. We first encountered this as a problem in an intermediate-term state hospital in 1992 when an older teen was transferred from an adult unit where she had been admitted on an emergency basis for repeated swallowing of batteries. The behavior is dangerous: endoscopy is sometimes needed to remove the foreign object, and other surgical procedures may be required. Such behavior has been classified as deliberate foreign body ingestion (DFBI). This report begins with a review of the literature on SIB and DFBI and discusses current thinking about the etiology of DFBI and related disorders. We then present our research, a systematic chart review describing 20 seriously ill youngsters who engaged in DFBI while hospitalized. Finally, we share our experience in working with this dangerous and maladaptive behavior. Our goal is to convey an understanding of these youth in the context of psychiatric practice, to enhance the treatment and prevention of DFBI and associated SIB.","","","","","","","","","Barstow D.G., Self-injury and self-mutilation, J.

Self-harm and suicide are associated with particular injuries and patterns of injury. Many of these patterns are apparent on imaging. Self-harm or suicidal intent may be overlooked initially in such cases, particularly when the patient is unconscious or uncooperative. Correct identification of these findings by the radiologist will allow a patient's management to be tailored accordingly and may prevent future suicide attempts. The initial role of the radiologists in these cases is to identify life-threatening injuries that require urgent medical attention. The radiologist can add value by drawing attention to associated injuries, which may have been missed on initial clinical assessment. In many cases of self-harm and suicide, imaging is more reliable than clinical assessment. The radiologist may be able to provide important prognostic information that allows clinicians to manage expectations and plan appropriately. Furthermore, some imaging studies will provide essential forensic information. Unfortunately, many cases of attempted suicide will end in brain death. The radiologist may have a role in these cases in identifying evidence of hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury, confirming a diagnosis of brain death through judicious use of ancillary tests and, finally, in donor screening for organ transplantation. A review is presented to illustrate the imaging features of self-harm, suicide, and brain death, and to highlight the important role of the radiologist in these cases. © 2024 The Royal College of Radiologists","","Brain Death; Firearms; Humans; Radiologists; Risk Factors; Self-Injurious Behavior; Wounds, Gunshot; adult; automutilation; brain death; cause of death; clinical article; clinical assessment; disease association; donor selection; drowning; female; gunshot injury; hanging; human; hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy; jumping; male; organ transplantation; radiologist; Review; self poisoning; suicide; suicide attempt; thorax radiography; unconsciousness; x-ray computed tomography; brain death; diagnostic imaging; firearm; gunshot injury; radiologist; risk factor","","","","","","","Naghavi M., Global, regional, and national burden of suicide mortality 1990 to 2016: systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016, BMJ, 364, (2019); World Health Organization, Preventing suicide: a global imperative, (2014); Corcoran P., Griffin E., Arensman E., Et al., Impact of the economic recession and subsequent austerity on suicide and self-harm in Ireland: an interrupted time series analysis, Int J Epidemiol, 44, pp. 969-977, (2015); Central Statistics Office, Suicide statistics, (2020); Chesney E., Goodwin G.M., Fazel S., Risks of all-cause and suicide mortality in mental disorders: a meta-review, World Psychiatry, 13, pp. 153-160, (2014); Hirschfeld R.M.A., Russell J.M., Assessment and treatment of suicidal patients, N Engl J Med, 337, pp. 910-915, (1997); (2004); Petronis K.R., Samuels J.F., Moscicki E.K., Et al., An epidemiologic investigation of potential risk factors for suicide attempts, Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol, 25, pp. 193-199, (1990); Ajdacic-Gross V., Weiss M.G., Ring M., Et al., Methods of suicide: international suicide patterns derived from the WHO mortality database, Bull World Health Organ, 86, pp. 726-732, (2008); Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5, (2013); Ribeiro J.D., Franklin J.C., Fox K.R., Et al., Self-injurious thoughts and behaviors as risk factors for future suicide ideation, attempts, and death: a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies, Psychol Med, 46, pp. 225-236, (2016); Haukka J., Suominen K., Partonen T., Et al., Determinants and outcomes of serious attempted suicide: a nationwide study in Finland, 1996–2003, Am J Epidemiol, 167, pp. 1155-1163, (2008); DiPoce J., Guelfguat M., DiPoce J., Radiologic findings in cases of attempted suicide and other self-injurious behavior, RadioGraphics, 32, pp. 2005-2024, (2012); Salim A., Martin M., Sangthong B., Et al., Near-hanging injuries: a 10-year experience, Injury, 37, pp. 435-439, (2006); Aufderheide T.P., Aprahamian C., Mateer J.R., Et al., Emergency airway management in hanging victims, Ann Emerg Med, 24, pp. 879-884, (1994); Gascho D., Heimer J., Tappero C., Et al., Relevant findings on postmortem CT and postmortem MRI in hanging, ligature strangulation and manual strangulation and their additional value compared to autopsy—a systematic review, Forensic Sci Med Pathol, 15, pp. 84-92, (2019); Garetier M., Deloire L., Dedouit F., Et al., Postmortem computed tomography findings in suicide victims, Diagn Interv Imaging, 98, pp. 101-112, (2017); Choi D.W., Lee S.W., Jeong S.-H., Et al., Early diffusion-weighted imaging and outcome prediction of comatose survivors after suicidal hanging, Am J Emerg Med, 37, pp. 5-11, (2019); Fukumoto W., Mitani H., Kuno Y., Et al., Incidence and factor analysis of laryngohyoid fractures in hanging individuals-computed tomography study, Eur Radiol, 31, pp. 7827-7833, (2021); Gunnell D., Bennewith O., Hawton K., Et al., The epidemiology and prevention of suicide by hanging: a systematic review, Int J Epidemiol, 34, pp. 433-442, (2005); Choi J.H., Kim S.H., Kim S.P., Et al., Characteristics of intentional fall injuries in the, Am J Emerg Med, 32, pp. 529-534, (2014); Varnik A., Kolves K., van der Feltz-Cornelis C.M., Et al., Suicide methods in Europe: a gender-specific analysis of countries participating in the “European Alliance against Depression.”, J Epidemiol Commun Health, 62, pp. 545-551, (2008); Kua E.H., Tsoi W.F., Suicide in the island of Singapore, Acta Psychiatr Scand, 71, pp. 227-229, (1985); Alizo G., Sciarretta J.D., Gibson S., Et al., Fall from heights: does height really matter?, Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg, 44, pp. 411-416, (2018); Lowenstein S.R., Yaron M., Carrero R., Et al., Vertical trauma: injuries to patients who fall and land on their feet, Ann Emerg Med, 18, pp. 161-165, (1989); Gill J.R., Fatal descent from height in New York City, J Forensic Sci, 46, pp. 1132-1137, (2001); Isbister E.S., Roberts J.A., Autokabalesis: a study of intentional vertical deceleration injuries, Injury, 23, pp. 119-122, (1992); Hahn M.P., Richter D., Ostermann P.A., Et al., [Injury pattern after fall from great height.

It has attracted great interest among mental health professionals over the lastdecades. However, this issue is rarely reported in the literature. A deep exploration of its clinicaland specific psychopathological aspects remains limited.Case report. - We report the case of a 32-year-old female patient, who was sentenced to20 years in prison for homicide against her cousin, the daughter of an uncle who had rapedher when she was 14. This affair was hushed by the patient's family and the patient was sub-mitted to several acts of abuse by her family. Following her incarceration, she repeatedlyingested metallic objects requiring repeated admissions in a department of surgery for endo-scopic extractions or surgical interventions. She impulsively ingested more than 30 times variousmetallic objects such as wire, razor blades, spoons, etc., under the pressure of impulsivenessand massive anxiety. Voluntary metal ingestions, associated with iterative self-mutilation beha-viors, took place within the framework of a borderline personality disorder, the incarcerationand the conditions of imprisonment playing a role in initiating and retaining the behavior.Conclusion. - Through this case report, we examine the specific psychiatric aspects of inten-tional ingestion of metallic objects in order to better understand this behavior. © L'Encéphale, Paris, 2013.","Borderline personality; Ingestion of metallic objects; Prison environment","Adolescent; Adult; Borderline Personality Disorder; Child Abuse; Child Abuse, Sexual; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal; Female; Foreign-Body Migration; Gastrointestinal Tract; Homicide; Humans; Life Change Events; Metals; Pica; Prisoners; Self Mutilation; Social Environment; Social Facilitation; metal; adult; anxiety disorder; Article; borderline state; case report; child abuse; endoscopic surgery; female; general device; homicide; human; impulsiveness; mental disease; prisoner; razor blade; recurrent voluntary ingestion of metallic object; spoon; wire; adolescent; Borderline Personality Disorder; child sexual abuse; Foreign-Body Migration; gastrointestinal endoscopy; gastrointestinal tract; life event; pica; psychology; Self Mutilation; social behavior; social environment","","Metals, ","","","","","Gerson J., Stanley B., Suicidal and self-injurious behavior in per-sonality disorder: Controversies and treatment directions, CurrPsychiatry Rep, 4, pp. 30-38, (2002); David F., Gitlin M.D., Foreign-body ingestion in patients with per-sonality disorders, Psychosomatics, 48, 2, pp. 162-166, (2007); Bisharat M., O'donnell M.E., Gibson N., Et al., Foreign bodyingestion in prisoners-the Belfast experience, Ulster Med J, 77, 2, pp. 110-114, (2008); Karp J.G., Whitman L., Convit A., Intentional ingestion of foreignobjects by male prison inmates, Hosp Community Psychiatry, 42, 5, pp. 533-535, (1991); O'sullivan S.T., Reardon C.M., McGreal G.T., Et al., Deliberateingestion of foreign bodies by institutionalised psychiatric hos-pital patients and prison inmates, Ir J Med Sci, 165, 4, pp. 294-296, (1996); Lewis C., Hsu H.K., Hoover E., Aspiration of foreign bodies in adultswith personality disorders: Impact on diagnosis and recurrence, J Natl Med Assoc, 103, 7, pp. 620-622, (2011); Marquez-Rojas J., Roldan-Banos S., Lopez-Guerra D., Et al., Bezoar after ingestion of metallic foreign bodies, Cir Cir, 79, 5, pp. 464-467, (2011); Te Wildt B.T., Tettenborn C., Schneider U., Et al., Swallowingforeign bodies as an example of impulse control disorder in apatient with intellectual disabilities: A case report, Psychiatry, 7, 9, pp. 34-37, (2010); Poynter B.A., Hunter J.J., Coverdale J.H., Et al., Hard to swallow:A systematic review of deliberate foreign body ingestion, GenHosp Psychiatry, 33, 5, pp. 518-524, (2011); Villalba R., Harrington C.J., Repetitive self-injurious behavior:A neuropsychiatric perspective and review of pharmacologictreatments, Semin Clin Neuropsychiatry, 5, pp. 215-226, (2000); Santa Mina E.E., Gallop R.M., Childhood sexual and physical abuseand adult self-harm and suicidal behavior: A literature review, Can J Psychiatry, 43, pp. 793-800, (1998); Rodriguez Hermosa J.I., Roig Garcia J., Ruiz Feliu B., Et al., Recurrent ingestion of foreign bodies and abdominal self-injury as a form of attempted suicide, Gastroenterol Hepatol, 27, 9, pp. 529-534, (2004); Pillmann F., Ingestion of metals and factitious disorders.
