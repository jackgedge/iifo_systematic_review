\subsection*{Selection Process}

All identified articles were collated and duplicate articles were identified and removed. Remaining articles underwent independent title and abstract screening conducted by the first author (JGE). To ensure consistency, a randomly selected 10\% sample of these articles underwent independent screening by a second author (MS). Any discrepancies identified between these two reviewers were resolved by a third reviewer (GC). Inter-reviewer agreement was calculated using Cohen's Kappa \cite{Machin_2008}. Remaining articles proceeded to full text review, where the same independent screening process was repeated on full text articles.
