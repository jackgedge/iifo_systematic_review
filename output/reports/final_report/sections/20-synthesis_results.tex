\paragraph{Chi-Squared Tests} A full table of grouped chi-squared test results for the case report cohort is available in Table~\ref{tab:grouped_chi2_wide}. 
In the age group subgroup, 41--60 age group was significantly associated with surgery (OR = 0.19, 95\% CI [0.04, 0.78], p = 0.034); 41--60 age group was significantly associated with death (OR = nan, 95\% CI [nan, nan], p = 0.018). In the motivation subgroup, intent to harm motivation was significantly associated with surgery (OR = 5.10, 95\% CI [1.28, 20.33], p = 0.032); other motivation was significantly associated with surgery (OR = 0.15, 95\% CI [0.03, 0.77], p = 0.031). There were no significant associations with outcomes in the gender, object, and population subgroups.
\paragraph{{Multivariate Logistic Regression}} A full table of grouped logistic regression results is available in Table~\ref{{tab:grouped_logistic_wide}}. In the motivation subgroup, intent to harm motivation was significantly associated with surgery (OR = 15.95, 95\% CI [1.32, 192.48], p = 0.029). In the object subgroup, long (\textgreater{}5cm) object ingestion was significantly associated with surgery (OR = 7.66, 95\% CI [1.04, 56.32], p = 0.045); multiple object ingestion was significantly associated with complication (OR = 14.79, 95\% CI [2.08, 105.31], p = 0.007); long (\textgreater{}5cm) object ingestion was significantly associated with complication (OR = 16.50, 95\% CI [1.76, 154.43], p = 0.014). In the population subgroup, detained person was significantly associated with complication (OR = 0.04, 95\% CI [0.00, 0.69], p = 0.028). There were no significant associations with outcomes in the age group, and gender subgroups.
