In This Study, Aspiration Of Screwdriver  And Healing Abutment Is Reported With Literature Review. Materials And Methods: A  26-Year-Old Male Patient Was Referred From A Local Dental Clinic With The  Suspicion Of Ingestion Of A Screwdriver And Healing Abutment During The  Second-Stage Surgery. The Patient Reported Symptoms Including Dyspnea, Cough, And  Foreign Body Sensation. On The Chest Radiograph, A Radiopaque Foreign Body  Resembling The Screwdriver And Healing Abutment Was Observed At The Right Mid  Lung. Results: Bronchoscopic Examination Using Flexible Cable Was Performed Under  Conscious Sedation, And Microforceps Were Used To Remove The Instruments.  Aspirated Screwdriver And Healing Abutment Were Removed Safely Under Intravenous  Sedation. The Patient Did Not Have Any Symptoms Associated With Lung Aspiration  After Removal Of The Foreign Body During Follow-Up Periods. Conclusion:  Bronchoscopic Removal Is The Most Recommended Procedure For Removal Of The  Aspirated Foreign Body. This Can Be Performed Under Conscious Sedation.

Despite Public Awareness Campaigns Its Incidence Is Increasing ...,"Objective: Button battery in digestive tract has unpredictable outcome ranging from harmless to death around the globe. Despite
public awareness campaigns its incidence is increasing with the passage of time. The purpose of this study is to highlight the severe
complications associated with it and to sensitize the community to participate in its prevention to avoid catastrophic outcomes.
Patients and Methods: This study included 47 patients. Protocol includes patient`s age, time of presentation, signs and symptoms
and relevant radiographic investigations. Button batteries were urgently removed under general anesthesia.
Results: The average follow up period is 3 months. Total 47 patients are included in this study. Three patients has BB in stomach and
below, twenty six had BB in cricopharynx and eighteen in hypopharynx. Two patients developed esophageal perforation. One patient
developed aortoesophageal fistula and died.
Conclusion: The mainstay of treatment is the early detection of button batteries. It should be urgently extracted out to avoid lethal
complications. Physician and parental education can significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with its ingestion.
Electronic and print media should be utilized to develop awareness in the community.",False,,True,3.0,Exclude,"Not intentional self-harm (it was an intentional attempt to eat a fish, which I think counts as food?)"

There Are No Data To Evaluate The Prevalence Of This Phenomenon In Poland. In The United States The Annual Death Rate ...,"Foreign body ingestion is a commonly re-
ported clinical problem. There are no data to
evaluate the prevalence of this phenomenon
in Poland. In the United States the annual
death rate due to foreign body ingestion is
estimated at up to 1500-2700 (1). In 80% of
cases foreign body ingestion is unintentional
and reported in children (2). Among adults
unintentional foreign body ingestion is re-
ported most commonly in the elderly and al-
cohol-dependent patients (3). Some literature
indicates that intentional foreign body inges-
tion among adults accounts for only 10% of all
cases (4), there are however studies suggesting
that intentional foreign body ingestion ac-
counts for up to 92% of all cases of foreign body
ingestion (5). Multiple retrospective studies
confirm consistently that intentional foreign
body ingestions are most commonly reported
in patients with psychiatric disorders, mental
impairment and in prison inmates (4-7).
Considering all cases together, the major-
ity of foreign bodies pass spontaneously,
10-20% require endoscopic intervention and
only 1% are removed surgically (3). Inten-
tional foreign body ingestion is associated
with much more severe consequences, which
require emergency medical intervention in up
to 76% of patients and surgery in 28% of pa-
tients (8).
Foreign body ingestion management de-
pends on the characteristics of the ingested
foreign body, such as: size, shape, presence of
sharp edges, its location, time from ingestion,
severity of clinical symptoms and development
of potential complications (5). on the other
hand the material the foreign body is made of
determines the usefulness of diagnostic tech-
niques (9, 10).
This literature review presents the extent
of intentional foreign body ingestion with re-
gard to risk group characteristics, usefulness
of imaging diagnostics, management options
and prevention of recurrence.",False,,True,3.0,Exclude,Not intentional

Therefore,  Studies May Not Draw Generalizable Conclusions. Furthermore, Data Regarding Fbis  Management In Europe Are Limited And Outdated. This Study Aimed To Analyze The  Endoscopic Management And Outcomes Of Fbis In An Italian Tertiary Care Hospital  To Identify Risk Factors For Endoscopic Failure. Methods: We Retrospectively  Reviewed Patients Who Underwent Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy For Fbis Between  2007 And 2017. Baseline, Clinical, Fbis, And Endoscopic Characteristics And  Outcomes Were Collected And Reported Using Descriptive Statistics And Logistic  Regression Analyses. Results: Of The 381 Endoscopies For Fbis, 288 (75.5%) Were  Emergent Endoscopy And 135 (35,4%) Included Underlying Upper Gastrointestinal  Conditions. The Study Population Included 44 Pediatric Patients (11.5%), 54  Prisoners (15.8%), And 283 Adults (74.2%). The Most Common Type And Location Of  Fbis Were Food Boluses (52.9%) And Upper Esophagus (36.5%), Respectively. While  Eight Patients (2.1%) Developed Major Adverse Events Requiring Hospital  Admission, The Remainder (97.9%) Were Discharged After Observation. No Mortality  Occurred. Endoscopic Success Was Achieved In 263 Of 286 (91.9%) Verified Fbis  Endoscopies. Endoscopic Failure (8.04%) Was Associated With Age, Bone, Disk  Battery, Intentional Ingestion, Razor Blade, Prisoners, And Stomach In The  Univariate Analysis. Multivariate Logistic Regression Revealed That Intentional  Ingestion Was Associated With Endoscopic Failure (Odds Ratio: 7.31; 95%  Confidence Interval = 2.06-25.99; P  = 0.002). Conclusion: Endoscopy For Fbis Is  Safe And Successful, With Low Hospital Admission Rate In Children, Prisoners, And  Adults.

Methods: The Esophageal Structure And  Function Of 8 Patients Treated For Afbi Requiring Endoscopic Removal Of  Alimentary Foreign Bodies In 6 Of Them (Up To 4 Times In 1 Case) Were  Investigated By Barium Meal, Esophagoscopy-Biopsy, Ph-Metering, Pull-Through  Stationary Manometry, And 24-Hour Ambulatory Manometry. The Results Were Compared  With Those In A Group Of Age-Matched Regular Refluxers (N = 14) Without Afbi.  Results: Six Boys And 2 Girls Aged 108 +/- 59 Months Had Impaction. Six Children  Had Symptoms Of Ger Like Vomiting During Infancy, Heartburn, Or Respiratory Tract  Disease. Barium Swallow Ruled Out Stenosis In All Patients And Showed Small  Hiatal Hernias In 3. All Had Endoscopic And Histologic Esophagitis (Moderate To  Severe In 6), And One Had Schatzki Ring. All But One (Who Had 8.45 Mm Hg) Had  Normal Lower Esophageal Sphincter Pressure (16.2 +/- 4.7 Mm Hg, Mean +/- Sd), And  All Showed Normal Sphincteric Relaxation. Esophageal Body Motility Was Not  Significantly Different From That In Regular Refluxers Except In 6 Children In  Whom Energetic Distal Peristalsis After Reflux Episodes Could Be Seen  Particularly During The Night. Three Of Them Had Amazingly Powerful Distal Waves  During The Day And Even Stronger, Simultaneous, Wide And Bizarre-Shaped Waves  During Sleep. Symptoms Improved In All Cases After Antireflux Medication. Four  Patients Were Cured After Antireflux Surgery. Conclusions: Afbi Is A Dramatic But  Practically Unheard Of Symptom Of Ger In Children. It Should Be Differentiated  From Dysphagia And Reveals Motor Dysfunction, Sometimes Severe, Of The Esophageal  Body In The Absence Of Sphincteric Obstruction.

In This Case Study, We Report A Case Of Lanthanum Ingestion Resulting In Imaging Consistent With Ingested  Metallic Foreign Bodies. Summary: Hyperphosphatemia Affects Most Patients With  End-Stage Renal Disease (Esrd) And Is Associated With Morbidity And Mortality.  Lanthanum Carbonate Reduces Daily Phosphate Absorption And Is Indicated As A  Non-Calcium-Based Phosphate Binder In Patients With Esrd. A 58-Year-Old Man With  A Medical History Of Stage 5 Chronic Kidney Disease Was Admitted To The Intensive  Care Unit (Icu) For Hyperkalemia And Acute Respiratory Failure After A Missed  Dialysis Session. He Required Vasopressors, Intubation, And Continuous Renal  Replacement Therapy. Admission Imaging Demonstrated Several Ingested Metallic  Foreign Bodies Within The Colon. There Was Consideration Of Colorectal Surgery  And Gastroenterology Consultation. On The Initial Medication Reconciliation, No  Medications That Would Have The Radiographic Appearance Of Ingested Metallic  Foreign Bodies Were Identified. On Further Review Of Prescription Data Available  Through The Electronic Medical Record, It Was Noted That The Patient Had Recently  Filled A Prescription For Lanthanum Despite Its Apparent Discontinuation On A  Previous Admission. After Interviewing The Patient'S Wife, It Was Confirmed That  The Patient Had Continued Taking Lanthanum And That He Was Swallowing It Whole  And Not Chewing It. No Consultations Or Interventions Were Performed, And The  Metallic Foreign Bodies Were No Longer Present On Further Imaging After A Period  Of 35 Days. Conclusion: Escalation Of Care Was Avoided In This Patient Due To The  Performance Of Diligent Medication Reconciliation And Recognition Of The Impact  Of Lanthanum Ingestion On Imaging.",,True,2.0,False,,Unclear,Could well include intentional foreign object ingestion

Therefore, It Is Important That Radiologists Be Aware Of This Commonly Encountered Entity. Attempted Suicide May Take A Variety Of Forms; Those Discussed By The Authors Include Sharp Force Injury, Immolation And Inhalation, Ingestion, Hanging, Firearm Use, Jumping From A Height, And Drowning. Certain Radiologic Findings Are Commonly Seen In Cases Of Attempted Suicide And Other Self-Injurious Behaviors. In Some Cases, Especially When The Patient Is Unconscious Or Is Unwilling To Provide A History, It May Not Be Apparent That Suicide Has Been Attempted Until Characteristic Imaging Findings Are Recognized. Correct Identification Of Suicide Attempts On The Basis Of Such Findings Will Ensure That These Patients Receive Appropriate Psychiatric Treatment. When A Suicide Attempt Is Unsuccessful, It Is Important To Be Familiar With The Complications That May Contribute To Delayed Mortality And Morbidity. The Radiologist Plays An Integral Role In The Acute Medical Or Surgical Management Of Patients Who Have Attempted Suicide. In Addition, Imaging Examinations May Provide Useful Forensic Information.

It Is Induced By Internal Redistribution, Decreased Intestinal Absorption, Or Urinary Wasting. We Present A Case Of Multifactorial Severe Hypophosphatemia In The Setting Of Chronic Alcoholism And Presumed Refeeding Syndrome. Case Description: A 69 Year Old Male With A History Of Alcohol Use Disorder Presented To The Ed With Generalized Muscle Weakness, Recurrent Falls And Confusion. He Reported Consuming 2 Bottles Of Wine Daily For Several Years, With His Last Drink 24 Hours Prior To Presentation. He Reported A History Of Caloric Restriction With Intentional Weight Loss Followed By A Recent Increase In Caloric Intake In The Preceding Week. His Initial Presentation Was Consistent With Sepsis From Contained Sigmoid Perforation Due To Foreign Body Ingestion, Likely A Chicken Bone. Labs Revealed Phosphorus < 1, Potassium 2.0, Magnesium 1.4, Lactate 8.5, Wbc 6.1 With 34% Band Neutrophils, Mild Alkalosis (Venous Ph 7.43), Pco(2) 42, Hco(3) 24. He Was Admitted To The Icu And Received Volume Resuscitation, Iv Antibiotics, Management Of Alcohol Withdrawal, Intravenous Phosphate, Potassium And Magnesium. Repeat Labs Showed Improved Phosphorus To 1.9, However Serum Corrected Calcium Decreased From 9.5 To 7.5 Mg/Dl. He Continued To Receive Further Repletion Of Electrolytes With Eventual Normalization. Discussion: The Etiology Of This Patient'S Severe Hypophosphatemia Was Multifactorial From Chronic Alcoholism And Refeeding Syndrome. Refeeding Syndrome Was Likely Present In This Case Given The Patient'S Malnutrition And Weight Loss With Recent Significantly Increased Caloric Intake Resulting In Severe Hypophosphatemia, Hypokalemia And Hypomagnesemia. His Generalized Muscle Weakness Can Be Explained By Alcoholism And Severe Electrolyte Derangements. Fortunately, He Did Not Develop Respiratory Failure Which Is A Complication Of Severe Hypophosphatemia As A Result Of Decreased Intracellular Atp. For Patients With Severe Hypophosphatemia (< 1 Mg/Dl), Iv Phosphate Repletion Is Recommended With Level Monitoring Every Six Hours.
