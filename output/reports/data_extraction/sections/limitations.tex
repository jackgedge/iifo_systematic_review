\section{Limitations}
Did not examine rates of true ingestion in larger studies. 
Did not examine item location. 
Did not examine time to intervention.
Did not examine repeated ingestions during admission, unless seperated into a different case. 
Did not examine rates of underlying gastrointestinal pathology. failed endoscopic retrieval should be considered as a marker for potential underlying gastrointestinal pathology and a requirement for operative intervention \cite{ODonnell_2008}.
