\subsubsection*{Case Reports}
A full table of grouped chi-squared test results for the case report cohort is available in Table~\ref{tab:grouped_chi2_wide}. 
In the gender subgroup, there were no significant associations between gender and outcomes. In the age group subgroup, 41--60 was significantly associated with Surgery (OR = 0.19, 95\% CI [0.04, 0.78], p = 0.034). 41--60 was significantly associated with Death (OR = N/A, 95\% CI [N/A, N/A], p = 0.018). All other comparisons in this subgroup were non-significant. In the population characteristics subgroup, there were no significant associations between population characteristics and outcomes. In the motivation subgroup, Intent To Harm was significantly associated with Surgery (OR = 5.10, 95\% CI [1.28, 20.33], p = 0.032). Other was significantly associated with Surgery (OR = 0.15, 95\% CI [0.03, 0.77], p = 0.031). All other comparisons in this subgroup were non-significant. In the object characteristics subgroup, there were no significant associations between object characteristics and outcomes.
