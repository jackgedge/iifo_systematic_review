\subsection{Subgroup Data}

From Table~\ref{tab:population_summary}, we observe that 39.7\% of the population had a psychiatric history, 20.7\% were prisoners, and 19.0\% had a history of previous ingestions. Smaller proportions were psychiatric inpatients (6.9\%), had a history of severe disability (5.2\%), were displaced persons (3.4\%), or were under the influence of alcohol (3.4\%) at the time of presentation.

From Table~\ref{tab:motivation_summary}, the most frequently recorded motivations were unknown (34.5\%), intent to harm (32.8\%), and psychiatric reasons (31.0\%). Psychosocial motivations accounted for 20.7\% of cases, followed by protest-related ingestion (13.8\%), and motivations classified as 'other' (12.1\%). Additional subcategories included 'Other Psych Hx' (6.9\%).

From Table~\ref{tab:object_summary}, the most commonly ingested object types were long objects (44.8\%), sharp objects (41.4\%), and multiple objects (39.7\%). Less frequently, ingestions involved long sharp objects (17.2\%), magnets (5.2\%), while no cases involved button batteries (0.0\%).

From Table~\ref{tab:outcome_summary}, surgical intervention was the most common outcome (72.4\%), followed by injuries requiring intervention (53.4\%) and perforation (36.2\%). Endoscopy was performed in 26.3\% of cases. Other outcomes included miscellaneous findings (22.4\%), conservative management (10.3\%), death (8.6\%), and obstruction (8.6\%).

From Table~\ref{tab:top-correlations}, Psychiatric History showed a strong positive correlation with Psychiatric Motivation ($r = 0.83$), as expected. Injury requiring intervention was strongly associated with perforation ($r = 0.70$), consistent with it being the most common complication. Being a prisoner was also notably associated with protest-related motivation ($r = 0.54$). Surgical intervention correlated positively with both injury needing intervention ($r = 0.51$) and perforation ($r = 0.47$), while showing a negative correlation with conservative management ($r = -0.55$) and psychiatric motivation ($r = -0.42$). Endoscopy was negatively correlated with both perforation ($r = -0.37$) and sharp object ingestion ($r = -0.43$). Conservative management showed a negative correlation with injury needing intervention ($r = -0.36$), and a positive correlation with previous ingestions ($r = 0.41$). Additionally, psychiatric motivation was positively correlated with multiple object ingestion ($r = 0.37$).
