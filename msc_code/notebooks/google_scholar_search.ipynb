    "# Google Scholar Search\n",

    "**Date:** 8th January 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Google Scholar is popular tool for searching grey literature. Unlike databases like PubMed and Embase which are curated, maintained by humans and contain only published literature. Google Scholar, on the other hand, searches the internet for what it believes are academic materials and then displays them in a list. As a result, Google Scholar is excellent for seaching grey literature, as results will include unpublished data such as thesises and other useful material, reducing publication bias and susceptability bias (Haddaway et al., 2015)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, because Google Scholar references the internet in this way and is not itself a database, this can make querying cumbersome and the number of results returned by queries and be overwhelming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following the failure of my experiments with Scholarly, I opted to use SerpAPI to query Google Scholar and clean and manipulate the results to add to my systematic review database/literature search. SerpAPI has a free-tier up to 100 Google Scholar requests per month, so I utilise my free trial and give it a go.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document details my search queries and how I've tailored them to gather an appropriate number of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important\n",
    "The result limit in my query function is set to 300. This is because some research exists to researches should focus on the first 200-300 results, with useful resources being found after the 80 result mark (Haddaway et al., 2015)."
