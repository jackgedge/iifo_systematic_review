\subsection*{Assessment of Reporting Bias}

Risk of bias due to missing results (arising from reporting biases) was not formally assessed through funnel plot inspection or quantitative methods such as Egger’s test, as the number of included case series per outcome was too small to support these analyses (fewer than 10 series per outcome). Furthermore, case series are prone to selective reporting and variable outcome definitions, which may contribute to reporting bias; however, the heterogeneity in reporting precluded a more formal assessment.

For the meta-regressions, the inclusion of aggregate case report data partially mitigated the risk of missing results at the series level but could not address potential reporting biases within the individual case reports or across studies. Overall, the potential for reporting bias remains a limitation of the syntheses presented in this review and should be considered when interpreting results.
