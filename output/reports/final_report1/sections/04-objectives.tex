\subsection*{Objectives}
The primary object of this systematic review was to quantify the rates of endoscopy, surgery, death, complication and conservative management following intentional ingestion of foreign objects in human populations. The review sought to examine how individual factors such as demographic/population characteristics, object characteristics and motivations for ingestion influence the likelihood of these outcomes.
