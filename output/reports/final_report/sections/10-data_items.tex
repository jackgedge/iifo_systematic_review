\subsection*{Data Items}
Data were extracted for a range of outcomes, including rates of endoscopic and surgical intervention, conservative management, mortality, and ingestion-related complications such as perforation or obstruction. Where reported, other outcomes including injuries requiring intervention or additional medical consequences were also recorded.

Additional variables included demographic characteristics (e.g. psychiatric history, prisoner or displacement status), motivational factors (e.g. intent to self-harm, protest, psychiatric or psychosocial drivers), and object features (e.g. length, sharpness, presence of magnets or batteries, and quantity ingested). Full definitions of all variables are provided in Appendix~\ref{appendix:variables}.

The full dataset of extracted case-level and study-level data (including bias assesments), is available as Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 (provided as separate files).
