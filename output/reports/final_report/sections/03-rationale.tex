\section*{Rationale}
Deliberate foreign body ingestion (DFBI) is defined as non-accidental ingestion of a true foreign body (non-nutritive items) for parasuicidal reasons \cite{Becq_2021}.

In 1635, Daniel Schwaban performed a gastrotomy on a man who had swallowed a knife \cite{Moehlau_1895}. In 1738, Gorsauld is credited as the first surgeon to perform a cervical esophagotomy for the removal of a foreign body (FB) \cite{Saint_1929}. In 1906, José Goyanes extracted a coin impacted in the esophagus using a rigid esophagoscope \cite{Barros_1991}. The early 20\textsuperscript{th} century saw the emergence of rigid esophagoscopy as the first large-scale method for foreign body extraction, with further case series detailing technical refinements appearing in the literature \cite{Lerche_1911, Jackson_1957}.

Among the most extraordinary documented cases is that by Chalk, who reported a psychiatric patient ingesting 2,533 objects weighing a total of 21,268 grams \cite{Chalk_1928}. The largest single ingested item reported measured 28 cm in length \cite{Ricote_1985}.

Psychiatric conditions most frequently associated with intentional ingestion of foreign objects (IIFO) include psychosis, malingering, pica, and personality disorders \cite{Poynter_2011, Gitlin_2007}. The term “pica” originates from the Latin word for “magpie,” reflecting the bird’s tendency to collect unusual items \cite{Kaplan_2009}, and has been reported globally \cite{McLoughlin_1987}.

Malingering can present in various forms, particularly in prison populations where manipulation to trigger medical transfer is a noted motivation \cite{Poynter_2011, Gitlin_2007, Losanoff_1997e}. In such cases, the optimal management often involves brief medical intervention with minimal reinforcement, followed by prompt return to custody \cite{Blaho_1998}. In contrast, individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may describe escalating anxiety prior to ingestion followed by a sense of relief afterward \cite{Poynter_2011}.

In cases involving borderline personality disorder, Gitlin et al. \cite{Gitlin_2007} suggest that IIFO may function as an affect regulation strategy, particularly during episodes of perceived abandonment. While such behaviour may appear life-threatening, it should not be presumed to indicate suicidal intent \cite{Poynter_2011}.

A wide range of psychiatric diagnoses have been associated with recurrent foreign body ingestion, including pica, personality disorder, impulse control disorder, OCD, autism spectrum disorder, factitious disorder (including Munchausen syndrome), intellectual disability, psychosis, and malingering \cite{Guinan_2019f, Gitlin_2007}. In rare and severe cases, some authors have proposed a palliative care approach to repeated IIFO, recognising the limited prognosis associated with treatment-resistant psychiatric illness and the cumulative harms of repeated surgical intervention \cite{Jaini_2023}.

Motivations for IIFO can include relief from psychological symptoms, self-punishment, attempts to influence others, or command hallucinations \cite{Tromans_2019}. Notably, ingestion alone should not be assumed to indicate suicidal intent \cite{Poynter_2011}.

Clinical outcomes are influenced by various factors, including patient age, comorbidities, object characteristics (size, shape, composition, anatomical location), and the time elapsed since ingestion \cite{Ikenberry_2011}. In a seminal study of incarcerated individuals, Karp et al. \cite{Karp_1991} found that motivations for ingestion included suicidal ideation with and without command hallucinations, self-harm without suicidal intent, and manipulation of the medicolegal system.

In correctional populations, multivariate analysis has shown that the number of ingested items significantly increases the likelihood of hospital admission, endoscopy, and surgery. Endoscopic intervention, in turn, significantly reduces the odds of requiring surgical management \cite{Dalal_2013}.

A recent report from a UK acute NHS trust identified a rise in IIFO cases during the COVID-19 pandemic \cite{Jones_2023d}. While motivation remains a complex and poorly understood element of this phenomenon, tools such as the SIMS-II Motivation Scale may provide standardised frameworks for future analysis \cite{Morales_2014}.

More broadly, the global displacement crisis has reached unprecedented levels, with over 100 million forcibly displaced individuals reported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as of May 2024 \cite{UNHCR_2022}. Refugees and asylum seekers often endure extreme hardships, compelling them to seek asylum in foreign countries \cite{UNHCR_2010, AmnestyInternational_2024}. This vulnerable population frequently faces compounded mental health challenges due to traumatic pre-migration experiences, hazardous journeys, and difficult post-migration realities, including detention and instability of legal status \cite{Athwal_2015, Sundvall_2015, Nickerson_2019, Bevione_2024}.

Self-harm, encompassing various behaviours where individuals inflict harm on themselves, is a particularly alarming manifestation of these mental health challenges. Rates of self-harm are significantly elevated among asylum seekers and refugees compared to general populations, especially among those who are detained, with rates up to 216 times higher in offshore detention facilities than in the general population \cite{vonWerthern_2018, Hedrick_2019, GlobalDetentionProject_2024}.

Methods of suicide and self-harm among refugees differ based on available means, cultural factors, and motivating factors \cite{Ajdacic-Gross_2008}. Common methods include cutting, self-battery, attempted hanging, self-poisoning by medication or chemicals, and ingestion of foreign objects \cite{Hedrick_2019}.

Globally, rates of foreign object ingestion are increasing. In the United States, rates doubled in 2017, with 14% of cases deemed intentional \cite{Hsieh_2020}. A 2009 review found intentional ingestions in up to 92% of adults from lower socioeconomic populations, suggesting that rates may be even higher among refugees and asylum seekers \cite{Palta_2009}.

Most ingested foreign bodies (80--90%) pass spontaneously, but 10--20% require endoscopic removal and up to 1% need surgery. Timely assessment and intervention are critical \cite{Ikenberry_2011, Birk_2016}. In refugee contexts, however, geographic isolation and limited access to advanced care complicate timely management, potentially increasing morbidity and mortality \cite{Vujkovic_2019}.

Despite the rising prevalence and potential severity of IIFO, there is limited research exploring how motivations for ingestion differ across vulnerable groups and how these motivations may influence clinical outcomes \cite{Bhugra_2010, Haase_2022, Hedrick_2023a}. Literature to date largely focuses on IIFO in prisons or psychiatric contexts, with sparse data from displaced or asylum-seeking populations. In detention, where traditional communication channels are obstructed, ingestion may serve as a form of protest or distress signal \cite{Puggioni_2014}. Conversely, in psychiatric settings, ingestion may reflect mental illness or affective dysregulation \cite{Gitlin_2007, Tromans_2019, Al-Faham_2020b, Pantazopoulos_2022, Aitchison_2024}.

These varying motivations likely influence clinical management, including decisions around the need for endoscopic or surgical intervention. For instance, if ingestion is primarily intended as protest, patients may avoid behaviours that risk severe harm, potentially lowering the threshold for conservative management.

This systematic review aims to address these gaps by evaluating how motivation for IIFO influences clinical outcomes in vulnerable populations. Specifically, we aim to examine how different motivations impact the need for endoscopic and surgical interventions, thereby informing future clinical strategies and healthcare responses.
