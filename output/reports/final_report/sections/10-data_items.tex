\subsection*{Data Items}
Outcome data were extracted for rates of endoscopy, surgery, conservative management, mortality, and complications. For the purposes of this study, \textit{surgery} was defined as \enquote{any operative intervention performed in a sterile operating theatre under general or regional anaesthesia, involving incision or surgical access to body cavities (including laparotomy, laparoscopy, thoracotomy, or cervical exploration) for the purpose of removing an ingested object or managing complications of ingestion}. Procedures performed \enquote{solely via flexible or rigid endoscopy through natural orifices} were categorised as \textit{endoscopy} and not considered surgical interventions.

Predictor variables were grouped in five subgroups: \textit{Age Group}, \textit{Gender}, \textit{Demographic}, \textit{Motivation}, \textit{Object}. Full definitions of all variables are provided in Appendix~\ref{appendix:variables}.
