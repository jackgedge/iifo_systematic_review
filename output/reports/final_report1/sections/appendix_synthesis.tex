\subsection*{Univariate Association Testing}
A full table of case-level univariate association testing results for is available in Table~\ref{tab:univariate_results}.

In the \textit{Age Group} subgroup, being between 41 and 60 years of age was significantly associated with reduced odds of undergoing surgery (OR = 0.18, 95\% CI [0.04, 0.76], \emph{p} = 0.019). Subgroup analysis (\emph{n} = 61 vs (\emph{n} = 11)) revealed several distinguishing characteristics. Notably, there was a significant increase in the proportion of male patients (82\% vs 56\%, \emph{p} = 0.020), and a higher likelihood of ingesting multiple objects (32\% vs 24\%, \emph{p} = 0.002). Psychiatric motivation and previous ingestion were more common in this subgroup, though not statistically significant. There were also numerical trends toward higher rates of psychiatric inpatient status and psychiatric history, though these did not reach statistical significance. Fewer cases involved sharp or large-diameter objects, and no individuals in this group were detained, but these differences were also non-significant. 

\textit{Intent to harm} motivation was significantly associated with increased odds of undergoing surgery (OR = 5.40, 95\% CI [1.36, 21.43], \emph{p} = 0.024), while another documented motivation was associated with decreased odds (OR = 0.14, 95\% CI [0.03, 0.75], \emph{p} = 0.023). Subgroup analysis (\emph{n} = 21 vs \emph{n} = 51) revealed higher proportions of large-diameter object ingestions (34\%), sharp object ingestions (23\%), and male patients (71\%). Psychosocial motivation was markedly underrepresented (3\%) compared to the broader population. 

\textit{Other} motivation was significantly associated with reduced odds of undergoing surgery (OR = 0.14, 95\% CI [0.03, 0.75], \emph{p} = 0.023). Among cases in this \enquote{other} motivation subgroup (\emph{n} = 9 vs \emph{n} = 63), there were significantly fewer instances of \textit{intent to harm}, \textit{protest}, or \textit{psychosocial} motivations—each underrepresented by approximately 20\%. This group included a higher proportion of female patients (44\%) and individuals with a history of prior ingestion (31\%), as well as a greater presence of severe disability (15\%).

Sharp object ingestion was significantly associated with reduced odds of undergoing endoscopy (OR = 0.34, 95\% CI [0.13, 0.90], \emph{p} = 0.048). Subgroup analysis (\emph{n} = 34 vs \emph{n} = 38) revealed markedly lower proportions of cases involving large-diameter objects and magnets—both typically considered more suitable for endoscopic retrieval. There was also a lower proportion of female patients, and a 15\% lower incidence of severe disability. 

No other significant associations were identified among demographic or gender characteristics. This subgroup comparison is visualised in Figure~\ref{fig:nested_subgroup_plots}.

\subsection*{Logistic Regression}
Grouped univariate linear regression results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:univariate_logistic_regression}.

In univariate logistic regression, being the 18--25 years age group was significantly associated with reduced odds of undergoing endoscopy (OR = 0.29, 95\% CI [0.08, 0.98], \emph{p} = 0.046). Subgroup analysis (\emph{n} = 18 vs \emph{n} = 54) revealed that several factors were over represented in this group; male gender, detained, sharp object ingestion and surgery; and several were significantly over represented: psychiatric history (31\% vs 46\%, \emph{p} < 0.001), psychiatric motivation (23\% vs 44\%, \emph{p} < 0.001), previous ingestions (13\% vs 25\%, \emph{p} < 0.001), and magnetic object ingestion (0\% vs 7\%, \emph{p} = 0.003). The proportion of female patients was also lower (28\% vs 43\%, \emph{p} = 0.004). 

The 41--60 years was significantly associated with reduced odds of undergoing surgery (aOR = 0.18, 95\% CI [0.04, 0.76], \emph{p} = 0.020). Subgroup analysis (\emph{n} = 11) vs \emph{n} = 61) revealed the subgroup had higher rates of males (81\% vs 55\%), psychiatric motivation (50\% vs 36\%), previous ingestions (31\% vs 21\%), and long-object ingestion (19\% vs 18\%), endoscopy (35\% vs 21\%, all \emph{p} < 0.001). 

In contrast, they were significantly less likely to be female (18\% vs 42\%), have \textit{intent to harm} motivation (14\% vs 25\%), be prisoners (0\% vs 17\%), or report \textit{protest} motivation (7\% vs 11\%). Magnet ingestion was also lower in this group (3\% vs 6\%, \emph{p} = 0.045).
Intent to harm was significantly associated with increased odds of undergoing surgery (OR = 5.77, 95\% CI [1.51, 22.03], p = 0.010). The same subgroup analysis undertaken on the unvariate association tests analysis (\emph{n} = 21 vs \emph{n} = 51) revealed higher proportions of large-diameter object ingestions (34\%), sharp object ingestions (23\%), and male patients (71\%). There were fewer females (24\% vs 45\%), less psychiatric motivation (17\% vs 51\%), less psychosocial motivation (3\% vs 29\%), fewer individuals with severe disability history (0\% vs 12\%), and fewer people with previous ingestions (20\% vs 24\%) in the harm group compared to the no-harm group.

In the object subgroup, sharp object ingestion was significantly associated with reduced odds of undergoing endoscopy (OR = 0.34, 95\% CI [0.13, 0.90], \emph{p} = 0.029).

To further explore this finding, we descriptively compared individuals who ingested sharp objects (\emph{n} = 34) with those who did not (\emph{n} = 38). Magnet ingestion was more common in the non-sharp group (12.5\% vs 0\%). The sharp object group also had a higher proportion of males (71\% vs 50\%) and more individuals with psychiatric motivation (46\% vs 30\%). Previous ingestions and prisoner status were more frequently documented among those with sharp object ingestion. Other variables such as female gender, psychosocial motivation, and severe disability history were less common in the sharp object group.

Subgroup comparison is presented visually in Figure~\ref{fig:nested_univariate_logistic_regression_subgroup_plots} in Appendix~\ref{appendix:logistic_regression}.
