      \field{abstract}{The Institute of Race Relations has over the last twenty-three years been monitoring the 508 deaths in custody in suspicious circumstances of individuals from BME, migrant and refugee communities, which rarely make the headlines and for which no person is ever convicted (to be published as the report Dying for Justice). Here, in an extract, the author examines the culture of racism and the impact of privatisation and sub-contracting in the detention and deportation of `failed' asylum seekers. In case after case it exposes how the vulnerable, mentally- and physically-ill are neglected -- leading to deaths by self-harm and inadequate treatment. The death during deportation of Joy Gardner, which involved disproportionate and reckless use of force, is examined in depth. The use of equipment of control for those who are clearly fearful of being forcibly returned, remains a vexed issue.}

      \field{abstract}{Background: Even though asylum seekers are considered vulnerable to mental ill-health, knowledge of their suicidal behaviour is limited. The aim of this study was to improve our understanding of factors that influence the clinical assessment of asylum seekers who have attempted suicide compared to the assessment of non-asylum seekers. Methods: The study focused on 88 asylum seekers registered for suicide attempts in mental health services 2005--2009, who were matched for age and gender and compared with 88 suicide attempters with Swedish personal identity numbers. The medical records were analysed with a quantitative protocol, focusing on social risk and protective factors, health history, current clinical picture as well as the assessment procedure, diagnostics, patterns of treatment and follow-up in this clinical group. Data was analysed using the chi-square test, Fisher's exact probability test, and the Mann--Whitney U test. Results: As in earlier studies, asylum seekers were more traumatized, had different social risk factors and received different diagnoses than the controls. Asylum seekers were referred to less specialized follow-up after treatment, in spite of their health history and of previous and current clinical pictures indicating a similar or - in the case of the female asylum seekers - more serious mental health condition. Female asylum seekers also received more intense and prolonged in-patient treatment than female controls. Asylum seekers appeared to have social networks more often than the control group. However, there was less documentation of the social context, previous suicidal behaviour, and on suicide in the family and close environment of the asylum-seeking men. Information on suicidal intent was lacking in a majority of both groups. The time relation of the suicide attempt and the asylum process suggested the importance of the asylum decision, as well as the possible role of earlier mental health problems and premigration stress, for the suicidal behaviour. Conclusions: The groups had different sets of risk factors and clinical pictures. There was a lack of early and thorough exploration of suicide intent for both groups, and of contextual and subjective factors for the asylum seekers. Differences in follow-up indicate unequal access to care.}

      \field{abstract}{Background Despite the exposure to a wide combination of risk factors, evidence concerning risk of suicide among refugees is mixed. Aims We aimed to establish more precise estimates of suicide and suicidal behavior in refugees and asylum seekers, investigate the role of somatic and psychiatric comorbidities, and the effectiveness of preventative interventions. Methods We searched PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycInfo without time limitations from inception until June 5, 2024. Studies were included if systematic reviews or meta-analyses reporting data on suicide or suicidal behavior in refugees or asylum seekers, or detailing the results of preventive interventions. Quality was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Results Out of 49 papers, 10 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included. Refugees showed significantly higher suicide death rates and suicidal ideation, suicide plan and suicide attempt prevalence compared to people living in the host countries. Refugees who arrived in low-income and lower-middle-income countries displayed lower suicidal ideation, but higher suicide death rates and suicide attempt prevalence compared to refugees who arrived in high-income and upper-middle-income countries. However, no review provided data regarding somatic comorbidity, psychiatric comorbidity, or the effectiveness of treatments, and evidence on specific categories of refugees is scarce. Conclusion Refugees have been proven to be at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. More research is required to identify the targets and procedures of intervention.}

      \field{abstract}{The number of asylum seekers, refugees and internally displaced people worldwide has increased dramatically over the past 5 years. Many countries are continuing to resort to detaining asylum seekers and other migrants, despite concerns that this may be harmful. In light of the considerable body of recent research, this review aims to update and expand on a 2009 systematic review on the mental health consequences of detention on adult, adolescent and child immigration detainees, which found (on the basis on 9 studies) that there was consistent evidence that immigration detention had adverse effects on mental health.}

      \field{abstract}{Background: Systematic research into self-harm in the Australian asylum seeker population is scarce, largely due to the lack of accessible data. The aim of this study was to examine the incidence and characteristics of self-harm across the Australian asylum seeker population, and to ascertain whether self-harm rates and characteristics vary by processing arrangements (i.e. community-based arrangements, community detention, onshore detention, offshore detention (Nauru), and offshore detention (Manus Island)), and gender. Methods: Data relating to the incidence of self-harm, method(s) used to self-harm, processing arrangements, and gender were extracted from all self-harm incidents recorded as occurring among the Australian asylum seeker population between 1st August 2014 and 31st July 2015. Self-harm episode rates were calculated using the average estimated adult population figures for the 12-month period for each asylum seeker population. Results: 949 self-harm episodes were included in the analyses. Rates ranged from 5 per 1000 asylum seekers in community-based arrangements to 260 per 1000 asylum seekers in offshore detention in Nauru. Rates were highest among asylum seekers in offshore and onshore detention facilities, and lowest among asylum seekers in community-based arrangements and community detention. The most common methods of self-harm were cutting (37\%), self-battery (26\%), and attempted hanging (11\%), with asylum seekers in held detention using a wider variety of methods than those in community-based arrangements and community detention. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the exceptionally high rates of self-harm among detained asylum seekers compared to rates observed in the general Australian population, and among asylum seekers in communitybased settings. These findings point clearly to the deleterious impact of immigration detention, and warrant urgent attention.}

      \field{abstract}{The UK has proposed numerous controversial migration enforcement policies aimed at deterring asylum seekers and stopping unauthorised Channel crossings, including mandatory detention and deportation schemes that would send people to ``safe third countries'' like Rwanda. Tens of thousands of people are detained every year in the country's privatised ``immigration removal centres,'' where they can remain indefinitely as the UK has not adopted limits on the length of migration-related detention.}

      \field{abstract}{Foreign body ingestion comprises a true foreign body (ie, non-food) ingestion and food bolus impaction. Foreign body ingestion is not uncommon and accounts for roughly 4\% of urgent endoscopies undertaken.1 2 True foreign body ingestion is mostly encountered in paediatric populations with 75\% of cases occurring in less than 5-year-old children.1 Coins, buttons, plastic items, batteries and bones are common culprits.3 Food bolus impaction on the other hand is mostly seen in adults, usually accidental (95\% of cases). Steakhouse syndrome, animal bones, toothpicks and fish bones are the most frequent.2 True foreign body ingestion (coins and dentures) is rare in adults. Intentional true foreign body ingestion can be seen in patients with psychiatric illness, prisoners (secondary gain) and drug dealers (`body packing'). Underlying oesophageal conditions including eosinophilic oesophagitis (10\% in adults, up to 50\% in children), motility disorder, stenosis and diverticula are frequent.2 4 Most ingested foreign bodies will pass spontaneously.5 However, 10\%--20\% require endoscopic removal, and less than 1\% require surgical extraction or treatment of a complication.6 This review focuses on the management of foreign bodies located in the upper gastrointestinal tract, in adults. The quality of evidence of the guidelines is low; however, substantial clinical experience provides strong levels of recommendation.7 8 The management of rectal foreign bodies mostly relies on surgical, transanal extraction and is not detailed herein. Precise history (type of foreign body, time of onset) is essential. Physical examination is also mandatory. Most patients are asymptomatic. Symptoms arise when the foreign body is stuck in the oesophagus or when a complication occurs (obstruction and perforation).9 Emesis, retching, blood-stained saliva, hypersialorrhoea, wheezing and/or respiratory distress in non-communicative patients (children and psychiatric patients) are suggestive of foreign body impaction.7 Oesophageal impaction (food bolus) is often symptomatic: retching, {\dots}}

      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND: Previous reports of foreign-body ingestions focused primarily on accidental ingestions. OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics and management of foreign-body ingestions, with predominantly intentional ingestion, in a lower socioeconomic status population. DESIGN: A retrospective case series. SETTING: An urban county hospital. PATIENTS: Patients {$>$}/=17 years old, with foreign-body ingestions between 2000 and 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Characteristics of ingestion cases, endoscopic extraction, need for surgery, and complications. RESULTS: Among 262 cases, 92\% were intentional, 85\% involved psychiatric patients, and 84\% occurred in patients with prior ingestions. The time from ingestion to presentation was {$>$}48 hours in 168 cases (64\%). The overall success rate for endoscopic extraction was 90\% (165/183 cases). Surgery was performed in 30 cases (11\%) and was more common for objects beyond the pylorus versus objects above the pylorus (16/43 [37\%] vs 10/151 [7\%], respectively) and in cases with a greater delay from ingestion to presentation (25/168 [15\%] if {$>$}48 hours vs 4/77 [5\%] if {$<$}/=48 hours) and from presentation to intervention (15/40 [38\%] if {$>$}48 hours vs 14/165 [8\%] if}

      \field{abstract}{Surgical procedures have been employed for the relief of several pathologic conditions in the esophagus, the most common being the impaction of foreign bodies, cardiospasm, benign cicatricial stricture, carcinoma and diverticula. Impacted foreign bodies are now much less commonly dealt with by surgical means because of the easier and less dangerous method, in the hands of experts, of extraction through the esophagoscope, while surgical procedures have been almost eliminated from the treatment for cardiospasm. In this article the last three conditions, essentially, are considered.Until within the past fifty years the esophagus received scant attention from the surgeon in spite of the well recognized pathologic conditions for which, theoretically, surgical procedures might well have been indicated. This is all the more striking when one remembers that the ancient Hindoos operated on the bladder for stone, and that Herophilus of the Alexandrian School used the knife boldly on such internal organs}

      \field{abstract}{To find foreign bodies in the stomach is by no means rare, in fact, the medical literature is so replete with reported cases that one hesitates to add another unless it is of unusual interest. Many of the patients are children who pick up objects and swallow them accidentally or intentionally. In the normal adult the presence of foreign bodies in the stomach is usually the result of the accidental swallowing of articles held in the mouth, although at times one sees people, otherwise normal, who have the habit of swallowing hair and other objects. This habit may be accentuated in some insane patients, and it is from this group that the strangest and largest number of objects have been recovered at operation, or more often at autopsy.

      \field{abstract}{This work reflects on the character of the modalities that non-status migrants are deploying in the context of current politics of the camp, with special attention to the Italian context. It will suggest that once the possibilities of dissent through the voice (the political tool par excellence in a liberal democracy, and one associated primarily with rationality and the capacity for reason) are foreclosed, migrants tend to resort to another powerful tool: their own body. Detainees have made their bodies speak by resorting to practices of self-mutilation, hunger strike, suicide attempts, and lips and eyes sewing. Detainees' violent acts of dissent are not dissimilar from the violent modalities used, a few centuries earlier, by some enslaved people who chose liberty through death. The aim is not so much to make comparison between the two figures, but to emphasise the way in which, under conditions of extreme control, subjugation or unfreedom, acts of dissent and resistance -- and thus acts of politics, as articulated in Rancière's concept of dissensus -- are not necessarily enacted through democratic practices but, on the contrary, through whatever modalities are available to them, including violent (self-harm) modalities.}

      \field{abstract}{Deliberate foreign body ingestion is a significant issue in prison and psychiatric settings. It is associated with serious physical complications, including bowel obstruction, perforation and haemorrhage. Episodes of deliberate foreign body ingestion were identified retrospectively from 5417 incident records from two inpatient forensic services (one mental health and one intellectual disability) over a one year timeframe, using related search terms. Rates were compared according to gender, diagnosis and level of security. Incidents of deliberate foreign body ingestion were found to occur on average every 2.7 days across the study population, with 133 incidents recorded over a one year period, accounted for by 27 patients. Women and patients in lower levels of security were significantly more likely to engage in deliberate foreign body ingestion. Staff responses to this behaviour were highly variable. Deliberate foreign body ingestion occurs frequently within inpatient forensic services, and can have significantly detrimental physical implications for affected patients. Further research should investigate the psychiatric and intellectual disability profile of such individuals in further detail, as well as exploring patient narratives; both of which will help inform development of treatment strategies.

      \field{abstract}{INTRODUCTION: The swallowing of foreign bodies can be accidental or intentional. The majority of the cases of accidental foreign body ingestion are observed in children. In adults, foreign body ingestion can be accidental, related to specific pathological changes of the digestive tract, or deliberate, as observed in patients with psychiatric diseases or in those released from the prison. CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with symptoms including choking, drooling from the mouth, holding his neck, and aphonia. He had a history of psychiatric illness with suicidal ingestion of a foreign body. After stabilization, he was sent for chest radiograph, which revealed a significant radiopaque shadow the shape of a spanner, occupying the whole length of the esophagus. Emergency rigid esophagoscopy was performed to save the patient's life. DISCUSSION: The patient swallowed the largest hard foreign body to harm himself or his family, to get the attention of his family, or as a suicide attempt. Such patients require urgent intervention by rigid esophagoscopy to reduce the risk of complications and to save the patients' lives. Further follow-up is essential due to the possibility of repeated foreign body ingestion. CONCLUSION: While taking care of psychiatric patients, close observation by family members is mandatory to prevent them from harming themselves and to prevent suicide attempts by swallowing sharp, hard, large, and dangerous foreign bodies such as the size 17 wrench spanner observed in the present case.}

      \field{abstract}{Purpose: Few case studies in the literature report on adult patients with intentional foreign body ingestion. Prisoners deliberately ingest foreign bodies, such as cylindrical alkaline batteries and razor blades, to achieve hospitalization or commit suicide. The purpose of this paper is to present a case of deliberate ingestion of batteries and razor blades by an inmate. Design/methodology/approach: The authors present a case of an incarcerated man in Greece, who intentionally ingested three cylindrical alkaline batteries and three razor blades wrapped in aluminum foil. Findings: The patient was treated conservatively with serial radiographs and was subsequently discharged without complication. This paper discusses the complications and examine the current guidelines available. Originality/value: To best of authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a simultaneous ingestion of batteries and razor blades. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)}

      \field{abstract}{Self-\-harm within immigration detention centres has been a widely documented phenomenon, occurring at far higher rates than the wider community. Evidence suggests that factors such as the conditions of detention and uncertainty about refugee status are among the most prominent precipitators of self-\-harm. While important in explaining self-h\- arm, this is not the entire story. In this paper, we argue for a more overtly political interpretation of detainee self-\-harm as resistance and assess the ethical implications of this view, drawing on interviews with detainees from Australia's offshore system. Self-\-harm by detainees is not only a medical 'condition' arising in response to oppression but a form of political action to lessen or contest it. We first establish how self-\-harm could be conceptualised as resistance. We then discuss its political purpose, noting it serves at least three functions: intrinsic, instrumental and disruptive or coercive. Viewing detainee self-\- harm as political resistance is a supplement to (rather than a substitute for) a medical approach. However, conceptualising self-\-harm this way has several advantages, namely, moving away from the idea that such behaviour is 'maladaptive', recognising detainees as political agents, combatting government claims of 'manipulation' and 'blackmail' and clarifying the duties of healthcare workers who work in detention.}

      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE: Deliberate foreign body ingestion (DFBI) is often impulsively driven, repetitive and refractory to intervention and frequently necessitates multiple medical interventions. As such, the frustrations among health care providers are great, and the financial toll on health care is significant. Nevertheless, the literature on DFBI is sparse, and suggestions for treatment planning and management are limited. The authors sought to investigate and uncover efficacious treatments and strategies for preventing reoccurrence in DFBI. We build on earlier work by offering both broad and diagnosis-specific management strategies. METHOD: A literature review was performed addressing the presentation, management and prevention of reoccurrences of DFBI. Four cases of DFBI are presented illustrating those psychiatric diagnoses (psychosis, malingering, obsessive-compulsive disorder and borderline personality disorder) most frequently encountered in hospital practice. Both broad and specific treatment approaches are presented. RESULTS: Patients engaging in DFBI are best managed through a multidisciplinary approach, following acute medical management. Successful strategies for the prevention of reoccurrences of DFBI are inconclusive. CONCLUSION: Understanding the function of this behavior is critical in developing treatment for patients who engage in these dangerous, potentially life-threatening, self-injurious behaviors. An amalgam of medical, pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral interventions is recommended, as is additional research.}

      \field{abstract}{Intentional foreign body ingestions (FBIs) are commonly seen in adult patients with intellectual disabilities, substance use, severe psychiatric conditions, or external motivations, but these cases are rarely reported in the psychiatric literature. We present the case of a patient with an extensive history of FBIs and suicide attempts and a multitude of psychiatric diagnoses including borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder from significant abuse in foster care, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and pica. During the single hospitalization described in this report, she had multiple incidents of self-harm, aggression, and 9 FBIs. A multidisciplinary team involving psychiatry, emergency medicine, gastroenterology, surgery, internal medicine, nursing, social work, behavioral health technicians, case management, chaplain, the legal department, police officers, and hospital maintenance was necessary for care coordination. Interventions included 8 endoscopies and an abdominal surgery to retrieve swallowed foreign bodies, pain management, psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions for agitation, and environmental precautions to minimize the risk of ingestion. Ultimately, to prevent further trauma and limit additional opportunities for FBI, a collaborative decision was made with the patient to discharge her to her home with outpatient psychologist and psychiatrist support. This case describes the complexities of hospital management of a patient with intentional recurrent FBI, highlighting the importance of a critical assessment of risk versus benefit for prolonging hospitalization. Development of practical management protocols and risk assessments for continued hospitalization is necessary for patients with recurrent intentional FBIs.}

      \field{abstract}{Thoughout the world the number of refugees and asylum seekers continues to increase at an astonishing rate. Given that most will have left their country due to persecution, war, or appalling violations of their human rights, many will have specific mental health needs. Cultural and socioeconomic factors play a major role in expressions of distress, help seeking, pathways into care, and acceptance or rejection of treatments. Being a refugee or asylum seeker raises questions about an individual's self respect and altered identity. Too often though, the needs of this population are ignored by policy makers and clinicians, and these people are left to fend for themselves. Mental Health of Refugees and Asylum Seekers presents both the theoretical and practical aspects of the mental health needs of refugees and asylum seekers. It looks at the impact of migration on mental health and adjustment, collective trauma, individual identity, and diagnostic fallacies. A practical section highlights cultural factors, ethnopsychopharmacology, therapeutic interaction, therapeutic expectation and psychotherapy. The final part of the book focuses on special problems - such as bereavement, sexual violence, and post traumatic stress disorders, as well as considering mental health problems in special groups, such as child refugees. This book will be an essential resource for all mental health professionals- helping them better understand the needs of refugees and asylum seekers, how their problems can be managed, and how they can best be helped.}

      \field{abstract}{Introduction{\enspace} Asylum seekers and refugees are at an elevated risk of self-\-harm, with younger age and traumatic experiences found to further increase such risk. Despite this, evidence regarding self-h\- arm among unaccompanied asylum seekers and refugee minors has not been synthesised. As self-\-harm among minors is a risk factor for a range of adverse clinical and social outcomes, including suicide, such information may help to inform evidence-\- based prevention strategies among these vulnerable populations. This systematic review will synthesise findings from the literature regarding the prevalence, methods and characteristics of self-h\- arm, including risk and protective factors, among unaccompanied asylum seekers and refugee minors internationally. Methods and analysis{\enspace} We searched key electronic databases (PsycINFO, Scopus, PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE) and grey literature for relevant studies published in English from database inception to 10 February 2023. Our primary outcome is self-h\- arm among unaccompanied asylum seekers and/or refugee minors. With the exception of single-c\- ase studies, clinical trials and case-\-control studies, we will include all types of study design that examine the prevalence of self-h\- arm in unaccompanied asylum seekers and/or refugee minors. We will exclude dissertations, conference abstracts, letters, book chapters, editorials, study registrations, registered protocols and qualitative studies. Only studies reporting on participants aged {$<$}18 years will be eligible for inclusion. The Methodological Standard for Epidemiological Research Scale will be used to assess the quality of included studies. If there are sufficient studies and homogeneity between them, we will conduct meta-a\- nalyses to calculate pooled estimates of self-h\- arm rates, as well as comparisons between subgroups of relevance. If the studies do not report sufficient data, or there is substantial heterogeneity, we will provide a narrative synthesis of the findings. Ethics and dissemination{\enspace} This review is exempt from ethics approval. Our findings will be disseminated through peer-r\-eviewed publications and conference presentations.

      \field{abstract}{A 29-year-old female with a history of psychiatric disorder that was treated with thorazine and lithium, but was not taking any of her medications, was brought to the hospital after being witnessed by her family swallowing razor blades. Her only symptom was abdominal cramping. On examination, her vital signs were stable and she appeared to be in no acute distress. On examination, she had multiple old self-inflicted scars on her arms, wrists and thighs. She admitted that she had swallowed ten razor blades after coating them with chewing gum but she denied any intentions to hurt herself. Vitals were stable and her physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory work up was within normal with stable hemoglobin and hemarocrit. Acute abdominal X-ray showed razor blades overlying the upper abdomen, likely in the gastric antrum (Figure 1). Four days later, repeated X-rays showed multiple razor blades present in the rectum (Figure 2). Eventually, all razor blades were passed. Psychiatry was consulted for management of schizoaffective schizophrenia and she was restarted on her home medications. She was discharged in a stable condition.}

      \field{abstract}{A 30-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of abdominal discomfort. An abdominal radiograph was done, revealing ten rectangular razor blades measuring 5 {\texttimes} 2 cm. The patient was taken to the operating room and a flexible esophago-gastroduodenoscopy was performed. Attempts at retrieval, using both a gastric overtube and an inverted hood, were unsuccessful due to the shape and size of the blades. She was transferred to a regular medical floor and managed conservatively with serial abdominal radiographs. Over the next week, she passed the razor blades transanally without further event---all were still wrapped in paper and chewing gum---and was cleared to be discharged home.}

      \field{abstract}{Introduction: The Swallowing Of Foreign Bodies Can Be Accidental Or Intentional. The Majority Of The Cases Of Accidental Foreign Body Ingestion Are Observed In Children. In Adults, Foreign Body Ingestion Can Be Accidental, Related To Specific Pathological Changes Of The Digestive Tract, Or Deliberate, As Observed In Patients With Psychiatric Diseases Or In Those Released From The Prison. Case Presentation: A 42-Year-Old Male Was Admitted To The Emergency Department With Symptoms Including Choking, Drooling From The Mouth, Holding His Neck, And Aphonia. He Had A History Of Psychiatric Illness With Suicidal Ingestion Of A Foreign Body. After Stabilization, He Was Sent For Chest Radiograph, Which Revealed A Significant Radiopaque Shadow The Shape Of A Spanner, Occupying The Whole Length Of The Esophagus. Emergency Rigid Esophagoscopy Was Performed To Save The Patient'S Life. Discussion: The Patient Swallowed The Largest Hard Foreign Body To Harm Himself Or His Family, To Get The Attention Of His Family, Or As A Suicide Attempt. Such Patients Require Urgent Intervention By Rigid Esophagoscopy To Reduce The Risk Of Complications And To Save The Patients' Lives. Further Follow-Up Is Essential Due To The Possibility Of Repeated Foreign Body Ingestion. Conclusion: While Taking Care Of Psychiatric Patients, Close Observation By Family Members Is Mandatory To Prevent Them From Harming Themselves And To Prevent Suicide Attempts By Swallowing Sharp, Hard, Large, And Dangerous Foreign Bodies Such As The Size 17 Wrench Spanner Observed In The Present Case.}

      \field{abstract}{The Topic Of Foreign Body Ingestion Has Received Extensive Coverage In The Areas Of Surgery, Emergency Medicine And Pediatrics. A Subset Of This Topic, The Intentional Ingestion Of Foreign Bodies, However, Is Much Less Common, And Involves Subtleties In Evaluation And Management Not Usually Seen In Accidental Ingestions. Here, We Report A Case Of Ingestion Of A Rolled, Metal Tuna Can Lid In A Male Prison Inmate Previously Diagnosed With Depression And Paranoid Schizophrenia. Following Evaluation By The Surgical Team, The Foreign Body Was Removed By Laparotomy And The Patient Was Discharged Back To The Prison Without Complication. In Many Cases, Ingestions Ofthis Type Involve A Command Hallucination Ordering The Patient To Swallow The Foreign Body. Interestingly, The Patient In The Present Case Reported Auditory Hallucinations Commanding Him Not To Swallow The Can Lid.}

      \field{abstract}{Foreign Body (FB) ingestion is usually seen in children but can occur in adults accidentally or intentionally in certain group of patients. Various objects have been reported in medical literature but toothbrush ingestion is rare. Although most of these FB pass through the alimentary tract without consequences but the spontaneous passage of toothbrush is an exception. We report a case of perforation of third part of duodenum by 17 cm long toothbrush causing peritonitis that was removed after exploratory laparotomy. The duodenum was repaired and though postoperative period was long but there were no complications.}

      \field{abstract}{Introduction And Importance: Endoscopic Foreign Body Retrieval In The Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Is Well Established, However Indications For Endoscopy For Retained Foreign Bodies In The Lower Gastrointestinal Tract And Specifically The Right Colon Is Still Being Navigated [3]. A Pubmed And Google Scholar Search Discovered A Variety Of Case Reports Detailing Various Methods And Indications For Endoscopic Retrieval Of Right Sided Colonic Foreign Bodies. This Case Report Endeavors To Supplement The Literature So That Guidelines Can One Day Be Established For Colonoscopic Retrieval Of Right-Sided Foreign Bodies. Case Presentation: 36-Year-Old Male Prisoner Swallowed 6.5~Cm Nail Clippers With A Long-Standing History Of Intentional Foreign Body Ingestion (Fbi) Including Multiple Laparotomies For Foreign Body Retrievals. Computerized Tomography (Ct) Was Used Initially To Confirm The Position Of The Nail Clippers. After Almost Two Weeks Of Failure Of The Foreign Body (Fb) To Move Beyond The Caecum As Demonstrated On Plain Abdominal X-Rays, The Patient Had A Colonoscopy With Successful Retrieval Of The Fb. Clinical Discussion: This Case Report Hopes To Encourage The Consideration Of Colonoscopy For Retrieval Of Right Sided Colonic Foreign Bodies That Have Failed To Pass On Their Own And Where An Operation May Come With Increased Risk (Multiple Laparotomies, Multiple Comorbidities, And Higher Anaesthetic Risk For A General Anaesthetic). Colonoscopy/Endoscopy Still Has Inherent Risk And This Patient Did Have An Episode Of Temporary Laryngospasm That Required Intubation And Monitoring In The Intensive Care Unit Post Operatively. Despite This The Patient Recovered And Was Discharged Day One Post Procedure Without Further Complication. The Case Report Has Been Reported In Line With The Scare 2020 Criteria (Agha Et Al., 2020 [2]). Conclusion: Indications For Consideration Of Endoscopic Retrieval Of Foreign Bodies In The Right Colon Have Not Been Entirely Detailed As Endoscopy Is For Upper Gastrointestinal Foreign Bodies. This Case Report Documents The Indications For Endoscopy In The Clinical Context Of A Recurrent Fbi And A History Of Multiple Laparotomies With Failure Of The Fb To Move Beyond The Caecum.}

      \field{abstract}{Background. Foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract are important morbid and mortal clinical conditions. Particularly, emergency treatment is required for cutting and drilling bodies. The majority of ingested foreign bodies (80-90\%) leave gastrointestinal tract without creating problems. In 10-20\% of cases, intervention is absolutely required. Less than 1\% of cases need surgery. In this paper, we present a schizophrenia patient who swallowed multiple lighters. Case. A 21-year-old male schizophrenic patient who uses psychotic drugs presented to the emergency department with the complaints of abdominal pain, severe vomiting, and inability to swallow for a week. His physical examination revealed epigastric tenderness. A plain radiograph of the abdomen revealed multiple tiny metallic densities. Gastroscopy was performed. The lighters were not allowing the passage, and some of them had penetrated the gastric mucosa, and bezoars were observed. One lighter was extracted with the help of the polypectomy snare. Other lighters as a bezoar were removed by surgery. Conclusion. Excessive vomiting of swallowed foreign bodies in the etiology of psychotic patients should be kept in mind. Endoscopic therapy can be performed in the early stages in these patients, but in the late stage surgery is inevitable.}

After The Goldfishes Had Gone Down Smoothly, A Bronze Catfish Was Ingested. Unaware Of The Morphology And Anti-Predator Behaviour Of This Species, A Healthy But Intoxicated 28-Year-Old Man Got A Surprise. The Catfish Erected And Locked The Spines Of Its Pectoral Fins And Got Lodged In The Hypopharynx. After Several Hours, He Presented Himself At The Emergency Department With Dysphonia And Dysphagia. The Fish Had To Be Removed Endoscopically. Intubation And Admittance To The Intensive Care Unit Was Necessary Due To Laryngeal Oedema. Two Weeks Postoperatively, The Patient Made A Full Recovery And Donated The Fish To The Natural History Museum Rotterdam. The Publicity Generated By Public Exhibition Of The 'Do-Not-Swallow-Fish' Emphasised The Official Jackass Warning: '.. Do Not Attempt Any Of The Stunts You'Re About To See'.}

The Blade Meanwhile Passed Into The Jejunum And Was Localized Intraoperatively With A C-Arm Fluoroscope. After Jejunotomy And Removal Of The Blade, The Opening Of The Small Bowel Was Closed With Intracorporeal Hand-Suturing Technique. Postoperative Recovery Was Quick And Uneventful. On The Evidence Of The Case History Presented, The Laparoscopic Removal Of A Foreign Body From The Gastrointestinal Tract Can Be Judged A Convenient Procedure.}

      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND: Ingestion of foreign bodies may be seen unconsciously or intentionally in patients with mental health problems. Most cases pass through the esophagus slowly; however, in some cases, the tumor may be located in narrower areas of the digestive tract that require endoscopic or surgical intervention. This study describes a rare case of successful removal of more than 450 pieces of metal objects from the stomach of a 36-year-old man via ingestion of foreign bodies at Imam Khomeini Hospital in Ahvaz. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old male patient (Aryan race) presented with complaints of chronic abdominal pain, frequent vomiting, and intolerance to liquids and food. The patient's companions mentioned a history of gradual ingestion of small metal objects 3~months prior. The patient was conscious and had stable vital signs. In the patient's X-ray and endoscopy, multiple metal objects inside the patient's stomach were observed, causing gastric outlet obstruction. The patient underwent gastrostomy surgery, and 452 screws, nuts, keys, stones, and other metal parts weighing 2900~g were removed from the stomach. Five days after the operation, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric service in good general condition and was diagnosed with psychosis, and her condition returned to normal at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Successful removal of this foreign body is rare. In chronic abdominal pain, especially in the context of psychiatric disorders, attention should be given to the ingestion of foreign bodies. In swallowing large amounts of sharp and metallic foreign objects, surgical intervention is necessary, especially in cases of obstruction, and saves the patient's life.}

      \field{abstract}{A 38-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia presented with pain and swelling of his testicles, with the right side worse than the left. Physical examination was remarkable for a very firm, large, right-sided scrotal mass. Testicular ultrasound was suspicious for neoplasm or abscess. On the pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan, which was obtained as part of a metastatic cancer work-up, two metallic foreign bodies were identified in the pelvis. On further questioning, the patient admitted to ingesting the nails 2 days prior, in a suicide attempt. We review the evaluation of unilateral scrotal pain and swelling, and incidental foreign body ingestion.}

      \field{abstract}{Introduction and Importance:~ The ingestion of foreign objects is a widespread health issue, with a higher occurrence in adults with psychosis. Case Presentation:~ The authors present the case of a 39-year-old man who arrived at the hospital with symptoms of abdominal distension and occasional black stools for a week. The patient was known to have schizophrenia but had not received regular hospital follow-up or treatment for the past 5 years. He had a history of exogenous stimulation, which led him to surreptitiously swallow metallic objects. Upon physical examination, he displayed abdominal distension and mild tenderness in the upper abdomen. Radiographs revealed multiple foreign objects in his stomach, leading to the decision for laparotomy, gastric opening, and removal of the foreign objects under general anesthesia. Clinical Discussion:~ Mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and multiple substance abuse, are recognized as being significant risk factors for ingesting foreign bodies. In such cases, it is crucial to intervene quickly. For patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms, the involvement of family caregivers is of even greater importance than endoscopic or surgical treatments. Conclusion:~ Foreign body ingestion is more prevalent in individuals with psychosis, highlighting the importance of ongoing care and follow-up for patients with mental illness.}

      \field{abstract}{This is a report of a 54-year-old schizophrenic patient with a 15-year history of ingesting metal objects (pica). He presented with severe anemia (hemoglobin of 3 g/dl and hematocrit of 8.3\%) and leukopenia (white blood count of 1,300/mm3). Work-up revealed copper deficiency (copper level of {$<$}0.05 microg/ml) and elevated zinc levels (280 microg/ml). The zinc toxicity was produced by the zinc content in the coins ingested by the patient over a period of many years. He was initially treated with -acetylcysteine and sodium bicarbonate followed by intravenous copper sulfate. He was also placed on Adolph's meat tenderizer and pancreatin thrice a day orally to loosen the massive amount of metallic objects including coins in his bowel and allow them to pass out in his feces. He was also continued on oral copper sulfate. His copper levels began to rise and reached a maximum of 0.72 microg/ml, and his zinc level fell to 153 microg/ml. However, as he refused surgery to remove the metal objects from his bowel and continued to ingest more coins, there was continued absorption of zinc, which later overcame the efforts to reduce the zinc level and increase copper levels in his blood. He finally succumbed to sepsis and multiorgan failure. Autopsy revealed a coin mass in the stomach weighing 1,870 grams in addition to a sigmoid volvulus caused by another coin bezoar in the colon.}

      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND: We present our experience with an as yet undescribed type of intentionally ingested metallic foreign body that was specially designed to arrest in its passage and cause perforation of the gastrointestinal tract. The two halves of a standard paper clip are tied crosswise with a rubber band, forming an elastic "cross." With its branches squeezed to lie parallel, the cross is wrapped into a small strip of paper and ingested. After being released from its wrapper, the branches of the cross spring back to their original position and cause perforation of the bowel wall. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: University hospital, Bulgaria. PATIENTS: Five male prisoners from the same jail undergoing laparotomy for foreign body removal during 1 week in January 1994. INTERVENTIONS: Laparotomy, removal of the foreign bodies through incisions of the bowel wall, immediate restoration of the gastrointestinal tract continuity, and peritoneal lavage and drainage. OUTCOME MEASURES: Morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Two of the patients were initially observed but subsequently underwent surgery for perforations of the gastrointestinal tract. Three of the patients underwent immediate operative treatment. There were 20 total crosses ingested; all foreign objects impacted and perforated the stomach (50\%), first duodenal portion (25\%), and fourth duodenal portion (20\%). There was no morbidity or mortality among the five patients treated. CONCLUSIONS: Because ingested crosses that have been released from their wrappers never move distally, the only definitive solution is to operate early.}

      \field{abstract}{INTRODUCTION: Foreign body ingestion causes a serious health problems like bleeding, abscess formation, septicemia, perforation, and obstruction of the esophagus, stomach and the intestine. In adults, foreign body ingestion is more common in the elderly, individuals with mental illness or who have an intellectual disability, alcohol poisoning, prison inmates, and drug traffickers. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 22 year old male patient who presented with abdominal distension and vomiting of ingested matter of two to three episodes per day of one month duration. He is a known schizophrenic patient for the past three years and has been on follow up at a nearby hospital. He swallowed metallic nails in an attempt to kill himself. On abdominal examination there was distension, and epigastric tenderness. His plain abdominal x-ray showed multiple radiopaque foreign body in the stomach. Similarly, abdominal ultrasound showed thickened gastric wall and multiple linear foreign bodies in the stomach. Then, with the impression of gastric outlet obstruction secondary to foreign body in the stomach, laparotomy plus gastrotomy plus foreign body removal and repair were done under general anesthesia. Dilated stomach, palpable mass on distal stomach and first part of duodenum, and adhesion between stomach, abdominal wall and liver was found intra operatively. CONCLUSION: Passage of curved metal through the throat is a rare case. Mentally ill individuals need close follow up and physiological consultation.}

      \field{abstract}{We reported an unusual case of a 26-year-old man presenting to surgical emergency as generalized peritonitis following an ingestion of multiple metallic sewing needles. The X-ray of his abdomen showed pneumoperitoneum and multiple metallic foreign bodies in the abdominal cavity. An ultrasonogram of his abdomen showed multiple metallic foreign bodies in the abdominal cavity and urinary bladder. Emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed. On laparotomy, gastric and duodenal perforation was found through which metallic sewing needles were protruding out. A peritoneal lavage was done, and all the sewing needles were extracted from the perforation site, paracolic gutter, liver parenchyma, and urinary bladder. The primary repair of the perforation with omental patching was done with the drainage of subhepatic space and pelvic cavity. These multiple ingested sewing needles led to the perforation of the stomach and the duodenum, which resulted in perforation peritonitis.}

Removal Through Flexible Endoscopy Is Generally The First-Line Approach But Rescue Oesophagotomy May Be Necessary For Foreign Bodies Impacted In The Upper Oesophagus. A 27-Year-Old Man Was Admitted In The Emergency Room After Intentional Ingestion Of A Wooden Spherical Object With A Central Hole. A Total Body Ct Scan Showed That The Object Was Completely Obstructing The Upper Oesophageal Lumen But There Were No Signs Of Perforation. In The Operating Room, A Weerda Diverticuloscope And A 5\,Mm 0{$^\circ$} Telescope Were Used To Visualise The Foreign Body Under General Anaesthesia. A Standard Endoscopic Biopsy Forceps Was Passed Through The Hole Of The Sphere And Was Retracted With The Jaws Open Allowing Transoral Extraction Without Complications.}

Timing Of Endoscopy For Ingested Foreign Bodies Varies And Depends On The Type And Location Of The Foreign Body In The Gastrointestinal Tract. We Present The Case Of A 26-Year-Old Man Who Was Brought From A Correctional Facility After Confessing To Have Swallowed A Few Shower Curtain Hooks. Abdominal X-Ray Done In The Emergency Room Revealed Multiple Foreign Bodies In The Stomach. An Upper Endoscopy Was Done In The Emergency Room With The Use Of An Overtube. The First Metal Piece Was Caught By A Snare And Removed With The Endoscope. All Other Foreign Bodies Which Were Present On The Abdominal X-Ray Could Not Be Visualized Initially As There Was Retained Food In The Stomach. After Multiple Attempts, Four Other Foreign Bodies Were Found And Each One Was Caught By The Forceps And Then The Scope Was Removed With The Forceps Holding The Foreign Body. There Was An Additional Foreign Body In The Right Mainstem Bronchus. The Patient Had Coughed Up The Foreign Body And Swallowed It Into The Gastrointestinal Tract. A Computed Tomography Scan Of Chest And Abdomen Was Done For Evaluation, Which Showed The Foreign Body In The Cecum. To Our Knowledge, This Is The First Case Report Of A Patient Intentionally Transferring A Foreign Body From One Organ System To Another. Colonoscopy Was Done And The Foreign Body Was Removed Rectally With A Snare Without Any Complications.}

      \field{abstract}{The Majority Of Ingested Foreign Bodies Will Pass Safely Through The Gastrointestinal Tract, But Long And Rigid Foreign Bodies Are Associated With An Increased Risk Of Gastrointestinal Impaction, Perforation And Bleeding. However, Large Foreign Bodies Which Have Been Swallowed Can Remain Trapped In The Stomach Over A Longer Period Of Time Without Any Significant Symptoms. This Case Report Describes The Case Of A 36-Year-Old Man Addicted To Heroin Who Purposefully Swallowed A Lighter (Double Wrapped In Cellophane) And Presented With Hematemesis And Melena 17 Months After The Ingestion Of The Foreign Body. The Lighter Was Successfully Removed Via Flexible Endoscopy Using A Polypectomy Snare. Swallowed Long And Rigid Foreign Bodies Trapped In The Stomach Over A Long Period Of Time Always Represent A Special Clinical And Endoscopic Challenge. In Cases Where Endoscopic Removal Fails, A Laparoscopic Surgical Approach May Be An Alternative.}

      \field{abstract}{Objective. Foreign body ingestion can be a challenge to multiprofessional approaches involving medical, surgical, neurological, and psychiatric teams., Case presentation. A 41-year-old male patient with intellectual disabilities presented after having swallowed approximately 20 sharp objects. While admitted to a psychiatric ward, surgeons removed a glove from his stomach endoscopically and pharmacologically facilitated the objects' complication-free bowel passage. The patient explained the swallowing as a means to release himself from tension induced by stress. His aberrant behavior also seemed to serve as a means to exert pressure on psychosocial workers. Other deviations included the pushing of sharp objects under the skin and multiple paraphiliae. As a child, the patient suffered from early psychological and physical traumatization. Both parents were allegedly physically abusive alcoholics., Conclusion. Apart from possible alcohol embryopathy and traumatic brain damage, meningitis, which the patient had at the age of three, is discussed as the most likely reason for his oligophrenia, associated with left-sided, temporo-parietal atrophy and epilepsy.}

      \field{abstract}{Pica is the persistent, culturally and developmentally inappropriate ingestion of non-nutritive substances (DSM-IV). AB is a 75-year-old lady with a 40-year history of schizophrenia and a 20-year history of pica who, at emergency laparotomy, had 175.32 Pounds of loose change in her stomach. Although pica has been reported to coexist with schizophrenia, she had had no positive symptoms of schizophrenia for at least 20 years. She has CT evidence of fronto-tempotal atrophy most marked on the left in the temporal lobe and on the right in the frontal lobe. Pica has been found to be related to cognitive deficits and hyperoral behaviour to temporal lesions. Neuropsychological testing reveals deficits closely related to these changes.}

      \field{abstract}{Foreign body ingestion is a common occurrence both in sane and insane population. Quite a good number of interesting and unusual cases of foreign body ingestion has been reported in the surgical literature from time to time. Ingested foreign bodies varying widely in number, size and character, may travel through a distensible tube of comparatively small diameter causing mechanical insult to the intestinal wall without producing symptoms or permanent tissue damage. Accidental ingestion of the foreign body is by far the most common. Deliberate ingestion may result from an act of insanity, a dare, a habit or medicinal therapy. Retention of elongated or pointed objects in the duodenum is a frequent problem. Long, sharp, objects may perforate the duodenum and have been known to migrate widely in the abdomen. Early removal of such objects has been advised. This case forms rarity due to the fact that the 7 inches knife remained in the Duodenum for 07 long years without causing major catastrophe. From Medline as well as Medical library search we failed to find such a case report till date where the metallic foreign body has remained in the GIT for such a long time.}

      \field{abstract}{A 20-year-old woman was brought to the surgical outpatient department with the strange history of irresistible desire to ingest metallic substances, mainly nails and pins. Her problems were initiated after she was forced to marry against her wish. She had no abdominal complaints and on examination the abdomen appeared absolutely normal. Plain radiograph confirmed numerous nails and pins inside her GI tract. On detailed psychologic evaluation, she was found to be suffering from deviant sexual behavior and marriage against her wish acted as a stressor in the development of this habit.}

      \field{abstract}{Foreign body ingestion is common but multiple magnet ingestion is rare. When more than one magnet is ingested, gastrointestinal complications may occur. The magnets are attracted to each other across the bowel wall and this may lead to pressure necrosis, perforation, fistula formation, or intestinal obstruction. We report a case of perforation following the ingestion of 12 small magnets. Clinicians who care for children should be aware of this hazard.}

      \field{abstract}{Abstract Foreign body ingestion is a common condition in clinical practice, thankfully most of the cases do not require any surgery as most foreign bodies can pass through the bowel without injuring it. Treatment depends on the size and kind of foreign bodies. When complications arise, patients may require urgent medical attention. Self-harm by sharp foreign body ingestion is a rare event that must always be promptly treated and should always be prevented. Psychiatric patients and inmates are the most affected population. A high index of suspicion is required to treat this rare condition, which may be preventable if there is adequate mental and medical therapy along with close monitoring and family support. We present the case of a 31-year-old psychiatric patient. After prompt treatment, two razor blades were surgically removed from her intestines. She fully recovered and is doing well on follow-up controls.}

      \field{abstract}{Introduction: Intentional Swallowing Of Foreign Objects Is A Relatively Rare Psychopathological Behavior. Adolescents And Young Adults May Carry Out This Act To Hurt Themselves Or Even Suicide. Often, Most Reports Related To Deliberate Swallowing Are Typically Either Surgical Or Gastrointestinal And Rarely Are Found In Psychiatric Articles; More Often, The Swallowed Foreign Objects (80 - 90\%) Are Disposed Of Spontaneously, And 10 - 20\% Of Them Require Endoscopy For More Study And Less Than 1\% Of Them Need Surgery To Be Removed Or Its Complications. Case Presentation: The Presented Patient Is A 17-Year-Old Girl Admitted To The Psychosomatic Ward Of Afzalipour Hospital Due To Intentional Poisoning. During The Year Before Her Admission, On Three Separate Occasions, She Detached The Knife Blade From Its Haft And Swallowed It. She Underwent Laparotomy Twice, One Time For Sigmoid Tearing And Damage To The Left Ovary, To Remove The Knife And Regeneration Of The Left Ovary And Sigmoid, And Another Time To Remove The Knife In Order Not To Cause Damage To Her Intestines. To Our Knowledge, This Is The First Reported Case In The World In Which An Ovary Has Been Damaged. Further Investigation Into Her Background Shows Some Extent Of Privation Due To Her Family'S Long-Term Economic Problems And Instability; Moreover, Sexual And Physical Abuse Was Also Confirmed. The Patient Was Prescribed Clozapine, Which Decreased Her Suicidal Behavior And Attempts Noticeably. Conclusions: Swallowing Foreign Bodies In This Patient Is Interpreted As Both Self-Punishment And Punishing Others (Those Who Thought They Were Hurt Or May Be Blamed For Their Despair Or Rejection). Intentional Swallowing Of Foreign Objects Behavior Is More Resistant Than Other Self-Harming Activities And May Have A Worse Prognosis. Swallowing Foreign Objects Requires A Sophisticated Process That, If Not Correctly Managed, May Result In Serious Complications; Therefore, Appropriate Psychiatric Counseling And Supportive Treatment Are Necessary For These Patients. Specific To This Patient Eliminating The Effects Of Suicide And Reaching Medical Stability With A Short Admission Was Necessary. Her Suicidal Behavior And Attempts Decreased Significantly After Starting Clozapine Treatment. Therefore, Clozapine Treatment Is Recommended For Patients With Suicidal Behavior And Self-Harm. {©} 2023, Brieflands. All Rights Reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{While both the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) have released guidelines on the management of ingested foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, neither has addressed indications or techniques for endoscopic removal of foreign bodies in the lower GI tract, perhaps due to the high likelihood of foreign body passage once the foreign body has reached the lower GI tract. We present the case of a 45-year-old woman presenting to the emergency department following the intentional ingestion of multiple screws and nails, complaining of acute abdominal pain and nausea. Imaging revealed four nails in the colon and two adjacent screws in the distal small bowel. In the absence of signs of acute obstruction or bowel perforation, she was admitted for expectant management but subsequently required endoscopic removal of two retained screws in the lower GI tract.}

      \field{abstract}{Pica is an eating disorder typically defined as the persistent eating of nonnutritive substances for a period of at least 1 month at an age in which this behavior is developmentally inappropriate. Acuphagia being consumption of sharp objects and Hyalophagia consumption of glass materials. Majority of the foreign bodies ingested into the gastrointestinal tract pass through the rectum asymptomatically, where as objects which are sharp, long, jagged may not be able to pass through. These types of objects may cause complications like impaction, leading to intestinal obstruction, ulceration, perforation and bleeding, thus need surgical exploration. In this case of young female with impacted bunch of bangles in the stomach and few in the small and large bowel, who was completely asymptomatic, needed gastrotomy with enterotomy for complete and successful retrieval of glass bangles.}

      \field{abstract}{Background: The ingestion of a foreign body is a common event. It most often occurs in young children. When ingestion occurs in adults, it is usually incidental. Individuals with psychiatric disorders, patients with dentures, and those with alcohol dependencies are more likely to ingest a foreign body accidentally. Other adults are known to ingest fish or chicken bones accidentally. The majority of ingested foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract without any complications. The minority of ingested foreign bodies will require endoscopic intervention while only {\textasciitilde}1\% require surgical intervention.}

Here we report our experience using endoscopic retrieval in a female centenarian with dyspnea and foreign bodies in the esophagus. She attempted suicide by swallowing 26 coins and two other foreign bodies. A gastroscope was used to remove all foreign bodies in the lower esophagus. In total, 26 coins, one ferrous ring and one cylindrical plastic object were retrieved. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical report on retrieval of so many foreign bodies in a single case.}

The Aim Of This Study Was To Present Our Experience And To Highlight The Importance Of Strict Follow-Up. Methods: Within 6 Months Period, Four Children Presented To The Emergency Department After Ingestion Of Multiple Magnets. We Reviewed Retrospectively The Patients' Documents, Radiological Reports, Operative Findings And Outcome. We Also Performed A Literature Search For All Reports Of Multiple Magnets Ingestion On Medline And Embase. Results: Daily Abdominal Radiographs To Monitor Migration Of Magnetic Objects Together With Clinical Examination Revealed Early Detection Of Perforations In Two Patients. Explorative Laparoscopy And Suturing Of Perforations Resulted In A Rapid Recovery And Good Cosmetic Appearance. Literature Search Resulted In 44 Published Articles With A Total Of 52 Cases Of Multiple Magnet Ingestion In Children. Conclusions: This Report Stresses The Need For Prompt Follow-Up And Early Detection Of Complications In Order To Operate Those Patients Without Delay. Laparoscopy Is The Method Of Choice In Exploring The Abdomen When Perforation Is Suspected.}

      \field{abstract}{Introduction And Importance: A Bezoar Is An Indigestible Food Or Other Material Within The Gastrointestinal Tract. It Can Be Ingested Intentionally Or Accidentally. The Small Bowel Bezoar Prevalence Ranges Between 0.4~\% And 4~\%, And The Prevalence Is Less Than 0.5~\% For Gastric Bezoars. There Are Different Types Of Bezoars, But The Mention Of A Plastic Bezoar Rarely Appears In The Literature. To Our Knowledge, This Is The First Reported Case Of A Plastic Bezoar In The Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia. Case Presentation: A 58-Year-Old Woman Was Admitted For Acute Kidney Injury, And While Working Her Up, It Was Discovered That She Had A Possible Foreign Body On Computerized Tomography Scan. As A Result, She Underwent Exploratory Laparotomy With The Findings Of Plastic Foreign Objects Identified 90~Cm From The Ileocecal Valve And Other Objects Identified In The Stomach. Clinical Discussion: The Impaction Of These Materials Often Occurs In Narrow Areas Such As The Lower Esophagus, Duodenum, Ileocecal Valve Or Even The Anus. In This Unique Case, Two Points Of Impaction Were Noted: The First Was In The Small Bowel And The Second Point In The Stomach. The Approach To Such Cases Could Be Endoscopic Versus Surgical Or Even Chemical Dissolution As A Choice Of Treatment Is Dependent On Multiple Factors. Conclusion: The Approach To These Cases Is Multidisciplinary And Depends On The Availability Of Services And Resources At The Treating Hospital. Reporting Such Cases Helps In Managing Challenging Situations. Additionally, A Psychiatric Assessment Is A Crucial Step.}

Upon Initial History The Patient Denied Any Foreign Body Ingestion. Only After Computed Tomography (Ct) Scanning Of The Abdomen And Pelvis Did The Patient Admit To Deliberate Ingestion Of A Single United States Penny Coin. During Surgical Evaluation It Was Found That The Coin Had Lodged Near The Ileocecal Valve And An Inflammatory Mass Had Formed Around The Intraluminal Coin, Causing A 10 X 7 Cm Fibrous Tumor To Completely Obstruct The Small Bowel. It Is Thought That Oxidation Of The Coin, With Subsequent Exposure Of Its High Zinc Content, Instigated The Inflammatory Cascade.}

      \field{abstract}{Foreign body ingestion is frequent in children and generally associated with little morbidity. However, some foreign bodies are innocent when ingested as a single object, but may have harmful effect if numerous. We report a 9-year-old girl who swallowed 5 magnets, causing acute intestinal obstruction. At laparotomy, 2 magnets were found in the cecum and 3 in the transverse colon, attracting each other and clasping a segment of ileum in between, causing a complete obstruction of the small intestine. If numerous magnets are ingested, particular concern is advised, and if signs of intestinal distress develop, prompt laparotomy to prevent serious gastrointestinal complications should be performed.}

      \field{abstract}{Introduction. Unintentional Foreign Body Ingestion Commonly Occurs Accidentally In Children Aged Between 3 Months And 6 Years And At Advanced Ages Or Results From Psychiatric Disorders Such As Hallucination In Patients With Mental Retardation. Most Of The Ingested Foreign Bodies Are Naturally Discharged From The Body But Some Of Them May Require Surgical Intervention. Presentation Of Case. A 29-Year-Old Mentally Retarded Female Patient Was Admitted To The Emergency Service With A Two-Day History Of Abdominal Pain, Nausea, And Vomiting. Physical Examination Revealed Abdominal Tenderness, Defense, And Rebound On Palpation. Radiological Examination Revealed Diffuse Air-Fluid Levels And A Radiopaque Impression Of A Metal Object In The Right Upper Quadrant. The Metal Teaspoon Causing Ileal Perforation Was Extracted By Emergency Laparotomy. On Postoperative Day 7, The Patient Was Uneventfully Discharged Following A Psychiatric Consultation. Discussion. Foreign Body Ingestion Can Occur Intentionally In Children At Developing Ages And Old-Age Patients, Or Adults And Prisoners, Whereas It May Occur Unintentionally In Patients With Mental Retardation Due To Hallucination. However, Repeated Foreign Body Ingestion Is Very Rare In Individuals Other Than Mentally Retarded Patients. Conclusion. Mentally Retarded Patients Should Be Kept Under Close Surveillance By Surgeons And Psychiatrists Due To Their Tendency To Ingest Foreign Bodies.}

      \field{abstract}{Ingestion of sharp objects is a rare event. We report our experience in the care of prisoners who ingested razor blades and the in-time evolution of our management. This is a descriptive study including all detainees ingesting a razor blade, transferred from the prison to Farhat Hached University Hospital of Sousse, from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015. Thus, we counted 19 cases of swallowed razor blades in 16 prisoners; indeed, 1 prisoner ingested a razor blade three times and another had ingested a blade twice. Our study includes 19 episodes of swallowed razor blades. In 2 cases, these events were secondary to suicide attempts. In the other cases, it was an expression of discontent and rejection of the situation in the prison. Three patients had a psychiatric history. The mean age of the patients is 24 years. The initial clinical examination had not objectified signs of gastrointestinal perforation. Thoraco-abdomino-pelvic computed tomography scans allowed specifying the blade location in all cases. It also objectified a pneumo-mediastinum in 2 cases. The blade location was esophageal in 1 case, gastric in 6 cases, and in the small bowel in the other cases. The first 4 patients had surgical removal of the blade. In subsequent cases, surgical abstention was the rule, and spontaneous blade expulsion was observed. The average time of expulsion was 4 days. In our experience, surgical removal of sharp foreign bodies should not be performed systematically without complications.}

      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND: Meta-analysis of preclinical data is used to evaluate the consistency of findings and to inform the design and conduct of future studies. Unlike clinical meta-analysis, preclinical data often involve many heterogeneous studies reporting outcomes from a small number of animals. Here, we review the methodological challenges in preclinical meta-analysis in estimating and explaining heterogeneity in treatment effects. METHODS: Assuming aggregate-level data, we focus on two topics: (1) estimation of heterogeneity using commonly used methods in preclinical meta-analysis: method of moments (DerSimonian and Laird; DL), maximum likelihood (restricted maximum likelihood; REML) and Bayesian approach; (2) comparison of univariate versus multivariable meta-regression for adjusting estimated treatment effects for heterogeneity. Using data from a systematic review on the efficacy of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in animals with stroke, we compare these methods, and explore the impact of multiple covariates on the treatment effects. RESULTS: We observed that the three methods for estimating heterogeneity yielded similar estimates for the overall effect, but different estimates for between-study variability. The proportion of heterogeneity explained by a covariate is estimated larger using REML and the Bayesian method as compared with DL. Multivariable meta-regression explains more heterogeneity than univariate meta-regression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the importance of careful selection of the estimation method and the use of multivariable meta-regression to explain heterogeneity. There was no difference between REML and the Bayesian method and both methods are recommended over DL. Multiple meta-regression is worthwhile to explain heterogeneity by more than one variable, reducing more variability than any univariate models and increasing the explained proportion of heterogeneity.}

      \field{abstract}{Intentional ingestion of a foreign body in adults is a rare clinical presentation. This case is one of a 27-year-old Sudanese man who presented having swallowed a ballpoint pen intentionally. Clinical examination and plain chest radiograph exhibited no signs indicative of perforation with only a raised C reactive protein identified on blood tests. Subsequent gastroscopy revealed that the pen had simultaneously perforated the duodenum at both D1 and D3 requiring removal via a laparotomy. The patient fully recovered and was discharged 2 weeks postoperatively following psychiatric input. {©} 2017 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article).
