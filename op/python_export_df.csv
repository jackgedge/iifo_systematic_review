1975,"Davidoff, E.","Davidoff, Elliott; Towne, Jonathan B.",New York State Journal Of Medicine,Ingested foreign bodies,"Discusses 7 case histories of White male federal prisoners, ages 20-25, representing 18 instances of intentional ingestion of foreign bodies. 4 types of ingesters are indicated: psychotics, children, accidental swallowers, and manipulative swallowers. A high mortality rate has been reported among psychotic patients due to the number and bizarreness of the objects and the difficulty of making a firm diagnosis of such patients. The nonpsychotic patient who has swallowed a foreign body as a manipulative gesture is a type seen among prison populations. Diagnosis is facilitated by the intention of obtaining secondary gain. There is a marked tendency to repeat the action. Prison population manipulative swallowers are often uncooperative, demanding or refusing surgery at times. Their behavior makes patient management deviate from the ideal of expectant treatment. (18 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",,PsycINFO

Some tried to transfer the technique of indirect laryngoscopy on the  oesophagus by using a larynx speculum. In order to achieve an insight into the  oesophagus they separated its closed upper end by means of special retracting  instruments. Various instruments were developed for this purpose (by Voltolini,  Semeleder, Stoerk, Bevan, Waldenburg, Mackenzie) which however not proved to be  effective. Mostly angled or jointed tubes came into use which were stretched  after insertion. More successful were those applying simple straight tubes.  Except for Stoerk it was Kussmaul who had a sword-swallower swallow a tube  instead of a sword. Today flexible fiberglass endoscopes are used as well as  rigid tubes.",10.1055/s-2007-997999,PubMed

The purpose of this study was to  evaluate the ability of WBI, with and without metoclopramide pretreatment, to  clear the GI tract of foreign bodies using previously established WBI end points,  ie, the presence of a clear effluent or the administration of 2 L/h PEG-ELS for 5  hours. Eleven healthy, adult, male volunteers participated in this controlled,  two-phase, blinded, crossover study. Ten fluorescent coffee beans were ingested  after an overnight fast followed 1 hour later by 10 mg of metoclopramide syrup or  an equivalent volume of placebo; 30 minutes later, WBI with PEG-ELS was begun at  2 L/h. All volunteers received 10 L of PEG-ELS during a 5-hour period. No  statistically significant difference (P > .05) was found between the two  pretreatments. For the metoclopramide group, the mean number of beans passed was  equal to 3.8 (+/- 2.5 standard deviation [SD]; 1 to 8 R); the mean number at  clear effluent was equal to 2.3. For the placebo group, the mean number of beans  passed was equal to 3.5 (+/- 1.9 SD; 2 to 7 R), and the mean number at clear  effluent was equal to 2.3. In conclusion, the presence of a clear effluent or the  administration of 10 L of PEG-ELS are not valid markers for the termination of  WBI if complete elimination of a foreign body is required. Pretreatment with 10  mg of oral metoclopramide does not enhance the efficiency of WBI.",10.1016/0735-6757(94)90144-9,PubMed
1996,"Leder, S.","Leder, S. B.",Head & Neck,Gag reflex and dysphagia,"BACKGROUND: The gag reflex is a protective response that prevents foreign objects or noxious material from entering the pharynx, larynx, or trachea; it is not  elicited during a normal swallow. Although no data have been reported to support  a relationship between the gag reflex and dysphagia, the gag reflex is  nevertheless routinely assessed during the bedside dysphagia evaluation. The  purpose of the present study was to investigate whether absence of a gag reflex  is a predictor of dysphagia. METHOD: Fourteen consecutive adult subjects referred  for a bedside dysphagia evaluation because they were considered to be at  increased risk for aspiration, specifically due to absence of a gag reflex, were  investigated. In addition, the gag reflex was assessed in 69 normal adult  volunteers. RESULTS: Although all subjects were referred for bedside dysphagia  evaluations specifically because they had no gag reflex, 86% (12/14) were  nevertheless able to eat at least a puree diet. In addition, 86% (12/14) of  subjects with no gag reflex had normal velar movement, reinforcing the  physiologic differences between velar functioning during phonation and the gag  reflex. The gag reflex, traditionally considered part of the bedside dysphagia  evaluation, was absent in 13% (9/69) of nondysphagic subjects, raising further  doubts regarding its clinical relevancy. CONCLUSION: The absence of a gag reflex  does not appear to be a predictor of dysphagia.",10.1002/(sici)1097-0347(199603/04)18:2<138::aid-hed5>3.0.co;2-2,PubMed

The  two halves of a standard paper clip are tied crosswise with a rubber band,  forming an elastic ""cross."" With its branches squeezed to lie parallel, the cross  is wrapped into a small strip of paper and ingested. After being released from  its wrapper, the branches of the cross spring back to their original position and  cause perforation of the bowel wall. DESIGN: Case series.

L.",Journal Of Pediatric Surgery,"Pearls and perils in the management of prolonged, peculiar, penetrating esophageal foreign bodies in children","BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Most retained esophageal foreign bodies (FB) are identified soon after ingestion and are easily extracted. A minority of FB ingestions are  not identified for weeks to years and present significant problems for retrieval.  The purpose of this study was to describe the diagnostic and therapeutic  strategies needed to care for children who have chronic esophageal FBs. METHODS:  Five children were identified as having retained esophageal FBs 2 months to 2  years after ingestion. During the same 3-year period, 100 children who had acute  FBs were identified and had their foreign bodies removed endoscopically. The  average age of the children was 3 years (range, 2.4 to 3.5). RESULTS: The average  age of the five children identified in this study was 3 years. The items ingested  included coins, a heart pendant, a clothespin spring, and a toy soldier.  Complications from chronically retained foreign bodies were bronchoesophageal  fistula, mediastinitis, esophageal diverticulum, and lobar atelectasis. One  patient died from an aortoesophageal fistula. In all children, endoscopic removal  was attempted. Barium esophagram was then performed, and foreign bodies were  eventually removed via right thoracotomy. CONCLUSIONS: Long-retained esophageal  FBs are extremely morbid and life threatening. History most often identifies  excess salivation, new onset asthma, and/or recurrent upper respiratory  infections. Three diagnostic adjuncts are helpful in identifying the presence of  a long retained FB: (1) Chest x-ray (PA and lateral), (2) barium swallow, and (3)  esophagoscopy. Indications for thoracotomy for removal of foreign body include  (1) Poor endoscopic visualization of FB because of inflammatory tissue and (2)  Herald bleeding during endoscopy.",10.1016/s0022-3468(97)90554-6,PubMed

G.",Dysphagia,Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing with sensory testing feesst in healthy controls,"The purpose of this study was to introduce a new method of bedside assessment of both the motor and sensory components of swallowing called fiberoptic endoscopic  evaluation of swallowing with sensory testing (FEESST). This approach combines  the established bedside endoscopic swallowing evaluation with a more recently  described technique that allows objective determination of laryngopharyngeal (LP)  sensory discrimination thresholds by delivering air pulse stimuli to the mucosa  innervated by the superior laryngeal nerve via a flexible endoscope. A  prospective study was conducted of FEESST in 20 healthy control subjects, mean  age of 34 +/- 11 years. LP sensory thresholds were defined as either normal (<  4.0 mmHg air pulse pressure [APP]), moderate deficit (4.0-6.0 mmHg APP), or  severe deficits (> 6.0 mmHg APP). Subsequent to LP sensory testing, food of  varying consistencies, mixed with green food coloring, was given and attention  was paid to spillage, laryngeal penetration, pharyngeal residue, aspiration, and  reflux. Therapeutic maneuvers such as postural changes and airway protection  techniques were performed on each subject to determine if the assessed swallowing  parameters were affected by maneuvers. All patients completed the study; all had  normal LP sensory discrimination thresholds (2.9 +/- 0.7 mmHg APP). There were no  instances of spillage, laryngeal penetration, or aspiration. Two of 20 subjects  had pharyngeal residue and 2 of 20 had reflux. Institution of therapeutic  maneuvers resulted in a predictable change in the endoscopic view of the  laryngopharyngeal anatomy. FEESST provides comprehensive, objective sensory and  motor information about deglutition in the bedside setting and might have  implications for the bedside diagnosis and management of patients with dysphagia.",10.1007/pl00009561,PubMed

STUDY  DESIGN: Prospective study. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with oropharyngeal  dysphagia underwent videoendoscopy of swallowing to assess pharyngeal propulsion  as pathologic or nonpathologic, and aspiration. These features were compared with  those found on manometry and videofluoroscopy, which were considered as the  reference examinations. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative  predictive values of videoendoscopy were estimated, with their 95% confidence  intervals. RESULTS: A total agreement between videoendoscopy and videofluoroscopy  was found in 76.4% of cases for pharyngeal propulsion and in 82.3% for  aspiration. This rate for pharyngeal propulsion reached 82.3% between  videoendoscopy and manometry. Moreover, in 24 cases (70.5%) in which  videofluoroscopy and manometry agreed for pharyngeal propulsion, 22 were assessed  similarly through fiberoscopy. When using fluoroscopy and manometry as reference  examinations, videoendoscopy detected nearly 90% (95% confidence interval [CI] =  0.80, 1.0) of impaired pharyngeal propulsion. Concerning aspiration, 70% (95% CI  = 0.54, 0.85) of events detected by videoendoscopy were also observed on  videofluoroscopy. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive  values of videoendoscopy reached a higher rate (90% to 92.8%) when agreement was  found between fluoroscopy and manometry. CONCLUSIONS: Videoendoscopy is an  examination that can be used to detect inexpensively pharyngeal propulsion  disorders and aspiration episodes.",10.1097/00005537-199811000-00022,PubMed

METHODS: Retrospective review of patients treated for esophageal  coin ingestion at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin over a 1-year period using  bougienage or endoscopic retrieval was conducted. (inclusion criterion) RESULTS:  Twenty-seven patients were evaluated over the 1-year study period. Two patients  spontaneously passed the coins before arrival and needed no further treatment.  Twelve patients met criteria for bougienage, and this treatment was successful in  10 of the 12 patients. Mean length of hospital stay was 2.15 hours, and the mean  cost was $546. Thirteen patients were treated successfully with endoscopy. The  mean length of hospital stay was 22.7 hours, and the mean cost was $5,230. There  were no complications in any of the 25 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Bougienage is  equally safe, more efficient, and much less expensive than endoscopy for  treatment of esophageal coins in properly selected patients. Nearly half of the  patients were excluded from bougienage because of delayed presentation alone.

METHODS: The records of  children admitted to a single institution who had a history of foreign body  ingestion over 33 years were reviewed. Symptoms, radiological findings, and  endoscopic findings were assessed. RESULTS: Foreign bodies were detected in 552  (43%) of the 1,265 children admitted. The age of the children ranged from 6  months to 16 years (mean, 5.2 years). The preschool toddlers (mean age, 3.8  years) were most prone to ingest inanimate objects. The most common objects were  coins (49%) and nonmetallic sharp objects (NMSO; 31%). Although x-rays could  detect all the metallic objects and 86% of glass objects, the sensitivity of fish  bone detection is only 26%. Absence of symptoms was common (50% in metallic group  and 29% in NMSO group). Forty-one percent of coins and 95% of NMSO were lodged at  sites suitable for removal by direct laryngoscopy alone with success rates of 86%  and 77%, respectively. There were 3 disease-related complications and 1  mortality. Two of these children were mentally retarded and presented late.  CONCLUSIONS: Efforts for prevention of ingestion of inanimate foreign body should  focus on the preschool toddler group. Particular attention should be paid to  mentally retarded children with vague gastrointestinal symptoms. Absence of  symptoms does not preclude presence of foreign body in children.

Nonoperative  approaches such as dietary therapy, enzymatic dissolution, and endoscopic removal  have been regarded as the mainstays of therapy. The purpose of this paper is to  determine the efficacy of electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) as an alternative  form of treatment of gastric bezoars. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 1988 and  May 1996, 11 patients with large gastric bezoars, defined as those greater than 5  cm in diameter, received endoscopic-guided fragmentation using electrohydraulic  lithotripsy. Nine of our patients had a history of ingestion of ""Pho Pu Zi"",  (Cordia dichotoma Frost. f.), one of orange pitch, and one of ingestion of  persimmon. RESULTS: The 11 patients in the study underwent EHL for the treatment  of their gastric bezoars, with a 100% success rate, which was defined as the lack  of residual bezoar seen on post-procedure barium study or endoscopy done 2 days  after the procedure. Patients were followed-up clinically for 30-68 months, with  seven of the 11 patients undergoing a barium study with no residual bezoar noted.  No procedure-related complications were seen, except for pharyngeal pain which  was most probably secondary to the placement of the silicon overtube.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six U.S. copper-based pre-1982 pennies, 12 zinc-based post-1982 pennies, a quarter, a nickel, and a dime were exposed to postprandial concentrations of gastric acid (0.15N HCl) for 7 days, and radiographs were obtained daily. Half the zinc-based coins were scraped to disrupt their copper coating. Coins were weighed at the start and completion of the study. RESULTS: Post-1982 zinc-based pennies developed radiolucent corrosive changes within 24 hours. Erosions on the coins became more apparent over time. Frank holes were present on day 2. The weights of these coins decreased 5%-8% during the study. Pre-1982 copper pennies and silver-colored coins showed no change on radiographs over 7 days. CONCLUSION: Unexpected radiolucent corrosions may develop in post-1982 zinc alloy pennies when retained in the stomach. Coins have long been considered innocuous foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tracts of children. However, because of the potential for ulceration and zinc-related morbidity, closer clinical and radiographic observation is warranted.

METHODS: The esophageal structure and  function of 8 patients treated for AFBI requiring endoscopic removal of  alimentary foreign bodies in 6 of them (up to 4 times in 1 case) were  investigated by barium meal, esophagoscopy-biopsy, pH-metering, pull-through  stationary manometry, and 24-hour ambulatory manometry. The results were compared  with those in a group of age-matched regular refluxers (n = 14) without AFBI.  RESULTS: Six boys and 2 girls aged 108 +/- 59 months had impaction. Six children  had symptoms of GER like vomiting during infancy, heartburn, or respiratory tract  disease. Barium swallow ruled out stenosis in all patients and showed small  hiatal hernias in 3. All had endoscopic and histologic esophagitis (moderate to  severe in 6), and one had Schatzki ring. All but one (who had 8.45 mm Hg) had  normal lower esophageal sphincter pressure (16.2 +/- 4.7 mm Hg, mean +/- SD), and  all showed normal sphincteric relaxation. Esophageal body motility was not  significantly different from that in regular refluxers except in 6 children in  whom energetic distal peristalsis after reflux episodes could be seen  particularly during the night. Three of them had amazingly powerful distal waves  during the day and even stronger, simultaneous, wide and bizarre-shaped waves  during sleep. Symptoms improved in all cases after antireflux medication. Four  patients were cured after antireflux surgery. CONCLUSIONS: AFBI is a dramatic but  practically unheard of symptom of GER in children. It should be differentiated  from dysphagia and reveals motor dysfunction, sometimes severe, of the esophageal  body in the absence of sphincteric obstruction. Antireflux medication or surgery  were uniformly successful in our patients.",10.1053/jpsu.2001.26381,PubMed

It was usually preceded by minor sentinel bleeding, Two patients presented esophagoparaprosthetic fistula (EPPF). One patient presented primary AEF that was contained by a large thrombus in the communication. The clinical picture in these 3 patients involved severe sepsis without hemorrhage. Results: Two patients died as a result of massive hemorrhage before assessment and surgical treatment could be undertaken. One 77-year-old woman presenting EPPF refused to undergo surgery and died because of infection. The remaining 6 patients underwent surgical treatment with various outcomes. One man died during thoracotomy caused by exsanguinating hemorrhage. One woman presenting EPPF was treated by exclusion followed by ascending aorta to abdominal aorta bypass grafting, removal of the prosthesis, esophageal exclusion, and directed esophageal fistula. She died of infection. The other 4 patients were treated by in situ aortic allograft replacement. The damaged esophagus was repaired by using the Tha1 technique in 1 patient. In the remaining 3 cases subtotal esophagectomy was performed in association with cervical esophagostomy, ligation of the abdominal esophagus, gastrostomy, and jejunostomy. One patient died of sepsis during the first 24 hours after the operation. The other 3 patients underwent secondary esophagoplasty and survived with no further sign of infection. Mean duration of follow-up in the survivor group was 53 months (range, 15-95 months). Overall 6 patients, including 3 that did not undergo surgical treatment, died and 3 patients survived. Conclusion: Our experience confirms that AEF is a rare but catastrophic disorder. In situ allograft replacement usually in association with subtotal esophagectomy appears to be an excellent salvage modality whenever emergency surgery is feasible.",10.1097/01.sla.0000080828.37493.e0,Web of Science

PATIENTS AND METHODS: As part of a larger study of  the effects of retained lead bullets on blood lead, a retrospective review of  study findings was completed on 5 of 8 patients who sustained injuries to the  maxillofacial region. These 5 patients were recruited into the larger study  within 11 days of injury and showed a penetration path for the projectile that  engaged the upper aerodigestive tract. All subjects were recruited from patients  presenting for care of their gunshot injuries to a large inner-city trauma center  with a retained bullet resulting from a gunshot injury. An initial blood lead  level was measured for all recruited patients and repeated 1 to 17 weeks later.  Medical history was taken along with a screening and risk factor questionnaire to  determine other potential or actual sources (occupational/recreational) of lead  exposure. (109)Cd K-shell x-ray fluorescence determinations of bone lead were  completed to determine past lead exposure not revealed by medical history and  risk factor questionnaire. Radiographs taken of the abdomen and chest, required  as a part of the patient's hospital care, were retrospectively reviewed for signs  of metallic fragments along the aerodigestive tract. RESULTS: All 5 patients  retained multiple lead pellets or fragments at the site of injury, sustained  fractures of the facial bones, and showed increases in blood lead. Three of the 5  study subjects who sustained maxillofacial gunshot injuries involving the mouth,  nose, or throat region showed metallic densities along the gastrointestinal tract  indicative of ingested bullet fragments. Each patient with ingested bullet  fragments showed rapid elevation of blood lead exceeding 25 microg/dL and  sustained increases well beyond the time when all ingested fragments were  eliminated. A 3-year follow-up on these 3 patients showed significantly sustained  elevation of blood lead but less than that observed during the initial 6 months  after injury. None of the 5 study subjects showed any evidence of metallic  foreign bodies within the tracheobronchial regions indicative of aspiration.  CONCLUSION: Ingestion of lead fragments can result from gunshot injuries to the  maxillofacial region and may substantially contribute to a rapid increase in  blood lead level. Prompt diagnosis and elimination of ingested lead fragments are  essential steps necessary to prevent lead being absorbed from the  gastrointestinal tract. Increased blood lead in victims after gunshot injuries  must be fully evaluated for all potential sources, including recent environmental  exposure, absorption of lead from any remaining bullets in body tissues, and the  possibility of mobilization of lead from long-term body stores such as bone.",10.1053/joms.2003.50117,PubMed

Material and Methods: A prospective study was performed on 36 patients (26 F, 10 M, mean age 70 years) with a history of foreign body impaction. All had negative findings at indirect laryngoscopy. Radiologic assessment included unenhanced helical CT and a barium contrast study. Patients with positive findings were taken to esophagoscopy. All patients had a posterior clinical surveillance. Results: Twenty patients had both normal CT and barium study and satisfactory clinical outcome. In 12 patients a foreign body was noted in the cervical esophagus by CT, barium study, and endoscopy. In one patient a fish bone was detected by CT (and not by barium) confirmed with esophagoscopy. Another patient bad a fish bone esophageal perforation which was observed only by CT and confirmed at surgery. Two patients with normal barium and endoscopy presented a false-positive CT result. Conclusion: Barium swallow is currently the first radiologic study, but may involve a risk of aspiration and can impede a subsequent esophagoscopy. Esophagoscopy is an invasive technique with a certain risk of serious complications that can be avoided with a satisfactory radiologic assessment. CT is easy, fast, has 100% sensitivity and is therefore the first choice technique for diagnosing suspected upper esophageal foreign bodies not expected to be visible on plain radiographs.",10.1080/02841850410005516,Web of Science

Children can ingest various foreign objects. One of such objects is safety pin,  which is not widely reported in the literature. The purpose of this study is to  consider the efficacy of Magill forceps for removal of safety pins from upper  esophagus. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted for all children  admitted to our hospital with safety pin ingestion from 1995 to 2003. In 58  children who had been found to ingest safety pin, the attachment site was  gastrointestinal tract. In 12 of the cases, safety pins were located in the upper  end of the esophagus. In seven of the children safety pin extraction was achieved  by using a Magill forceps with the assistance of a laryngoscope maintaining  general anesthesia with mask inhalation. RESULTS: Safety pins were successfully  removed with Magill forceps without any complications in seven patients whom they  were located in the upper esophagus. Upper esophageal safety pins in the other  five patients were extracted with rigid esophagoscopy for they were not seen  under direct laryngoscopy. There were no complications. CONCLUSIONS: This is a  preliminary report, but we believe that the Magill forceps technique for the  removal of safety pin in the upper end of the esophagus is safe and minimally  invasive method compared to rigid esophagoscopy.",10.1016/j.ijporl.2004.04.012,PubMed

Normal  values of this ratio have been established for subjects of different ethnicity,  but the differences between genders and race have not been critically compared.  PURPOSE: To establish normal cervical spinal dimensions and analyze the  differences observed between men and women, and between reports using subjects of  different ethnicity. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Observational. PATIENT SAMPLE: Forty  men and 40 women of Chinese descent with no history or symptoms of neck pathology  selected from patients presenting to the Emergency Department for foreign body  ingestion. OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements of the sagittal developmental diameter  (SDD) and vertebral body diameter (VB) on the lateral cervical radiograph with  calculation of SDD/VB (Torg ratio). METHODS: Lateral radiographs of the cervical  spine were taken in a standardized manner with a 180-cm film-to-tube distance.  Comparison was made between genders in the study population and with previous  reports on subjects of different ethnicity. RESULTS: The SDD was narrowest at the  C4 level in both men and women. Women had smaller SDDs at all levels of the  cervical spine. Female VBs were of sizes similar to their corresponding SDDs,  whereas men had larger VBs. This resulted in small Torg ratios in men averaging  0.87. Comparison with previous reports demonstrated consistent variation in the  SDD, which increased serially from Japanese, through Chinese and Indian, to white  subjects. The relationship of VB to the corresponding SDD displayed wide  variation between reports. This resulted in Torg ratios differing not only  between subjects of different ethnicity but also between genders within the same  population. CONCLUSIONS: The Torg ratio is not a consistent indicator of the SDD  and may not be used to reliably identify the presence of cervical canal stenosis.",10.1016/j.spinee.2003.11.011,PubMed

2005,"Kay, M.","Kay, Marsha; Wyllie, Robert",Current Gastroenterology Reports,Pediatric foreign bodies and their management,"Ingestion of foreign bodies is a common pediatric problem, with more than 100,000 cases occurring each year. The vast majority of pediatric ingestions are  accidental; increasing incidence of intentional ingestions starts in the  adolescent age group. In the United States, the most common pediatric foreign  bodies ingested are coins, followed by a variety of other objects, including  toys, toy parts, sharp objects, batteries, bones, and food. In adolescents and  adults, meat or food impactions are the most common accidental foreign body  ingestion. Esophageal pathology underlies most cases of food impaction.  Management of foreign body ingestions varies based on the object ingested, its  location, and the patient's age and size. Esophageal foreign bodies as a group  require early intervention because of their potential to cause respiratory  symptoms and complications, esophageal erosions, or even an aortoesophageal  fistula. Ingested batteries that lodge in the esophagus require urgent endoscopic  removal even in the asymptomatic patient due to the high risk of complications.  Sharp foreign bodies increase the foreign body complication rate from less than  1% to 15% to 35%, except for straight pins, which usually follow a relatively  benign course unless multiple pins are ingested. Magnets are increasingly  ingested, due to their ubiquitous nature and the perception that they do not pose  a risk. Ingestion of multiple magnets creates a significant risk of obstruction,  perforation, and fistula development. Methods to deal with foreign bodies include  the suture technique, the double snare technique, and the combined forceps/snare  technique for long, large, and sharp foreign bodies, along with newer equipment,  such as retrieval nets and a variety of specialized forceps.",10.1007/s11894-005-0037-6,PubMed

METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed. Patients were identified using  ICD-9 code for esophageal foreign body. Clinical data and management techniques,  along with complications were abstracted. RESULTS: For the 5-year period of  review, 255 patients were identified with an esophageal foreign body. 214  children had a witnessed ingestion. The mean age of the unwitnessed ingestion  group was 2.3 years, compared to 4.6 years for a witnessed ingestion. In both  groups, males and females were distributed equally and the most common ingested  object was a coin. Bivariate, unadjusted analysis revealed that history of wheeze  (OR, 4.35) and fever (OR, 11.15) had the largest association with patients who  had an unwitnessed ingestion. Multivariate analysis indicated that any physical  findings of wheeze, rhonchi, stridor, or retractions were associated  significantly with a diagnosis of an unwitnessed foreign body. Children less than  2 years of age and with a documented fever are also predictive of an unwitnessed  ingestion. Eleven children (4.3%) with esophageal abnormalities were also noted  to have foreign bodies.

The causes of strictures were ingestion of corrosive  agents (n = 3), biopsy-proved squamous cell carcinoma (n = 12), and postsurgical  scarring (n = 1). The mean dysphagia scores at presentation were compared with  those after stent placement by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS:  Stent placement was technically successful in all patients.

Follow-up examinations were performed until fracture healing was  complete (6 to 8 weeks). RESULTS: A single adverse event occurred in 19 patients  (39%) while 4 patients (8%) had more than 1 complication. The most common event  was screw loosening; 29% of patients had at least 1 screw dislodged in the  treatment period. Of the total number of screws placed (229), 15 (6.5%) became  loose, and were equally distributed among the mandible and maxilla. The remaining  complications noted were root fracture, 4% (2 of 49); loosened wires, 6% (3 of  49); screw shear, 2% (1 of 49); malocclusion, 2% (1 of 49); and ingested  hardware, 2% (1 of 49). CONCLUSIONS: Overall the IMF self-drilling/tapping screws  have been shown to be a useful modality to establish maxillomandibular fixation.  It is a safe, and time-sparing technique; however, it is not without limitations  or potential consequences which the surgeon must be aware of in order to provide  safe and effective treatment.",10.1016/j.joms.2007.04.022,PubMed
2007,"Dahshan, A.","Dahshan, Ahmed H.; Kevin Donovan, Gerard",Journal Of Clinical Gastroenterology,Bougienage versus endoscopy for esophageal coin removal in children,"BACKGROUND: Foreign body ingestion is a common pediatric problem. Coins are by far the most common ingested foreign bodies. When ingested coins become lodged in  the esophagus, they may cause serious complications if they are not removed in a  timely manner. Endoscopic removal is the preferred treatment in many pediatric  centers as its safety and effectiveness are well established. OBJECTIVES: We  performed this study to evaluate safety and effectiveness of an alternative  method of managing esophageal coins, using bougienage technique. METHODS:  Previously healthy children presenting to the local emergency room with  uncomplicated, witnessed coin ingestion of less than 24 hours duration were  prospectively recruited with an intent-to-treat analysis. A single oral passage  of a Hurst bougie dilator was performed by a gastroenterologist to dislodge the  esophageal coin into the stomach. If bougienage was successful (x-ray showing  coin in the stomach), patients were discharged and instructions were given for  monitoring stools until passage of the coin through anus was confirmed. If  bougienage was unsuccessful, the child developed symptoms at any time or if a  coin remained intragastric for 4 weeks, endoscopic removal was planned. Children  whose parents declined to participate in the bougienage treatment received the  standard endoscopic removal and their hospital records were used as controls.  RESULTS: A total of 10 children were enrolled in this study, with a mean age of  3.2 years (11 mo to 10 y), 6 boys and 4 girls. All received little or no  sedation. Nine children (90%) were successfully treated using bougienage, all of  whom spontaneously passed the ingested coins, with a mean duration of 2.6 days (1  to 7 d) without subsequent intervention. A single case failed bougienage and  underwent endoscopic removal. Three children declined bougienage treatment and  underwent endoscopic removal. There were no reported minor or major adverse  events with any of our cases. The mean health care cost for the hospital visit  for bougienage treatment was $1210, compared with $3100 for the endoscopic  removal (P<0.001). Furthermore, the mean time spent in the hospital from  diagnosis to discharge was 2 hours for bougienage-treated patients compared with  8 hours for endoscopic treatment (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bougienage of impacted  esophageal coins is an effective, safe, and more economic treatment modality for  selected pediatric patients with uncomplicated coin ingestion. This simple  technique may provide a valuable tool to emergency room physicians or primary  care doctors especially when endoscopy is not readily available.",10.1097/01.mcg.0000225622.09718.5f,PubMed

Part A,Removal of open safety pins in infants by flexible endoscopy is effective and safe,"PURPOSE: In our country, safety pin ingestion by infants is commonplace. When swallowed, open safety pins are mostly found within the esophagus or stomach, and  they cannot be easily removed by rigid esophagogastroscopy. Our aim was to  evaluate the removal of safety pins using flexible endoscopy in infants.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the cases of 7 infants who had ingested open  safety pins between 2001 and 2004. In all the patients, the primary diagnostic  tool was a direct x-ray of the neck, chest, and abdomen. In all cases, the safety  pins were removed by flexible esophagogastroduo-denoscopy. Clinical records for  the cases were reviewed. RESULTS: Four of the open safety pins were lodged in the  esophagus, two in the stomach, and one in the duodenum. One infant had a safety  pin lodged in the esophagus with the pin's open end pointed caudally; the pin was  held with the endoscopic forceps by its tail end and removed. Three safety pins  in the esophagus had their open ends pointing cephalad; these were held by their  tail ends using the endoscopic forceps and pushed into the stomach. Then they  were rotated in the stomach and removed tail end first. The safety pins located  in the stomach or duodenum were also removed similarly. All safety pins were  successfully removed, and there were no operative complications. CONCLUSION: Open  surgery or other invasive removal methods are not necessary in infants with open  safety pin ingestions. In our opinion, the best way to extract an open safety pin  from the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum is by using a flexible endoscopic  device.",10.1089/lap.2006.0060,PubMed

M.; Roig, J.; Farrés, R.",Colorectal Disease : The Official Journal Of The Association Of Coloproctology Of Great Britain And Ireland,Management of foreign bodies in the rectum,"OBJECTIVE: The discovery of foreign bodies (FB) in the rectum is an infrequent clinical problem. Most commonly, FB are introduced through the anal passage or  reach the rectum after oral ingestion. We describe our experience in the  diagnosis and treatment of FB retained in the rectum. METHOD: From 1997 to 2004,  data were collected prospectively in 30 patients (20 men and 10 women; median age  42.5 years). Extraction method, size and type of object, and postextraction  evolution were reviewed. RESULTS: The FB was introduced anally in 16 cases and by  oral ingestion in 14. Principal associated factors were: mental disorder in 11,  penitentiary confinement in two, and drug and alcohol intake in two. Recent  sexual activity had taken place in 14 cases. The size and nature of the FB were  varied. The most frequent symptom was constipation with or without pelvic or anal  discomfort (n = 23, 77%). Treatment consisted of spontaneous ejection (n = 2),  digital extraction with or without enemas (n = 10), digital extraction under  local/regional anaesthesia after fragmentation (n = 11) and regional exploratory  laparotomy under general anaesthesia (n = 7). Grade I rectal trauma was the most  common (n = 23, 77%). Six patients required colostomy. Four patients (13.5%)  suffered complications and none died. Only 17 patients were hospitalized, with a  mean stay of 6 days. All patients recovered without sequelae. CONCLUSION: The  diagnosis of rectal FB should be suspected when faced with low pelvic or perianal  abdominal pain and/or rectal haemorrhage within the context of an unconvincing  story in patients without a history of recent instrumental rectal exploration for  therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. Because of potential complications, FB in the  rectum should be considered a serious condition that must be treated without  delay.",10.1111/j.1463-1318.2006.01184.x,PubMed

Management approaches include endoscopic or open surgical  repair. Unfortunately, these procedures can be complicated by high rates of  recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, tracheal stenosis, recurrent fistula and  significant patient mortality. Thus, several authors have advocated the use of  esophageal rest as conservative management of acquired TEF to permit closure by  secondary intention. This study describes a patient with spontaneous closure of  an acquired TEF following disc-battery ingestion. The late recurrence of the TEF  following conservative management, and endoscopic and radiographic evidence of  closure, illustrates the importance of long term evaluation before assuming  fistula resolution. Practitioners must carefully weigh the risks and benefits  before deciding surgical versus conservative management of TEF.

2008,"Lobmaier, P.","Lobmaier, P; Kornor, H; Kunoe, N; Bjørndal, A",Cochrane Database Of Systematic Reviews,Sustained‐release naltrexone for opioid dependence,"Abstract - Background Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist which effectively blocks heroin effects. Since opioid dependence treatment with naltrexone tablets suffers from high dropout rates, several depot injections and implants are under investigation. Sustained‐release formulations are claimed to be effective, but a systematic review of the literature is lacking. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of sustained‐release naltrexone for opioid dependence and its adverse effects in different study populations. Search methods The following databases were searched from their inception to November 2007: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, trial database at http://clinicaltrials.gov, available NIDA monographs, CPDD and AAAP conference proceedings. The reference lists of identified studies, published reviews and relevant web sides were searched manually. Study authors and drug companies were contacted to obtain any unpublished material or missing data. Selection criteria To evaluate effectiveness only RCTs were included. To evaluate safety, any clinical trial reporting adverse effects was assessed. Treatment condition was extended to include alcohol dependent subjects and healthy volunteers. Data collection and analysis Reviewers independently evaluated the reports, rated methodological quality and extracted data. Analyses were performed separately for opioid dependent, alcohol dependent and healthy participants. Main results Foe effectiveness, one report met inclusion criteria. Two dosages of naltrexone depot injections (192 and 384 mg) were compared to placebo. High‐dose significantly increased days in treatment compared to placebo (WMD 21.00, 95% CI 10.68 to 31.32, p<0.0001). High‐dose compared to low‐dose significantly increased days in treatment (WMD 12.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 22.31, p=0.02). Number of patients retained in treatment did not show significant differences between groups. For adverse effects, seventeen reports met inclusion criteria analyses, six were RCTs. Side effects were significantly more frequent in naltrexone depot groups compared to placebo. In alcohol dependent samples only, adverse effects appeared to be significantly more frequent in the low‐dose naltrexone depot groups compared to placebo (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.36, p=0.02). In the opioid dependent sample, group differences were not statistically significant. Reports on systematic assessment of side effects and adverse events were scarce. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of sustained‐release naltrexone for treatment of opioid dependence.   For naltrexone injections, administration site‐related adverse effects appear to be frequent, but of moderate intensity and time limited. For a harm‐benefit evaluation of naltrexone implants, more data on side effects and adverse events are needed. Plain language summary People with opioid dependence require substantial therapeutic effort to keep them drug free. Their use of illicit opioids can be reduced and retention in treatment improved with supervised agonist replacement therapy with methadone, which is a highly addictive drug. Naltrexone is a long‐acting, opioid‐antagonist that blocks heroin effects. It is used to prevent relapse of both opioid and alcohol dependence. Highly motivated people do best with   naltrexone. Most opioid users are sceptical about treatment with naltrexone tablets and many drop out early on. Dropouts can be reduced with supervised tablet taking, offering incentives and using sustained‐release naltrexone   such as subcutaneous implants or depot injections.   There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of sustained‐release naltrexone. In the one controlled study that met inclusion criteria, 60 outpatients were randomised to one of three groups that received two sequential depot injections of naltrexone (192 or 384 mg) or placebo injections. The mean dropout time was 48 days with high dose naltrexone compared with 27 days on placebo; an increase in   treatment of 21 days (range 11 to 31 days). The lower depot dose gave a lesser benefit. The number retained in treatment at eight weeks did not show a clear difference and ranged from a mean of 68% to 39% of participants in   the different groups. 'Wanting heroin' did not differ on naltrexone but 'needing heroin' scored significantly lower with depot naltrexone compared to placebo. The most prominent adverse effects were general symptoms of   fatigue and pain at the injection site. Seventeen reports met inclusion criteria for assessing adverse effects. Seven looked specifically at naltrexone implants for treatment of opioid dependence and wound infection, allergic reaction to the implant and number of implants removed. The majority of the trials did not have a control group and systematic assessment of adverse effects was lacking.",10.1002/14651858.cd006140.pub2,Cochrane

Body stuffers are street cocaine dealers, who either store wrapped  packets of drugs in their rectum or hastily swallow them, prompted by fear of  police's arrest. These packets can be life threatening in case of leakage. We  evaluate the diagnostic value of unenhanced multidetector CT (MDCT) for detection  of cocaine-filled packets (CFP) ingested by body stuffers in a phantom model.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our phantom simulated normal bowel contents in which a  varying number of true and false CFP were randomly mixed. Both only differ in  radiological density. During 18 different reading sessions, four radiologists  independently evaluated the presence and number of true and false CFP.  Interobserver agreement, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative  predictive value were calculated. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement for detection  of any packets, for visualization of true, and false CFP was good (kappa=0.63,  0.74 and 0.58, respectively). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative  predictive value for detection of any packets was 95.6%, 100%, 100% and 62.5%,  respectively; for visualization of the true CFP 86.5%, 100%, 100% and 77.6%,  respectively; and for the false packets 98.1%, 65%, 88.6% and 87.5%,  respectively. CONCLUSION: Unenhanced MDCT without bowel preparation is a fast,  reliable and easily reproducible imaging modality for the immediate detection of  ingested CFP, thus facilitating medicolegal management of body stuffers.",10.1016/j.ejrad.2007.07.017,PubMed

Feeding and swallowing impairments are key predictors of increased morbidity and mortality in adults with learning disabilities. This postal survey and interview study sought to identify risk factors in adults with learning disabilities who have histories of choking. Method. A total of 2000 questionnaires were sent to carers of all adults with learning disabilities registered as service users by three local health authorities. (A 'service user' may be using any specialist learning disability health or social care facility with day, residential or therapeutic services). Of the 674 service users for whom surveys were returned, 47 were living in hospital, 396 were living in residential or group homes and 208 were living with relatives, or in their own homes. Eighteen subjects who had reported serious or repeated episodes of choking were interviewed in depth in their residences or workplaces. Responses were subjected to frequency analyses. Personal characteristics were analysed. Choking patterns were differentiated by food texture. Results. A total of 34% of questionnaires on 674 service users were returned; 42% of respondents reported one or more choking episodes. There was a significantly greater occurrence of choking among people with more severe learning disability, with Down syndrome, people who had an incomplete dentition or were taking a greater number of psychotropic drugs. Antisocial eating habits learnt in institutional settings presented an additional choking hazard for some individuals. Conclusion. Choking is a serious hazard for many adults with learning disabilities. This study establishes many of the characteristics associated with swallowing problems in this population. Clinicians and carers should benefit from awareness of these predictors, leading to better management of eating behaviours and habits. A choking and swallowing risk assessment should be included in routine health assessments of adults with learning disability, paying especial attention to the condition of a person's teeth; possible side effects from prescribed medication, and abnormal eating behaviour.",10.1080/09638280701461625,Web of Science

Anaesthesiologists would be more and more confronted to patient with tattooing or piercing, or both.  This review discusses the anaesthetic potential risks and complications observed  with tattooing and piercing, their management and prevention. RECENT FINDINGS:  Airway management during anaesthesia is of particular interest with oral jewelry.  Patients often refuse to remove their piercing for fear of tract closure. There  are no serious complications reported after epidural puncture through a tattoo,  although any long-term consequence cannot be discarded yet. Even theoretical  concerns are more and more debated. SUMMARY: Oral and nasal piercing is of  particular concern because of the risks of swallowing and aspiration.  Consequently, patients should be advised to remove piercing before anaesthesia.  Emergency situations are especially risky and anaesthesiologists should be aware  of the piercing removal techniques. In case of piercing loss, radiographies and  fiberoptic endoscopy of the upper airways and digestive tracts should be  performed to eliminate aspiration or swallowing of the foreign body. Epidurals  should not be denied to parturients with lumbar tattooing. However, it seems  still prudent to avoid direct tattoo puncture or when unavoidable, to nick the  skin prior to inserting the needle through the tattoo.",10.1097/aco.0b013e32832a4125,PubMed

OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics and management  of foreign-body ingestions, with predominantly intentional ingestion, in a lower  socioeconomic status population. DESIGN: A retrospective case series. SETTING: An  urban county hospital. PATIENTS: Patients >/=17 years old, with foreign-body  ingestions between 2000 and 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Characteristics of  ingestion cases, endoscopic extraction, need for surgery, and complications.  RESULTS: Among 262 cases, 92% were intentional, 85% involved psychiatric  patients, and 84% occurred in patients with prior ingestions. The time from  ingestion to presentation was >48 hours in 168 cases (64%). The overall success  rate for endoscopic extraction was 90% (165/183 cases). Surgery was performed in  30 cases (11%) and was more common for objects beyond the pylorus versus objects  above the pylorus (16/43 [37%] vs 10/151 [7%], respectively) and in cases with a  greater delay from ingestion to presentation (25/168 [15%] if >48 hours vs 4/77  [5%] if </=48 hours) and from presentation to intervention (15/40 [38%] if >48  hours vs 14/165 [8%] if </=48 hours). Perforation occurred in 16 cases (6%), with  6 perforations noted after endoscopy. LIMITATION: A retrospective review of  medical records. CONCLUSIONS: Foreign-body ingestions in an urban county hospital  occurred primarily in psychiatric patients who had repeated episodes of  intentional ingestions. Endoscopic extraction was unsuccessful in 10% of cases.  Long delays from ingestion to presentation and intervention may account for  relatively high rates of surgery and perforation.

2009,"Schrom, T.","Schrom, T.; Amm, S.",Laryngo- Rhino- Otologie,Unusual case of oesophageal foreign body as part of a self-harm syndrome,"INTRODUCTION: Foreign bodies in the oesophagus represent a frequent emergency situation in ENT medicine. Usually the cases involve lumps of meat, bones, shards  of glass, bottle tops, batteries or dentures. We would like to report about an  unusual foreign body found in the oesophagus. PATIENT: A 45-year-old patient  presented himself in our interdisciplinary casualty department where he claimed  to have swallowed a butter-knife that morning as a bet. The ENT examination  showed no abnormal findings. The thorax X-Ray revealed a 14 cm-long foreign body  in projection to the oesophagus, which matched the knife. Following consultation  with the thorax surgeon, a rigid oesophagoscopy was conducted under endotracheal  intubation and the knife was easily removed using tongs. Archive searches  conducted in the meantime showed that foreign bodies had been removed from the  patient on numerous occasions by fellow surgeons either laparoscopically or via  open surgery. As a result, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric ward  with unimpeded swallowing reflex with a suspected self-harming syndrome.  DISCUSSION: As an ENT emergency, a foreign body in the oesophagus generally  requires intervention because of the risk of complications such as perforation or  pressure-induced necrosis of the oesophagus wall with resulting mediastinitis.  Suitable instruments are the flexible oesophagoscope, the rigid oesophagoscope  under anaesthesia or transcervical/transthoracic removal. The choice of procedure  crucially depends on the type and localisation of the foreign body in the  oesophagus. Particularly in cases of unusual foreign objects or repeated foreign  object ingestion, it should be considered whether a psychological illness could  be the cause and whether the introduction of appropriate therapy could be  expedient.",10.1055/s-0028-1100381,PubMed

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose is to identify  the number of inadvertent ingestions of beverage-can stay-tabs by children  recognized at our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical information  system of a children's hospital was searched with key terms to identify cases in  which a witnessed or self-reported inadvertent ingestion of a beverage-can  stay-tab resulted in a radiograph to rule out presence of a foreign body.  Demographics, identification of stay-tab on radiographs, associated  abnormalities, and patient management were reviewed. RESULTS: Nineteen cases of  stay-tab ingestion were identified over 16 years. Mean age of ingesters was 8.5  years with the majority being teenagers and 15 (79%) >5 years of age. The  stay-tab could be seen radiographically only in 4 (21%) cases-all with the  stay-tab identified in the stomach.

We studied the poorly  understood group of patients who intentionally ingest FBs. METHODS: Cases of  intentional ingestion of FBs (n = 305) were identified, retrospectively, from an  electronic endoscopy database and followed. Cases occurred among 33 different  patients, who underwent endoscopy from October 1, 2001, to July 31, 2009 (39.0  cases/year); 79% were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. Financial cost  analysis was performed using hospital billing and cost systems. RESULTS: Commonly  ingested FBs included pens (23.6%), batteries (9.2%), knives (7.2%), and razor  blades (6.9%). Most endoscopic procedures were performed under general  anesthesia. FBs were commonly retrieved by snares (58.0%), rat-toothed forceps  (14.4%), and nets (11.5%), assisted sometimes by use of overtubes (10.8%), and  hoods (4.6%). FB extraction was unsuccessful at the initial endoscopy in only 20  cases; 2 cases eventually required surgical extraction. Minor complications  occurred in 11 endoscopies. There were no deaths or perforations. The total  estimated costs were $2,018,073 ($1,500,627 in hospital costs, $240,640 in  physician fees, and $276,806 for security services). Costs were significantly  higher for inpatients. Major payers were Medicare (48%) and Medicaid (31%).  CONCLUSIONS: Intentional FB ingestion occurs among a relatively small number of  patients with psychiatric disorders and is costly. Endoscopic retrieval is  relatively effective and safe, but often requires general anesthesia. These cases  utilize significant hospital and fiscal resources.

The symptoms tend  to be non-specific although some patients are able to delineate where the  discomfort level is, correlating with the site of impaction. Most foreign bodies  pass spontaneously; however when multiple sharp objects are ingested, the  gastroenterologist should perform endoscopic procedures to minimize the risks of  bowel perforation.

Current literature lacks good  data documenting long-term outcomes in children. This makes it difficult to  counsel some patients about realistic treatment expectations. The objective of  this study is to evaluate our institutional experience and define the natural  history and treatment outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective review of clinical data  obtained from children who underwent dilation for PS was performed. RESULTS: Over  the past 30 years, 114 children and adolescents received 486 dilations. The most  common indications for stricture dilation were PS (42%) and esophageal atresia  (38%). Other lesser indications included congenital, foreign body, corrosive,  cancer, radiation, allergic, and infectious. This review focuses on the 48  children with PS. Of the children with PS, a congenital anomaly was identified in  23 children; and 12 had neurologic impairment. Average age at presentation was  10.2 years (range, 0.5-18.3 years). Most patients had had symptoms for many  months before diagnosis. Peptic stricture was most common in the lower esophagus  (n = 39). However, middle (n = 8) and upper (n = 1) strictures were occasionally  identified. Noncompliance with medical therapy was a challenge in 12% (n = 5) of  children. Children with a PS received a median of 3 dilations, but a subset of 5  patients with severe strictures underwent up to 48 dilations (range, 1-48).  Repeated dilations were required for a median of 20 months (range, 1-242 months).  Among patients receiving esophageal dilation for PS, 94% required an antireflux  procedure (19% required a second antireflux surgery). A subgroup of patients (n =  10) was identified who required extended dilations, multiple surgeries, and  esophageal resection. This subgroup had a significantly longer period of  symptomatic disease and increased risk of esophageal resection compared with  those patients requiring fewer dilations. Surgical resection of the esophageal  stricture was ultimately required in 3 children with PS after failure of more  conservative measures. CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents presenting with  reflux esophageal stricture (PS) frequently require antireflux surgery, redo  antireflux surgery, and multiple dilations for recurrent symptoms. We hope that  these data will be of use to the clinician attempting to counsel patients and  parents about treatment expectations in this challenging patient population.",10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2010.08.033,PubMed

Although it does not carry the same risk as mercury vapour inhalation, it may cause destructive early and late reactions. Case Presentation: Herein we present the case of a 29-year-old male patient who developed an obsessive-compulsive disorder causing auto-aggressive behaviour with injection of elemental mercury and several other foreign bodies into the soft tissues around the left knee about 15 years before initial presentation. For clinical examination X-rays and a CT-scan of the affected area were performed. Furthermore, blood was taken to determine the mercury concentration in the blood, which showed a concentration 17-fold higher than recommended. As a consequence, the mercury depots and several foreign bodies were resected marginally. Conclusion: Blood levels of mercury will decrease rapidly following surgery, especially in combination with chelating therapy. In case of subcutaneous and intramuscular injection of metallic mercury we recommend marginal or wide excision of all contaminated tissue to prevent migration of mercury and chronic inflammation.

However, the experience in the pediatric population is  limited. Minimally invasive esophagectomy represents a new alternative technique  to the conventional open approach. We wish to report our small case series of  minimally invasive esophagectomy and gastric pull-up in pediatric patients. The  aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of the  procedure. METHODS: Three patients (2 girls and 1 boy) with average age 46 months  (34-57 months) and average weight 12.6 kg (11-15 kg) underwent the procedure. The  indications for esophagectomy were esophageal stricture from caustic ingestion (2  patients) and failed repair of esophageal atresia (1 patient). RESULTS: Average  operative time was 7 h (0519-0752 hours). There were no intraoperative  complications with the average blood loss of 50 cc (5-125 cc). No anastomotic  leaks were noted on the initial esophagrams that were obtained on postoperative  day five or six. One patient developed a cervical wound infection on  postoperative day seven due to a retained piece of Penrose, which required a neck  exploration, removal of foreign body and repair of a small leak. One patient  developed an anastomotic stricture at the 7-month follow-up. She was successfully  treated with two balloon dilatations. One patient developed a delayed  esophagogastric anastomotic leak at 3 months. The leak spontaneously closed after  surgical drainage. At average of 22-month follow-up (15-36 months), all patients  were eating regular food with excellent weight gain. CONCLUSION: Minimally  invasive esophagectomy and gastric pull-up is technically challenging but  feasible and safe with acceptable outcomes.

The most common lodged foreign body, requiring operative removal,  in the United States is the penny. Valued at 1 cent, comprised of materials  valued at less than 1 cent, costing 1.62 cents to manufacture, and being never  removed from circulation, pennies are aplenty. But ingestion can lead to mucosal  damage, the consequences of which can be esophageal perforation or stricture  formation. We hypothesize that the monetary value of the penny is far less than  the cost of its ingestion and removal. This quality assurance study examines the  effect of the penny on the purse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective review  identified 180 foreign bodies in children under the age of 18 over a five year  period. Eighty-two were pennies. Operative notes revealed degree of injury.  Hospital charge assessments revealed the ""cost"" of each visit. RESULTS: There  were no esophageal perforations, and cases were divided evenly among injury  grades 0-III. The average total charge for all penny-related injuries was  $7164.78. CONCLUSIONS: The purpose was to examine the actual cost of a penny  (more than its value in production) and the potential cost of its damage  (thousands of dollars in measurable costs, untold immeasurable costs).

METHODS:  The medical records of 249 patients who ingested FBs were reviewed. In addition,  they were studied by telephone questionnaires to follow up spontaneously passed  FB. The factors associated with SP such as age, the type, size, and initial  location of the FBs were analyzed. RESULTS: Foreign bodies were spontaneously  passed in 145 patients (58.2%), endoscopic removal was performed in 100 patients  (40.2%), and operative removal was performed in 4 patients (1.6%). Most SP FBs  were passed within 5 days. The SP rates (SPRs) according to the initial location  were the following: 12.2% for the esophagus (P<0.0001), 71.4% for the stomach,  85.7% for the small bowel, and 96.4% for the colon. There was no significant  difference in the SPR according to age. When coins and disk batteries that  required early endoscopic removal were excluded, the SPR was 63.4% for FBs less  than 10 mm, 80.4% for FBs 10 to 20 mm, 72.8% for FBs 20 to 30 mm, and 50.0% for  FBs more than 30 mm (P=0.091).

It frequently causes some degree of discomfort to the patient. Various different topical agents, which are intended to reduce this discomfort, are in common use. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of the various agents. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of topical preparations used to reduce discomfort and facilitate NPL in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 14 April 2010. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) looking at the effect of topical anaesthetic or vasoconstrictor agents used reduce discomfort and facilitate NPL in adult patients. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for further information where necessary. The primary outcome measured was pain/discomfort. Secondary outcomes that were looked at included side effects of the topical medications, ease of the procedure and the quality of the view from the operator's perspective. Main results We included eight RCTs (746 participants) in the review. The risk of bias in the studies was generally low. Five studies did not demonstrate any advantage in using a topical treatment prior to endoscopy. One study suggested that a vasoconstrictor alone should be used to reduce the general level of unpleasantness. Two studies did not compare treatment against placebo or no treatment, so it was not possible to draw meaningful conclusions from them. There may be some unpleasant side effects from the use of topical preparations, such as unpleasant taste. There was variation in the format of the outcome data and a lack of complete data; none of the included studies reported their results in a way that would allow pooling and we could not therefore perform meta‐analysis. Authors' conclusions The included studies do not demonstrate any evidence to support the use of topical treatments prior to the use of a fibre‐optic nasal endoscope. Some go as far as to suggest that these agents should not be used due to cost and unpleasant side effects. Five studies did not demonstrate any advantage in terms of reducing pain or discomfort when using a topical treatment prior to endoscopy. The absence of demonstrable effect may be due to relatively small patient groups. It is therefore possible that there is a small effect of using these sprays. Further research using standardised reporting methods is needed. Plain language summary Topical anaesthetic or vasoconstrictor (blood vessel narrowing) preparations for flexible fibre‐optic nasal pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy Topical medications are often applied to the inside of a patient's nose prior to examining the nose, sinuses and throat with a flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscope. The aim of this is to reduce any discomfort the patient may feel and also to improve the adequacy of the examination. Types of preparation include lidocaine, phenylephrine and lidocaine, oxymetazoline, xylometazoline and cocaine and they are usually administered as a spray, although they may also be in the form of a solution which can be applied to cotton wool and placed in the nasal cavity, or as gels, pastes or creams. We looked for randomised controlled trials comparing any of these topical treatments with placebo, no treatment or another topical treatment in adult patients undergoing nasal pharyngolaryngoscopy (NPL). We included eight studies in the review (with a total of 746 patients). It was not possible to combine data from any of the studies, therefore we assessed the individual study results. Five of the studies did not demonstrate any advantage, in terms of reducing pain or discomfort, of using a topical treatment prior to endoscopy. One of these suggested that a vasoconstrictor (xylometazoline) alone reduced the level of ""general unpleasantness"". Two studies did not compare the treatment against placebo or no treatment. A final study actually suggested an increase in pain with the use of topical agents. There may be some unpleasant side effects from the use of topical preparations, such as unpleasant taste. Further standardised research is required.",10.1002/14651858.cd005606.pub2,Cochrane

Therefore, it is important that radiologists be aware of this commonly encountered entity. Attempted suicide may take a variety of forms; those discussed by the authors include sharp force injury, immolation and inhalation, ingestion, hanging, firearm use, jumping from a height, and drowning. Certain radiologic findings are commonly seen in cases of attempted suicide and other self-injurious behaviors. In some cases, especially when the patient is unconscious or is unwilling to provide a history, it may not be apparent that suicide has been attempted until characteristic imaging findings are recognized. Correct identification of suicide attempts on the basis of such findings will ensure that these patients receive appropriate psychiatric treatment. When a suicide attempt is unsuccessful, it is important to be familiar with the complications that may contribute to delayed mortality and morbidity. The radiologist plays an integral role in the acute medical or surgical management of patients who have attempted suicide. In addition, imaging examinations may provide useful forensic information.

The aim of this survey was to collect data on experience  and opinions on the management of FBs in psychiatric patients with BPD and to  review the relevant literature. METHODS: A survey focusing on the indication and  the timing of endoscopy for sharp FB removal in patients with BPD was e-mailed to  215 gastroenterologists, psychiatrists, and surgeons in Switzerland, Germany and  Austria, discussing this clinical problem using a specific case vignette.  RESULTS: Responses were received from 63 of 215 (29%) contacted physicians.  Two-thirds of the respondents knew patients with BPD who had swallowed FBs  repeatedly; 86% recommended removing sharp FBs endoscopically even in the case of  repeated FB ingestion and 14% of respondents argued against emergent endoscopic  FB removal in the case of repeated ingestions. Different specialities expressed  partially divergent opinions regarding the management of these patients.  CONCLUSION: Repeated FB ingestions can be a problem in patients with BPD.  Although published data show that the perforation risk of unremoved FBs is low,  most clinicians support repeated endoscopies also in the case of repeated FB  ingestions. Nevertheless, in selected cases, repeated endoscopies need to be  discussed and an interdisciplinary consensus and/or the involvement of an ethical  committee is advised.",10.1097/meg.0b013e32835403d5,PubMed

The purpose of this study is to utilize a comprehensive database to  describe the epidemiology of pediatric injuries at a tertiary hospital in Malawi.  METHODS: Data were prospectively collected on patients presenting to the  emergency department for treatment of injuries from 2008 to 2010 (n = 23,625).  The subset of pediatric patients (n = 7233) underwent cross-sectional analysis to  examine demographics, injury environment, timing and mechanisms. RESULTS:  Pediatric patients, (0-16 years) comprised 30.6% of all trauma patients. Mean age  was 7.2 years. Falls were the most common injury (43%), followed by burns  (11.1%), pedestrian road traffic injuries (9.7%), foreign bodies (7.5%), and  assaults (7.2%).

Speech and language therapy forms the initial mainstay of management in cases of UVFP, since up to 60% of cases will resolve spontaneously. If vocal fold paralysis persists surgery, in the form of injection medialisation, has been shown to be an effective intervention. What is currently unclear is which is the most effective material available for injection. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of alternative injection materials in the treatment of UVFP. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 23 March 2012. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of injectable materials in patients with UVFP. The outcomes of interest were patient and clinician‐reported improvement, and adverse events. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies from the search results and extracted data. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess study quality. Main results We identified no RCTs which met the inclusion criteria for this review. We excluded 18 studies on methodological grounds: 16 non‐randomised studies; one RCT due to inadequate randomisation and inclusion of non‐UVFP patients; and one RCT which compared two different particle sizes of the same injectable material. Authors' conclusions There is currently insufficient high‐quality evidence for, or against, specific injectable materials for patients with UVFP. Future RCTs should aim to provide a direct comparison of the alternative materials currently available for injection medialisation. Plain language summary Alternative materials injected into the vocal fold (cord) for unilateral vocal fold paralysis Paralysis of one of the vocal folds (vocal cords) can have a significant impact upon a patient's quality of life. The affected patient may suffer with poor voice, breathlessness and problems with their swallowing. The treatment options include voice therapy, injection to the vocal cord or open surgery. The injection of a material into the affected vocal fold aims to improve voice, breathlessness and prevent episodes of aspiration (choking). There are a wide variety of injectable materials available and this review aimed to assess their effectiveness. Our systematic review of the relevant literature could not identify any randomised controlled trials of sufficient quality to include in this review. There is currently insufficient high‐quality evidence to support the effectiveness of any particular injectable material. Further, well‐designed, robust research is required in this area.",10.1002/14651858.cd009239.pub2,Cochrane

The purpose of this study is to determine the minimal, optimal  volume of local anesthetic required for successful ultrasound-guided SGB and to  reduce its adverse effects. METHODS:  Thirty-five patients with postherpetic  neuralgia and complex regional pain syndrome of the upper extremity and the  facial area were selected. For ultrasound-guided SGB by subfacial method, each  patient was injected with 0.5% mepivacaine mixed with contrast media in 2 mL,  3 mL, and 4 mL doses at 2-week intervals. After the procedure, the spread of  contrast media in the spine was checked by fluoroscopy. Ptosis and conjunctival  flushing were rated and recorded. Adverse effects, such as hoarseness, foreign  body sensation, swallowing difficulty, and upper arm weakness, were also  recorded. RESULTS:  Out of the 35 initial patients, the results for 33 patients  who received all three SGBs were included in this study. The contrast media  spread to 4.80 ± 0.82, 4.94 ± 0.86, and 5.09 ± 0.97 total spinal segments in the  2 mL, 3 mL, and 4 mL groups, respectively. The cephalad spread of contrast media  was 2.16 ± 0.74, 2.23 ± 0.85, and 2.30 ± 0.78 spinal segments for the 2 mL, 3 mL,  and 4 mL groups, respectively, and the caudad spread of contrast media was  2.64 ± 0.51, 2.70 ± 0.61, and 2.89 ± 0.64 segments in the 2 mL, 3 mL, and 4 mL  groups, respectively.

Presenting  symptoms, clinical examination, and laboratory findings can guide selection of  diagnostic imaging. RECENT FINDINGS: Intussusception and intestinal malrotation  are potentially serious causes of intestinal obstruction, which are best  evaluated by ultrasound and upper gastrointestinal series, respectively.  Ultrasound has diagnostic importance in the evaluation of multiple diseases,  including appendicitis, by potentially decreasing the need for inpatient  observation, cholecystitis and complications of gall stones such as pancreatitis,  and ovarian diseases. Pelvic inflammatory disease should be considered in  evaluation of a teenage girl with lower abdominal pain. Less common causes of  acute abdominal pain include ingested foreign bodies, infected congenital  anomalies, and perforated peptic ulcer disease. SUMMARY: Presenting symptoms and  physical examination findings can narrow the number of potential diagnoses in  pediatric acute abdominal pain and thereby guide diagnostic imaging selection.  Abdominal/pelvic ultrasound, rather than computed tomography scan, is the  preferred modality for initial evaluation of many potential causes of pediatric  abdominal pain.",10.1097/mop.0b013e328352704e,PubMed

Methods: The present study uses data provided by the SUSY Safe Project, a DG SANCO co-funded project started in February 2005, which was aimed at establishing an international registry of cases of Foreign Bodies (FB) injuries in children aged 0-14 years. The analysis was carried out on injuries due to a food item. FB location was reported according to ICD9-CM code: ears (ICD931). nose (ICD932), pharynx and larynx (ICD933) trachea, bronchi and lungs (ICD934), mouth, esophagus and stomach (ICD935). Age and gender injury distributions were assessed. Data regarding adult supervision and activity before injury were also evaluated. FBs which most frequently cause complications were identified. The association between children age, adult presence, object characteristics and hospitalization/complications was computed using unweighted odds ratios and the related 95% confidence intervals. Results: 16,878 FB injuries occurred in children aged 0-14 years have been recorded in the SUSY Safe databases. FB type was specified in 10,564 cases; among them 2744(26%) were due to a food item. FB site was recorded in 1344 cases: FB was located in the ears in 99 patients, while 1140 occurred in the upper and lower respiratory tract; finally, 105 food items were removed from mouth, esophagus and stomach. Complications occurred in 176 cases and the most documented was pulmonary or bronchial infections (23%) followed emphysema or atelectasis and by and asthma (7%). Bones were the commonest retrieved FFB encountered in this study, while nuts seem to be the FFB most frequently associated to complications. Conclusions: On the basis of this study we make the strong recommendation that parents should be adequately educated and provide age-appropriate food to their children and be present in order to supervise them during eating especially during a critical period ranging from 2 to 3 years of age.

This study was undertaken in order to better define  clinical patterns of IIFO among prisoners. We sought to determine factors  associated with the need for endoscopic and surgical therapy for IIFO. METHODS:  After obtaining permission to conduct IIFO research in incarcerated populations,  study patients were identified by ICD-9 codes. Patient charts were reviewed for  demographics; past medical history; IIFO characteristics; and diagnostic,  endoscopic, and surgical findings. Univariate and multivariate analyses were  performed using statistical software. RESULTS: Thirty patients with 141 episodes  of IIFO were identified. The mean number of ingested items per episode was 4.60.  Endoscopy was performed in 97 of 141 IIFO instances, with failure to retrieve the  ingested object in 21 of 97 cases (22%). Eleven instances (7.8%) required  surgical intervention. On multivariate analyses, hospital admission was  associated with elevated white blood cell count (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, P < 0.05)  and number of items ingested (OR 1.3, P < 0.05). The need for endoscopy was  independently associated with ingestion of multiple objects (OR 3.3, P < 0.05)  and elevated white blood cell count (OR 1.3, P < 0.05).

2013,"Fitzgerald, K.","Fitzgerald, Kevin T.; Bronstein, Alvin C.",Topics In Companion Animal Medicine,Polyurethane adhesive ingestion,"Polyurethane adhesives are found in a large number of household products in the United States and are used for a variety of purposes. Several brands of these  expanding wood glues (those containing diphenylmethane diisocyanate [MDI]) have  the potential to form gastrointestinal (GI) foreign bodies if ingested. The  ingested adhesive forms an expanding ball of glue in the esophagus and gastric  lumen. This expansion is caused by a polymerization reaction using the heat,  water, and gastric acids of the stomach. A firm mass is created that can be 4-8  times its original volume. As little as 2 oz of glue have been reported to  develop gastric foreign bodies. The obstructive mass is reported to form within  minutes of ingestion of the adhesive. The foreign body can lead to esophageal  impaction and obstruction, airway obstruction, gastric outflow obstruction,  mucosal hemorrhage, ulceration, laceration, perforation of the esophageal and  gastric linings, and death. Clinical signs following ingestion include anorexia,  lethargy, vomiting, tachypnea, and abdominal distention and pain, and typically  develop within 12 hours. Clinical signs may depend upon the size of the mass. If  left untreated, perforation and rupture of the esophagus or stomach can occur.  The glue mass does not stick to the GI mucosa and is not always detectable on  abdominal palpation. Radiographs are recommended to confirm the presence of the  ""glue-ball"" foreign body, and radiographic evidence of the obstruction may be  seen as early as 4-6 hours following ingestion. Emesis is contraindicated owing  to the risk of aspiration of the glue into the respiratory tree or the subsequent  lodging of the expanding glue mass in the esophagus. Likewise, efforts to dilute  the glue and prevent the formation of the foreign body through administration of  liquids, activated charcoal, or bulk-forming products to push the foreign body  through the GI tract have proven ineffective. Even endoscopy performed to remove  the foreign body has been shown to be unreliable. The safest, most effective, and  successful therapy is surgical intervention to remove the GI foreign body. If  performed early enough, complete recovery of the animal can be expected.  Differential diagnoses for polyurethane adhesive ingestion include any potential  cause of GI obstruction. The public is largely unaware of the hazards that  ingestion of this product may produce. Public education efforts are needed to  inform pet owners about the hazards of these glues and the overall importance of  providing our companion animals with safe, poison-free environments.",10.1053/j.tcam.2013.03.007,PubMed

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with a history of sharp or  pointed foreign body ingestion were reviewed retrospectively. Two observers  interpreted the CT and the conventional radiography datasets separately. If a  foreign body was directly identified, it was regarded as a positive finding. Even  if no high-density foreign body was found, detection of a secondary finding was  considered to be a positive finding. Diagnostic performance of MDCT and  conventional radiography were compared according to esophageal level. Final  diagnosis was made by esophagoscopy or surgery in addition to the  clinicoradiologic result. RESULTS: MDCT was statistically superior to  conventional radiography for diagnosis of a thoracic esophageal foreign body for  both observers (p < 0.001 for each). No significant difference in sensitivity  between CT and conventional radiography for diagnosis of cervical esophageal  foreign body was noted regardless of observer. Both observers could identify all  complicated conditions with MDCT regardless of esophageal level. However, in two  of three cases of complicated thoracic esophageal foreign bodies, neither  observer could detect foreign bodies on conventional radiography; furthermore,  the observers could not identify pneumomediastinum.

Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 28 February 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 28 February 2013), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 28 February 2013),  meta Register of Controlled Trials (to 7 April 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (to 7 April 2013) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 7 April 2013). The reference lists of all trials identified were checked for further studies. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials evaluating the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. Any studies that compared different treatment approaches were included. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Results were to be expressed as random‐effects models using mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was to be investigated to include both clinical and methodological factors. Main results Twelve studies, assessed as high (six) and unclear (six) risk of bias, comprising 689 participants (830 fractures), were included. Interventions examined different plate materials and morphology; use of one or two lag screws; microplate versus miniplate; early and delayed mobilization; eyelet wires versus Rapid IMF™ and the management of angle fractures with intraoral access alone or combined with a transbuccal approach. Patient‐oriented outcomes were largely ignored and post‐operative pain scores were inadequately reported. Unfortunately, only one or two trials with small sample sizes were conducted for each comparison and outcome. Our results and conclusions should therefore be interpreted with caution. We were able to pool the results for two comparisons assessing one outcome. Pooled data from two studies comparing two miniplates versus one miniplate revealed no significant difference in the risk of post‐operative infection of surgical site (risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95% CI 0.41 to 4.22, P = 0.64, I 2  = 0%). Similarly, no difference in post‐operative infection between the use of two 3‐dimensional (3D) and standard (2D) miniplates was determined (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.19 to 8.13, P = 0.81, I 2  = 27%). The included studies involved a small number of participants with a low number of events. Authors' conclusions This review illustrates that there is currently inadequate evidence to support the effectiveness of a single approach in the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. The lack of high quality evidence may be explained by clinical diversity, variability in assessment tools used and difficulty in grading outcomes with existing measurement tools. Until high level evidence is available, treatment decisions should continue to be based on the clinician's prior experience and the individual circumstances. Plain language summary Treatments for fractures of the lower jaw Review question The lower jaw (also known as the mandible) is an important bone that shapes the face, holds the lower teeth in place and is used to move the mouth, for talking and chewing food. Fractures are most often found in the part of the lower jaw that supports teeth (known as the body), the part where the jaw curves upwards into the neck (the angle), or at the knobbly‐shaped joint found at the very top of the jaw bone (the condyle). Available treatments align and stabilize the fracture, allowing the bone to heal in the proper position. Treatments may or may not involve surgery. This review, produced by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, examines different methods for treating fractures of the body and angle of the mandible in existing research and studies. Background People of all ages can fracture their lower jaw, but fractures mainly occur as a result of violence (for example, being hit or punched in the jaw) or by being involved in an accident on the road (for example, car crashes or bicycle accidents). These fractures can be stabilized by physically binding the jaw shut with a system of bars, wires or elastic bands (intermaxillary fixation), or by using tiny screws or plates attached directly to the fractured sections of the lower jaw bone whilst still allowing the mouth to open (rigid fixation). Study characteristics The evidence on which this review is based is up to date as of 28 February 2013. Twelve studies with a combined total of 689 participants were included in this review. Participants ranged in age from 16 to 68 years and most participants (90%) were male. All of the studies compared different types of surgical treatments, and each study evaluated a different aspect of surgical treatment such as different types of plates, screws, or wires or how long the jaw was immobilized after surgery. Key results There were concerns about the design and quality of all the studies. All the studies evaluated different aspects of surgical treatment. None of the studies evaluated non‐surgical treatments such as intermaxillary fixation and no study compared surgical treatment with non‐surgical treatment. As a result there is no clear evidence to indicate which approach is the best to manage these fractures. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence found is poor. Recommendations are made for further well‐conducted research studies in this area to be undertaken.",10.1002/14651858.cd006087.pub3,Cochrane

Stylohyoid complex ossification (SCO) can be associated with temporomandibular disorder (TMD). However, this subject is poorly investigated in epidemiological studies. Purpose. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between TMD and SCO. Material and methods. Seventy-eight individuals with TMD and 93 control individuals without TMD were enrolled in a case-control study and paired according to age and gender. Panoramic radiographs were made of all participants, and SCO was measured in millimeters (mm) by a blinded researcher. Ossification was held to begin at measurements of 30 mm or more. The association between symptoms (pain upon swallowing or turning the head and the sensation of a foreign body in the throat) and SCO was investigated. Pearson chi-square tests were used for the comparison of proportions, (alpha=.05). Results. A total of 44.9% of those with TMD and 46.2% of the control population exhibited SCO (P=.858). TMD was associated with pain upon swallowing (P<.05) and upon turning the head P<.01), but there were no associations between the symptoms possibly related to SCO and the presence of ossification (pain upon swallowing P=.658; sensation of a foreign body in the throat P=.980; pain upon turning the head P=.405). Conclusions. The results suggest that there are no associations between TMD and SCO. Some symptoms classically associated with SCO also occur in TMD patients.

They are frequently inadvertently placed by children in their ears or noses and  occasionally are swallowed and lodged along the upper aerodigestive tract. The  purpose of this work is to study the different presentations of button battery  foreign bodies and present our experience in the diagnosis and management of this  hazardous problem in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 13  patients. The diagnostic protocol was comprised of a thorough history, head and  neck physical examination, and appropriate radiographic evaluation. The button  batteries were emergently extracted under general anesthesia. RESULTS: The  average follow-up period was 4.3 months. Five patients had a nasal button  battery. Four patients had an esophageal button battery. Three patients had a  button battery in the stomach. One patient had a button battery impacted in the  left external ear canal. Apart from a nasal septal perforation and a tympanic  membrane perforation, no major complications were detected. CONCLUSION: Early  detection is the key in the management of button battery foreign bodies. They  have a distinctive appearance on radiography, and its prompt removal is  mandatory, especially for batteries lodged in the esophagus. Physicians must  recognize the hazardous potential and serious implications of such an accident.  There is a need for more public education about this serious problem.",10.1155/2013/846091,PubMed

Intentional overdose  of potassium supplements is an uncommon occurrence. OBJECTIVE: This case  illustrates a novel approach to treatment of pharmacobezoar with  esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and demonstrates its effectiveness in the  setting of extended-release potassium chloride overdose. CASE REPORT: A  44-year-old female presented to the ED with intentional ingestion of an unknown  amount of extended-release potassium chloride (K-Dur®) tablets and alprazolam  (Xanax®). The patient's serum potassium was initially 7.3 mmol/L and she was  treated with standard treatments, including albuterol, calcium gluconate,  insulin, dextrose, and sodium bicarbonate. Radiographic investigation showed a  pharmacobezoar in the gastric fundus. Treatment was then augmented with whole  bowel irrigation (WBI) using polyethylene glycol solution via nasogastric tube.  Patient did not tolerate the nasogastric tube, became combative with increasing  alteration in her level of consciousness, and WBI therapy was stopped. After  discussion with the gastroenterologist, the patient was treated with EGD to  remove the pharmacobezoar. The EGD was successful in the removal of the  pharmacobezoar and the patient's potassium normalized without complications.  CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that in cases of suspected or confirmed potassium drug  bezoar in the stomach, physicians consider EGD for removal. This allows for  normalization of potassium level while preventing adverse sequelae.",10.1016/j.jemermed.2013.08.031,PubMed

Body packers either swallow drug-filled packets or introduce drug-filled packets into their bodies rectally or vaginally with the purpose of concealing them. The three main smuggled drugs are cocaine, heroin and cannabis products. Body packing represents a serious risk of acute narcotic toxicity from drug exposure, intestinal obstruction owing to pellet impaction and bowel perforation with consequent abdominal sepsis. A suspected body packer is generally admitted to hospital to perform imaging investigations and confirm the presence of drugs in his/her body. Radiological imaging methods are essential to diagnose body packing and to detect potential complications.

Patients and Methods: We report the case of a 67-year-old man with diffuse swelling of the cheek and the discharge of pus from the parotid duct orifice caused by a fish bone that had penetrated into the parotid duct. The preoperative examination using ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a linear foreign body. Results: The fish bone was thought to be embedded deeply in the parotid duct; therefore, we used a combined approach (endoscopy with open surgery), because we anticipated difficulties with endoscopic removal of the fish bone. The endoscopic view showed that the fish bone had partially penetrated the soft tissue in the parotid duct wall, but the fish bone could not be removed endoscopically. With endoscopic assistance, the impacted fish bone was removed using an intraoral surgical approach.

2014,"Yang, C.","Yang, C; Li, J; Fu, W; Xu, W; Yang, S",Cochrane Database Of Systematic Reviews,Interventions for dysphagia in oesophageal cancer,"Abstract - Background Most patients with oesophageal and gastro‐oesophageal carcinoma are diagnosed at an advanced stage and require palliative intervention. Although there are many kinds of interventions, the optimal one for the palliation of dysphagia remains unclear. This review updates the previous version published in 2009. Objectives The aim of this review was to systematically analyse and summarise the efficacy of different interventions used in the palliation of dysphagia in primary oesophageal and gastro‐oesophageal carcinoma. Search methods To find new studies for this updated review, in January 2014 we searched, according to the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases model, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library ), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL; and major conference proceedings (up to January 2014).   Selection criteria Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in which patients with inoperable or unresectable primary oesophageal cancer underwent palliative treatment. Different interventions like rigid plastic intubation, self‐expanding metallic stent (SEMS) insertion, brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy, chemotherapy, oesophageal bypass surgery, chemical and thermal ablation therapy, either head‐to‐head or in combination, were included. The primary outcome was dysphagia improvement. Secondary outcomes included recurrent dysphagia, technical success, procedure related mortality, 30‐day mortality, adverse effects and quality of life. Data collection and analysis Data collection and analysis were performed in accordance with the methods of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Review Group. Main results We included 3684 patients from 53 studies. SEMS insertion was safer and more effective than plastic tube insertion. Thermal and chemical ablative therapy provided comparable dysphagia palliation but had an increased requirement for re‐interventions and for adverse effects. Anti‐reflux stents provided comparable dysphagia palliation to conventional metal stents. Some anti‐reflux stents might have reduced gastro‐oesophageal reflux and complications. Newly‐designed double‐layered nitinol (Niti‐S) stents were preferable due to longer survival time and fewer complications compared to simple Niti‐S stents. Brachytherapy might be a suitable alternative to SEMS in providing a survival advantage and possibly a better quality of life, and might provide better results when combined with argon plasma coagulation or external beam radiation therapy. Authors' conclusions Self‐expanding metal stent insertion is safe, effective and quicker in palliating dysphagia compared to other modalities. However, high‐dose intraluminal brachytherapy is a suitable alternative and might provide additional survival benefit with a better quality of life. Some anti‐reflux stents and newly‐designed stents lead to longer survival and fewer complications compared to conventional stents. Combinations of brachytherapy with self‐expanding metal stent insertion or radiotherapy are preferable due to the reduced requirement for re‐interventions. Rigid plastic tube insertion, dilatation alone or in combination with other modalities, and chemotherapy alone are not recommended for palliation of dysphagia due to a high incidence of delayed complications and recurrent dysphagia. Plain language summary Interventions for reducing difficulty in swallowing in people with oesophageal cancer Review question For most patients with unresectable or inoperable oesophageal cancer, providing clinical benefit with palliative treatment is highly desirable. However, the optimal palliative technique for dysphagia improvement and better quality of life is not established. Background Dysphagia (difficulty or discomfort in swallowing) is common among patients with unresectable or inoperable oesophageal cancer. There are five levels of dysphagia, ranging from the ability to eat a normal diet to some solids, semisolids, liquids and to complete dysphagia. Study characteristics The review included randomised controlled studies comparing the use of different interventions to improve dysphagia among patients with inoperable or unresectable primary oesophageal cancer. To find new studies for this updated review, in January 2014 we searched, according to the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases model, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library ), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL; and major conference proceedings (up to January 2014). Key results The review updates the previous version but still fails to present any obvious superiority of one technique over another among the different kinds of interventions. Self‐expanding metal stents provided safer and more effective relief of dysphagia compared to rigid plastic stents. Other techniques like radiotherapy or brachytherapy were also suitable alternatives and might be favourable in improving quality of life and prolonging survival. Individual differences should be emphasised when the intervention type was determined. Quality of the evidence Half of the studies included in this review were of high quality. Most studies did not state the methods used to seek and report quality of life outcomes and adverse effects.",10.1002/14651858.cd005048.pub4,Cochrane

It has attracted great interest among mental health  professionals over the last decades. However, this issue is rarely reported in  the literature. A deep exploration of its clinical and specific  psychopathological aspects remains limited. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a  32-year-old female patient, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for homicide  against her cousin, the daughter of an uncle who had raped her when she was 14.  This affair was hushed by the patient's family and the patient was submitted to  several acts of abuse by her family. Following her incarceration, she repeatedly  ingested metallic objects requiring repeated admissions in a department of  surgery for endoscopic extractions or surgical interventions. She impulsively  ingested more than 30 times various metallic objects such as wire, razor blades,  spoons, etc., under the pressure of impulsiveness and massive anxiety. Voluntary  metal ingestions, associated with iterative self-mutilation behaviors, took place  within the framework of a borderline personality disorder, the incarceration and  the conditions of imprisonment playing a role in initiating and retaining the  behavior. CONCLUSION: Through this case report, we examine the specific  psychiatric aspects of intentional ingestion of metallic objects in order to  better understand this behavior.",10.1016/j.encep.2013.06.002,PubMed

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 194 patients with a  diagnosis of foreign body impaction in the upper gastrointestinal tract,  confirmed by endoscopy, at two university hospital in South Korea. Patient  demographic data, including age, gender, intention to ingestion, symptoms at  admission, and comorbidities, were collected. Clinical features of the foreign  bodies, such as type, size, sharpness of edges, number, and location, were  analyzed. Endoscopic data those were analyzed included duration of foreign body  impaction, duration of endoscopic performance, endoscopic device, days of  hospitalization, complication rate, 30-d mortality rate, and the number of  operations related to foreign body removal. RESULTS: The types of upper  gastrointestinal foreign bodies included fish bones, drugs, shells, meat, metal,  and animal bones. The locations of impacted foreign bodies were the upper  esophagus (57.2%), mid esophagus (28.4%), stomach (10.8%), and lower esophagus  (3.6%). The median size of the foreign bodies was 26.2 ± 16.7 mm. Among 194  patients, endoscopic removal was achieved in 189, and complications developed in  51 patients (26.9%). Significant complications associated with foreign body  impaction and removal included deep lacerations with minor bleeding (n = 31,  16%), ulcer (n = 11, 5.7%), perforation (n = 3, 1.5%), and abscess (n = 1, 0.5%).  Four patients underwent operations because of incomplete endoscopic foreign body  extraction. In multivariate analyses, risk factors for endoscopic complications  and failure were sharpness (HR = 2.48, 95%CI: 1.07-5.72; P = 0.034) and a greater  than 12-h duration of impaction (HR = 2.42, 95%CI: 1.12-5.25, P = 0.025).

The purpose of this article was to evaluate the usefulness of ultralow-dose chest CT as an initial imaging study for evaluation of sharp fish bone esophageal foreign body (FB). MATERIALS AND METHODS. A total of 57 subjects who underwent ultralow-dose chest CT were included in this retrospective study. All subjects had a history of ingestion and symptoms of esophageal FB. All ultralow-dose chest CT data were reconstructed twice, once with filtered back projection (FBP) and once with iterative reconstruction, and three observers reviewed the images independently. ROC analysis was used to evaluate diagnostic performance of ultralow-dose chest CT. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for analysis of interobserver agreement. RESULTS. Among 57 patients, 42 were confirmed as having esophageal FB. Significant objective noise reduction of mediastinum was achieved using an iterative reconstruction technique. Subjective image noise of iterative reconstruction was significantly better than that of FBP. Overall diagnostic performance of ultralow-dose chest CT for esophageal FB of iterative reconstruction (AUC = 0.999) was significantly better than that of FBP (AUC = 0.95) (p = 0.02). Interobserver agreement was greater for iterative reconstruction (ICC = 0.944) than for FBP (ICC = 0.778). CONCLUSION. Ultralow-dose chest CT using iterative reconstruction provided satisfactory diagnostic image quality for identifying fish bone esophageal FB with reduced radiation dose and high observer accuracy. Therefore, ultralow-dose chest CT would be adequate as a first-line imaging modality for fish bone esophageal FB.",10.2214/ajr.15.14353,Web of Science

In order to avoid complications such as perforation,  endoscopic removal of potentially penetrating foreign bodies should be attempted  quickly. The use of various endoscopic techniques has been reported for this  purpose. However, extraction of foreign bodies from the mid gastrointestinal  tract has rarely been reported. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a patient who  had swallowed a safety needle which could safely be removed from the jejunum by  means of double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE). The combination of a thin p-type  enteroscope with a thick t-type overtube was used in order to improve the  manoeuvrability of the endoscope. The needle was pulled into the overtube which  served as a protective shield during the retrieval of the endoscope. CONCLUSION:  Our case report describes the potential of removing foreign bodies from the deep  small bowel by pulling them into the overtube of a double-balloon enteroscope. If  the suspicion of foreign body impaction in the small bowel is made, it may be  advisable to primarily choose a balloon enteroscopy system. Through this, quick  and deep insertion can be combined with a safe removal of the foreign body.",10.1055/s-0035-1553196,PubMed

Previous trials and meta‐analyses have led to different conclusions on whether a high fraction of supplemental inspired oxygen during anaesthesia may decrease or increase mortality and surgical site infections in surgical patients. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of an FIO 2  equal to or greater than 60% compared with a control FIO 2  at or below 40% in the perioperative setting in terms of mortality, surgical site infection, respiratory insufficiency, serious adverse events and length of stay during the index admission for adult surgical patients. We looked at various outcomes, conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses, examined the role of bias and applied trial sequential analysis (TSA) to examine the level of evidence supporting or refuting a high FIO 2  during surgery, anaesthesia and recovery. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, International Web of Science, the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), advanced Google and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) up to February 2014. We checked the references of included trials and reviews for unidentified relevant trials and reran the searches in March 2015. We will consider two studies of interest when we update the review. Selection criteria We included randomized clinical trials that compared a high fraction of inspired oxygen with a routine fraction of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia, surgery and recovery in individuals 18 years of age or older. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data independently. We conducted random‐effects and fixed‐effect meta‐analyses, and for dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs). We used published data and data obtained by contacting trial authors. To minimize the risk of systematic error, we assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. To reduce the risk of random errors caused by sparse data and repetitive updating of cumulative meta‐analyses, we applied trial sequential analyses. We used Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results We included 28 randomized clinical trials (9330 participants); in the 21 trials reporting relevant outcomes for this review, 7597 participants were randomly assigned to a high fraction of inspired oxygen versus a routine fraction of inspired oxygen. In trials with an overall low risk of bias, a high fraction of inspired oxygen compared with a routine fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with all‐cause mortality (random‐effects model: RR 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.36; GRADE: low quality) within the longest follow‐up and within 30 days of follow‐up (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.99, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.60; GRADE: low quality). In a trial sequential analysis, the required information size was not reached and the analysis could not refute a 20% increase in mortality. Similarly, when all trials were included, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with all���cause mortality to the longest follow‐up (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.33) or within 30 days of follow‐up (Peto OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.29), both of very low quality according to GRADE. Neither was a high fraction of inspired oxygen associated with the risk of surgical site infection in trials with low risk of bias (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.17; GRADE: low quality) or in all trials (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07; GRADE: low quality). A high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with respiratory insufficiency (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.99), serious adverse events (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43) or length of stay (mean difference ‐0.06 days, 95% CI ‐0.44 to 0.32 days). In subgroup analyses of nine trials using preoperative antibiotics, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was associated with a decrease in surgical site infections (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97; GRADE: very low quality); a similar effect was noted in the five trials adequately blinded for the outcome assessment (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; GRADE: very low quality). We did not observe an effect of a high fraction of inspired oxygen on surgical site infections in any other subgroup analyses. Authors' conclusions As the risk of adverse events, including mortality, may be increased by a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60% or higher, and as robust evidence is lacking for a beneficial effect of a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60% or higher on surgical site infection, our overall results suggest that evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of a high fraction of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia and surgery. Given the risk of attrition and outcome reporting bias, as well as other weaknesses in the available evidence, further randomized clinical trials with low risk of bias in all bias domains, including a large sample size and long‐term follow‐up, are warranted. Plain language summary The effects of giving adult patients a high inspiratory oxygen fraction around the time of surgery Review question The normal air that we breathe contains 21% oxygen. This systematic review assesses the beneficial and harmful effects of a percentage of inspired oxygen of 60% to 90% compared with a routine percentage of 30% to 40% given during anaesthesia, during surgery and in the immediate recovery period on the numbers of deaths and surgical site infections reported in adult surgical patients. Background Reduced lung and circulatory function during surgery can lead to reduced levels of oxygen (hypoxia). Also, oxygen levels are often low in wounds at the end of surgery. This may impair bacterial killing and wound healing. Trials and previous meta‐analyses have led to different conclusions as to whether a high percentage of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia may decrease or increase the risk of death or surgical site infections. This systematic review used improved Cochrane methodology for carrying out systematic reviews to reassess available evidence derived from randomized clinical trials. Study characteristics We identified 28 randomized clinical trials. Eight trials with 4918 participants reported on risk of death, and 15 trials with 7219 participants reported on surgical site infections within 14 to 30 days of surgery. Four trials reported serious adverse events, three trials respiratory insufficiency, nine trials length of stay during the associated hospital admission and one trial quality of life. All trials were conducted without direct industry funding. The number of participants in each trial ranged from 38 to 2012. The mean age of participants was 50 years (range 15 to 92 years) and 63% were women. Types of surgery included abdominal surgery (eight trials), caesarean section (four trials), breast surgery (one trial), orthopaedic surgery (two trials) and various other surgical procedures (four trials). Key results A high percentage of inspired oxygen was not statistically associated with increased risk of death, or with a decrease in surgical site infections, in all trials that measured these outcomes, in trials of highest quality and in those with longest follow‐up. An increased risk of adverse events could not be proved right or wrong for a high percentage of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia and surgery. Quality and quantity of the evidence Only five of the included trials had low risk of bias. The trials randomly assigned 9330 participants, of whom only 7537 participants provided data for this review. The number of participants required to detect or reject a 20% relative risk reduction in deaths was not reached; therefore the observed results were uncertain.",10.1002/14651858.cd008884.pub2,Cochrane

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional  analysis of national databases; literature review. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The  Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance  System (NEISS) was used to derive a national weighted estimate of emergency  department visits for wire bristle injury from 2002 to 2014. Date, location of  injury, demographics, and outcomes were analyzed. A literature search and a  consumer-reported injury database (SaferProducts.gov) were interrogated to  provide ancillary sources of data. RESULTS: A total of 43 cases were found within  the NEISS database, which extrapolated to an estimated 1698 (95% confidence  interval, 1468-1927) emergency department visits nationwide. In the NEISS  database, the mean age was 30 years, and the sex distribution of the patients was  similar (21 males vs 22 females). The most common location of injury was the  oropharynx in both the NEISS database (23 of 43, 53.4%) and the literature review  (11 of 36, 30.5%).

Metal bodies are the most commonly used in self-harm (over 90%). The self-harm technique is learnt from the inmates with a history of such incidents. The mortality is low (0.4%), refusal of treatment is found in 13% of cases, and recurrence of self-harm is common where the ingestion and intracranial insertion of foreign bodies occurs (42%-50%). Mental disorders, dominated by personality disorders, are found in 46% of patients.",10.4323/rjlm.2016.194,Web of Science
2016,"Crowley, A.","Crowley, AE; Grivell, RM; Dodd, JM",Cochrane Database Of Systematic Reviews,Sealing procedures for preterm prelabour rupture of membranes,"Abstract - Background Preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM) complicates approximately 2% of pregnancies and can be either spontaneous or iatrogenic in nature. Complications of PPROM include prematurity, chorioamnionitis, neonatal sepsis, limb position defects, respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary hypoplasia chronic lung disease, periventricular leukomalacia and intraventricular haemorrhage. A number of different sealing techniques have been employed which aim to restore a physical barrier against infection and encourage the re‐accumulation of amniotic fluid. Routine use of sealants is currently not recommended due to a lack of sufficient evidence to support the safety and effectiveness of such interventions. Objectives To assess the effects of sealing techniques following PPROM against each other, or versus standard care (including no sealant), on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (30 May 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing different techniques for sealing preterm prelabour ruptured membranes. Cluster‐randomised trials and trials using a cross‐over design were not eligible for inclusion in this review. We planned to include abstracts when sufficient information was provided. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed trial quality. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. Main results We included two studies (involving 141 women ‐ with data from 124 women). We considered both studies as being at high risk of bias. Meta‐analysis was not possible because the included studies examined different interventions (both in comparison with standard care) and reported on few, but different, outcomes. One study compared cervical adapter (mechanical sealing), and the other study examined an immunological membrane sealant. Neither of the included studies reported on this review's primary outcome of interest ‐ perinatal mortality. Similarly, data were not reported for the majority of this review's secondary infant and maternal outcomes. Cervical adapter (mechanical sealing) versus standard care (one study, data from 35 participants) No data were reported for this review's primary outcome ‐  perinatal mortality . Data were reported for few of this review's infant or maternal secondary outcomes. There was no clear difference between the mechanical sealing group and the standard care control in relation to the incidence of  neonatal sepsis  (risk ratio (RR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 5.09 ( very low‐quality evidence )) or  chorioamnionitis  (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.28 to 5.09 ( very low‐quality evidence )). Oral immunological membrane sealant versus standard care (one study, data from 94 participants) No data were available for  perinatal mortality  (this review's primary outcome) or for the majority of this review's infant and maternal secondary outcomes. Compared to standard care, the immunological membrane sealant was associated with a reduction in  preterm birth less than 37 weeks  (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.68 ( very low‐quality evidence )) and a reduction in  neonatal death  (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.75 ( very low‐quality evidence) ). However, there was no clear difference between groups in terms of  neonatal sepsis  (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.46 ( very low‐quality evidence )) or  respiratory distress syndrome  (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.46 ( very low‐quality evidence )). Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to evaluate sealing procedures for PPROM. There were no data relating to this review's primary outcome (perinatal mortality) and the majority of our infant and maternal secondary outcomes were not reported in the two included studies. There was limited evidence to suggest that an immunological membrane sealant was associated with a reduction in preterm birth at less than 37 weeks and neonatal death, but these results should be interpreted with caution as this is based on one small study, with a high risk of bias, and the intervention has not been tested in other studies. Although midtrimester PPROM is not a rare occurrence, there are only a small amount of published data addressing the benefits and risks of sealing procedures. Most of these studies are retrospective and cohort based and could therefore not be included in our data‐analysis. This review highlights the paucity of prospective randomised trials in this area. Current evidence provides limited information both on effectiveness and safety for the interventions described. Given the paucity of high‐quality data, we recommend that future research efforts focus on the conduct of randomised trials assessing the effect of promising interventions that have been only evaluated to date in cohort studies (e.g. amniopatch). Future trials should address outcomes including perinatal mortality, preterm birth, neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal sepsis and developmental delay. They should also evaluate maternal outcomes including sepsis, mode of delivery, length of hospital stay and emotional well‐being. Plain language summary Treatments for improving outcomes for mother and baby when the waters have broken too early What is the issue? Preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM) is when the waters break at less than 37 weeks' gestation. It occurs in one in 50 pregnancies and can happen spontaneously or after a medical procedure has been performed, for example, tests where a needle is placed in to the womb to get a sample of fluid or tissue, or after an operation has been performed on the baby inside the womb. Why is this important? Breaking of the waters early in pregnancy can lead to significant problems including the baby being born too soon to survive, having immature lungs, and serious infections. Preterm babies are overall more likely to be ill and to suffer from long‐term disabilities, if they do survive. The survival of babies affected by PPROM is related to how early it occurs in the pregnancy and if an infection occurs. In some circumstances, the waters may reseal themselves. This is more likely to occur when no infection is present. Several treatments to reseal the membranes have been tried, with varying success. Resealing has been attempted by: a) injecting clotting factors and other medicines in to the hole in the womb to create a patch over the area that is leaking; b) taking tablets that may stimulate the body’s immune system to mend the area where the seal has broken; c) placing a sponge over the hole in the waters; d) placing a seal over the neck of the womb to stop fluid leaking out and prevent infection. Our study is important because finding a successful treatment for PPROM may reduce the potential complications that may happen to the mother and baby such as preterm birth (being born before 37 weeks' gestation) and infections. What did we find? In our study we assessed the different techniques used for resealing the waters. We aimed to compare the survival of babies affected with this condition before and after birth and look at the rates of complications in both the babies and mothers. We searched for trials (30 May 2016) and found two studies that compared treatments for resealing the membranes after they had broken. These trials involved 141 women in total and compared two completely different modes of treatment. One trial compared the use of an oral immunological membrane sealant to stimulate the body’s immune system to mend the area where the seal has broken and the other trial placed a mechanical sealing device over the cervix (neck of the womb) to stop fluid leaking. Unfortunately, neither trial provided any data relating to death of the baby within the womb or in the first 28 days of life (perinatal mortality). There was limited evidence to suggest that oral immunological membrane sealant was associated with a fewer babies being before 37 weeks’ gestation and a reduction in the number of babies that died within the first 28 days. However, these results are based on  very low‐quality evidence  from one small trial (with data from 94 women) that we judged to be at a high risk of bias. There was no clear difference between the mechanical sealing device group and the control group in relation to the number of babies who contracted a serious infection (neonatal sepsis) or chorioamnionitis (a bacterial infection that causes inflammation of the membranes surrounding the baby in the womb). Although these results are based on  very low‐quality evidence  from one small trial (involving 35 women) judged to be at a high risk of bias. What does this mean? Overall, our question remains unanswered ‐ we do not have enough data to fully evaluate sealing procedures for PPROM. This review demonstrates the lack of research in this area regarding the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments for PPROM. We recommend that more research is needed to look at the different techniques for sealing broken waters and that this research should focus on the effectiveness of the treatment in improving overall outcomes. The safety of the treatments to both mother and baby must be further evaluated before sealing techniques can be recommended to prevent adverse outcomes.",10.1002/14651858.cd010218.pub2,Cochrane

No similar case of internal injuries following  unintentional ingestion of a barbecue grill cleaning brush bristle has been  reported. A 58-year-old Caucasian male with no significant history presented with  complaint of halitosis, not improving after oral care and dental hygiene  measures. He denied any other symptoms. After ruling out oral causes of  halitosis, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, which revealed a black  wire-shaped metallic FB embedded in the duodenum. The FB was identified as a  silver metallic flexible wire resembling the bristle of a barbecue grill cleaning  brush. The halitosis resolved completely within 3 weeks of the removal of the FB.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of duodenal impaction of a  barbecue grill cleaning brush bristle atypically presenting with halitosis.  Physicians' awareness of this potential injury from grill cleaning brush bristles  would lead to a quick diagnosis after a focused history. Also avid grillers must  be made aware of this potential hazard and should be encouraged to carefully  examine the barbecue grill surface for any remnant bristle of the grill cleaning  brush.

This study was to identify  factors related to outcomes of FB ingestion, particularly BBs in the stomach. We  evaluated whether the current recommendations are appropriate and aimed to  suggest indications for endoscopic removal of BB in the stomach in young  children. METHODS: We investigated patient age, shape, size, location of FBs,  spontaneous passage time and resulting complications among 76 children. We  observed types, size, location of BB and outcomes, and analyzed their  associations with complications. RESULTS: Coins and BB were the two most common  FBs. Their shapes and sizes were not associated with the spontaneous passage  time. Size, spontaneous passage time, and age were also not associated with any  specific complications. For BB ingestion, all 5 cases with lithium batteries  (≥1.5 cm, 3 V) presented moderate to major complications in the esophagus and  stomach without any symptoms, even when the batteries were in the stomach and  beyond the duodenum, while no complications were noted in 7 cases with alkaline  batteries (<1.5 cm, 1.5 V) (p=0.001). All endoscopies were conducted within 24  hours after ingestion. CONCLUSION: The type and voltage of the battery should be  considered when determining whether endoscopy is required to remove a BB in the  stomach. For lithium battery ingestion in young children, urgent endoscopic  removal might be important in order to prevent complications, even if the child  is asymptomatic and the battery is smaller than 2 cm.",10.5223/pghn.2016.19.1.20,PubMed

Plain language summary Fasting for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding Review question To determine the effects and safety of fasting for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding. Background Gastrointestinal bleeding refers to loss of blood from any site of the digestive tract. If the bleeding site is near the ligament of Treitz (the muscle extending from the junction of the duodenum and jejunum to the diaphragm), it is described as upper gastrointestinal bleeding. If the bleeding site is away from the ligament of Treitz, it is described as lower gastrointestinal bleeding. People with a small amount of blood loss may have no symptoms, and have bloody vomiting or see blood in the stool with increased bleeding. Chronic mild gastrointestinal bleeding can lead to anaemia, causing fatigue or pallor; acute massive gastrointestinal bleeding can be life‐threatening. Gastrointestinal bleeding has two scenarios in children. The first is a complaint of attending the emergency department as a symptom of diseases such as ulcers, gastritis, Mallory‐Weiss tears, anorectal fissures, allergic colitis, infectious colitis, intussusception, Henoch‐Schonlein purpura, and Meckel's diverticulum. The second occurs in critically ill children hospitalised in intensive care units and is caused by stress‐induced gastropathy. The incidence of the first scenario has not been well established, but there are substantial cases in paediatric intensive care units in the second scenario. Whatever the cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, fasting is believed to be necessary due to the fear that eating may affect haemostasis or aggravate bleeding.

Our previous research examined determinants of hospital admission, endoscopy, and surgery among prisoners who ingest foreign objects. However, little is known about the financial impact of these events on healthcare facilities that service the prisoner population. This study aims to fill this gap by examining hospital charges attributable to 435 prisoner episodes of IIFO. Methods: A retrospective review of all prisoners who presented to our medical center with the complaint of IIFO was conducted. Both Institutional Review Board and Bureau of Prisons approvals were obtained before data collection. All prisoners ages 18-75 were included between the dates of January 2004 and December 2011. Episodes were divided into three categories: (a) Unverified IIFO wherein ingested object was claimed by the patient but never identified; (b) verified IIFO wherein ingested object was clearly identified; (c) secondary events due to direct complications of previous IIFO episode (s). The temporal occurrence of IIFO was organized by increasing the number of episodes and grouped accordingly. Detailed list of hospital charges was obtained for every IIFO episode including: (a) emergency services, (b) procedures, (c) laboratory, (d) surgical supplies, (e) allied health services, (f) radiology studies, (g) anesthesiology charges, (h) pharmacy, and (h) intensive care costs. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze basic data. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine differences among nonnormally distributed variables and sub-groups. Statistical significance set at alpha = 0.05. Results: A total of 435 IIFO episodes occurred during the study period in a population of 125 patients (mean age 33.8 +/- 11.7 years, median age 34 [range 19-75] years, 92.8% male). Hospital charges associated with these episodes totaled $6,209,557. There were 94 unverified IIFOs, 332 verified IIFOs, and 9 secondary events. Verified IIFOs were associated with significantly greater median charges ($5,860) than unverified IIFOs ($3,997) and secondary events carried lower cost ($3,501) than the former two (P < 0.01). We also observed a pattern of escalating costs associated with increasing number of sequential IIFO episodes, with the 1st episode carrying median charges of $4,683 and episodes numbered 11+ carrying median charges of $7,698 (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Hospital charges associated with the care of prisoners who ingest foreign objects tend to escalate over time. Although charges in most of the categories demonstrated increases with greater numbers of ingestions, the largest contributors to this pattern of escalating charges included radiology, pharmacy, hospital room charges, and surgical services. These findings suggest that early intervention in the destructive cycle of IIFO may not only improve patient outcomes but also result in savings to the healthcare system.

Therefore, this  study compares the advantages and disadvantages of both endoscopic procedures  from a clinical perspective. METHODS: A retrospective review was made of 273  patients suspected of esophageal FBs in emergency consultations of a tertiary  medical referral center from March 2010 to March 2014. All patients received  routine physical examinations, otolaryngological examinations, and X-rays of the  neck and chest. The door-to-endoscopy time, procedure time, postendoscopic  hospital stay, successful removal rates, and complications were analyzed as well.  RESULTS: In this study, the most common esophageal FBs were fish and animal bones  (76%) in adults and coins (74%) in children. The patients with existing  esophageal FBs had significantly more frequent symptoms of dysphagia and signs of  linear opacity as detected with lateral neck radiography than those without FB.  Additionally, the door-to-endoscopy time, procedure time, and postendoscopic  hospital stay was significantly shorter in FE patients than in RE patients.  However, both RE and FE patients had high rates of successful FB removal (95%)  and low complication rates (2%). CONCLUSION: Both FE and RE remove esophageal FBs  successfully, as evidenced by their high success rates, low complication rates,  and high detection rates.

Unintentional foreign body ingestion commonly occurs accidentally in children aged between 3 months and 6 years and at advanced ages or results from psychiatric disorders such as hallucination in patients with mental retardation. Most of the ingested foreign bodies are naturally discharged from the body but some of them may require surgical intervention. Presentation of Case. A 29-year-old mentally retarded female patient was admitted to the emergency service with a two-day history of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness, defense, and rebound on palpation. Radiological examination revealed diffuse air-fluid levels and a radiopaque impression of a metal object in the right upper quadrant. The metal teaspoon causing ileal perforation was extracted by emergency laparotomy. On postoperative day 7, the patient was uneventfully discharged following a psychiatric consultation. Discussion. Foreign body ingestion can occur intentionally in children at developing ages and old-age patients, or adults and prisoners, whereas it may occur unintentionally in patients with mental retardation due to hallucination. However, repeated foreign body ingestion is very rare in individuals other than mentally retarded patients. Conclusion.

Whilst resorbable plates appear to offer clinical advantages over metal plates in orthognathic surgery, concerns remain about the stability of fixation and the length of time required for their degradation and the possibility of foreign body reactions. This review compares the use of titanium versus bioresorbable plates in orthognathic surgery and is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2007. Objectives To compare the effects of bioresorbable fixation systems with titanium systems used during orthognathic surgery.

We resolved disagreement by discussion. Clinical heterogeneity between the included trials precluded pooling of data, and only a descriptive summary is presented. Main results This review included two trials, involving 103 participants, one comparing titanium with resorbable plates and screws and the other titanium with resorbable screws. Both studies were at high risk of bias and provided very limited data for the primary outcomes of this review. All participants in one trial suffered mild to moderate postoperative discomfort with no statistically significant difference between the two plating groups at different follow‐up times. Mean scores of patient satisfaction were 7.43 to 8.63 (range 0 to 10) with no statistically significant difference between the two groups throughout follow‐up. Adverse effects reported in one study were two plate exposures in each group occurring between the third and ninth months. Plate exposures occurred mainly in the posterior maxillary region, except for one titanium plate exposure in the mandibular premolar region. Known causes of infection were associated with loosened screws and wound dehiscence with no statistically significant difference in the infection rate between titanium (3/196), and resorbable (3/165) plates. Authors' conclusions We do not have sufficient evidence to determine if titanium plates or resorbable plates are superior for fixation of bones after orthognathic surgery. This review provides insufficient evidence to show any difference in postoperative pain and discomfort, level of patient satisfaction, plate exposure or infection for plate and screw fixation using either titanium or resorbable materials. Plain language summary Resorbable versus titanium plates for corrective jaw surgery Review question Are resorbable (biodegradable) plates better than titanium (metal) plates for the fixation of facial bones after corrective (orthognathic) jaw surgery? Background Under‐ or overgrowth of one or both of the jaw bones can lead to reduced function and an unattractive facial appearance, either of which may have lasting and significant psychosocial effects. Treatment of severe cases may require a combination of orthodontic appliances and orthognathic (corrective jaw) surgery. After surgery the cut bone needs to be immobilised to ensure that optimal healing takes place. Titanium plates used for fixation are recognised to be the 'gold standard' but recent developments in biomaterials have led to an increased use of bioresorbable plates or screws for corrective jaw surgery. The use of bioresorbable plates for the fixation of facial bones might appear to reduce the need for a further operation for the removal of metal plates. However, whilst resorbable plates do appear to offer certain advantages over metal plates, concerns remain about the stability of fixation, the length of time required for their resorption (being reabsorbed), the possibility of foreign body reactions, and with some of the technical difficulties experienced with resorbable plates. Study characteristics We included two studies that analysed a total of 103 participants. The evidence in this review is up to date as of 20 January 2017. Study participants were adults older than 16 years of age. One study compared titanium with resorbable plates and screws and the other titanium with resorbable screws. One study was conducted in China, the other in Germany. Key results Both studies were at high risk of bias and provided very limited data. We do not have sufficient evidence to determine if titanium plates or resorbable plates are superior for the fixation of bones after corrective jaw surgery. This review provides insufficient evidence to show any difference in postoperative pain and discomfort, level of patient satisfaction, plate exposure or infection for plate and screw fixation using either titanium or resorbable materials. Quality of the evidence Both included studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias and the very limited and weak evidence was of very low quality.",10.1002/14651858.cd006204.pub3,Cochrane

METHOD: Five primary caregivers of children  with a history of dysphagia and/or feeding difficulties post-ingestion injury (4  chemical, 1 button battery) completed the Children's Picky Eating Questionnaire  (CPEQ), and participated in a semi-structured interview. Interviews explored  experiences of caring for a child with dysphagia and/or feeding difficulties,  impressions of services and supports, and additional impacts to the child and  family. Content analysis was used to identify key themes. RESULT: Primary  caregiver report and CPEQ results confirmed all children had some degree of  persisting dysphagia and/or feeding difficulties at time of interview (mean 4.13  years' post-injury). Interviews identified five key themes: 1) The initial trauma  of the injury, 2) The experience of associated and ongoing medical issues, 3)  Managing altered oral intake, 4) Experiences of services and support, and 5)  Impacts on the child, primary caregiver, and wider family unit.

IIFOs often require surgical or endoscopic interventions, extended hospital stays, and may result in significant morbidity or even mortality. Although psychiatric illness is prevalent among prisoners engaging in IIFO, this association remains poorly defined. The aim of this study is to describe the psychiatric illness profile among prisoners diagnosed with IIFO. We hypothesized that repeated episodes of IIFO are associated with an escalating pattern of documented psychiatric illness. Methods: After approvals were obtained from our Institutional Review Board and the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, a retrospective study was conducted of prisoners presenting to our facility with IIFO between 2004 and 2011. All historical and concurrent psychiatric diagnoses were abstracted from the medical record and classified into Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition based categories. In addition, medical history, alcohol/drug use, and prior episodes of IIFO were recorded. Statistical analyses included Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests for categorical and continuous data, respectively. Results: We analyzed 136 IIFO episodes involving 27 patients. Repeat IIFO episodes were associated with an increasing number of psychiatric diagnoses. Patients with their fifth or later IIFO had a larger number of psychiatric diagnoses and the number of objects ingested as compared to patients presenting with a first episode (P < 0.01). Similarly, patients who went on to present with additional episodes of IIFO during the study had more psychiatric diagnoses identified throughout their visits (P < 0.01). The proportion of patients with mood and anxiety disorders (including post-traumatic stress) was progressively greater among prisoners with recurrent episodes of IIFO (P < 0.05). Other psychiatric disorders were not significantly associated with IIFO escalation. Conclusions: We observed a significant association between IIFO recurrences and increases in both the quantity of ingested items and the number of documented psychiatric diagnoses. Of note, psychiatric diagnoses of malingering or secondary gain were not identified in the current patient sample. Consideration of early psychiatric evaluation and intervention in the setting of IIFO, especially recurrent IIFO, is strongly encouraged.

METHODS: Patients admitted with ingested  foreign bodies were identified in the Kids' Inpatient Database (1997-2009).  RESULTS: Overall, 7480 cases were identified. Patients were most commonly <5years  of age (44%), male (54%), and Caucasian (57%). A total of 2506 procedures were  performed, GI surgical procedures (57%) most frequently, followed by GI endoscopy  (24%), esophagoscopy (11%), and bronchoscopy - in cases of inhaled objects (9%).

S.",Advances In Physiology Education,The value of homemade phantoms for training veterinary students in the ultrasonographic detection of radiolucent foreign bodies,"Ingested or penetrating foreign bodies are common in veterinary medicine. When they are radiolucent, these objects become a diagnostic challenge, but they can  be investigated sonographically. However, successful object identification  depends on the skill of the sonographer. Considering that these cases appear  randomly during hospital routines, it is not always possible to train all  students to identify them correctly. Therefore, the aim of this study was to  produce homemade simulations of radiolucent foreign bodies for veterinary student  demonstrations that could be identified sonographically and to evaluate the  acceptability, applicability, and usefulness of these simulations according to a  visual analog scale questionnaire and subjective questions. For this purpose,  object models (a pacifier nipple, a toy ball, a sock, nylon thread, and a mango  seed) were designed, produced, and immersed in gelatin. To simulate wood  splinters in the integumentary and musculoskeletal system, a piece of meat  punctured with a toothpick and ice cream stick splinters were used.

Here, we report a case of intentionally swallowed coins in the  oesophagus of an adult; the coins could not be detected on chest radiography but  were detected using computed tomography (CT). CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old  woman with a history of depression presented to the emergency department after an  intentional medication overdose and ingestion of two Japanese 1-yen coins. She  complained of persistent retrosternal discomfort. In order to confirm whether the  coins were in the oesophagus or trachea, an anteroposterior chest radiograph was  obtained; however, no coins were detected. Owing to her persistent symptoms, a  chest CT was performed. On the initial CT scan, two 1-yen coins were observed in  the oesophagus: one in the middle oesophagus and the other in the lower  oesophagus. After the scanning, the patient drank water with permission, but  vomited. No coins were found in her vomit, and the symptoms of retrosternal  discomfort had completely disappeared. A subsequent CT scan revealed that the two  1-yen coins were in the patient's stomach. CONCLUSIONS: Japanese 1-yen coins are  made of 100% aluminium, which is less radiopaque than the metals that make up  coins (nickel, bronze, and lead), and so, they were not visible via chest  radiography in our case. Detecting very small or thin radiolucent foreign bodies  is not possible using a chest radiograph or contrast oesophagram, but is possible  via CT. CT is both increasingly convenient and non-invasive, unlike endoscopy or  bronchoscopy, and so, the use of CT scans should be considered in cases of  possible radiolucent foreign body ingestion.",10.1186/s12245-017-0153-8,PubMed

Prevention is especially important in a psychiatric setting. This study aimed to analyze the incidence of inedible substance ingestion in a Japanese psychiatric hospital. Methods: Inedible substance ingestion incidents were extracted from an incident report database spanning 2000–2012 at a 400‐bed psychiatric hospital in Japan. We tabulated the frequencies of incidents in accordance with major diagnosis, ingested materials, incident levels, and time of occurrence. Results: The incidence rate was 0.09/1000 patient days, and 149 cases in 105 patients were classified as having experienced inedible substance ingestion. The most common diagnosis was dementia (n = 58), followed by schizophrenia (n = 22). Materials ingested by dementia patients were nappies or gauze attached to the patient's body after medical procedures. Materials ingested by schizophrenic patients were liquid soap, detergent or shampoo, and cigarettes. Inedible substance ingestion among dementia patients occurred mostly before or during meals. Among schizophrenic patients, the peak period of incidents was in the evening. Conclusions: Dementia patients were overrepresented in the inedible substance ingestion incidents. Items they wore or applied to their bodies were often subject to ingestion, and such behaviours mostly occurred around meal time. Therefore, the nursing staff were able to discover them quickly and treat most of the cases free of serious consequences. In contrast, schizophrenic patients were underrepresented in the incidents, and most cases involved ingestion of detergent powder or cigarettes, resulting in more serious consequences and requiring treatment.

Increasing prevalence of smaller, more technologically advanced toys  in the household has resulted in an increased exposure to higher voltage  batteries and powerful magnets that carry a high incidence of morbidity and  mortality. This review highlights the latest findings regarding the patients at  risk for button battery and magnet ingestions, the symptoms of presentation, and  complications of these objects in contributing to long-standing gastrointestinal  injury. RECENT FINDINGS: Button batteries may lead to esophageal injury within a  few hours. Batteries retained in the esophagus are larger in diameter on average  and size is associated with esophageal impaction as well as higher grade  esophageal injury. Magnet ingestions, when multiple or with another metallic  object, are often initially asymptomatic but may have acute worsening, and  therefore warrant close monitoring. SUMMARY: Button battery and magnet ingestions  have increased in incidence over the past two decades. Recent literature  demonstrates that higher voltage, larger lithium button batteries, and prevalence  of high-powered magnets can lead to significant morbidity. High suspicion, early  referral, and removal may lead to improved outcomes.",10.1097/mop.0000000000000665,PubMed

CASE REPORT A 64-year-old man came to our attention  for retention in the cervical esophagus of a piece of meat accidentally swallowed  during lunch. After a few attempts of endoscopic removal carried out previously  in other hospitals, the patient has been treated by us with a cervical  esophagotomy and removal of the foreign body, without any complications.

CONCLUSIONS The crucial point is to differentiate the cases that must  be immediately treated from those requiring simple observation. Endoscopic  treatment is definitely the first therapeutic option, but in case of failure of  this approach, in our opinion, cervical esophagotomy could be a safe, easy,  viable, durable approach for the extraction of foreign bodies impacted in the  cervical esophagus.

In this report, we present  a rare case of razor blades lodged in the appendix as a result of intentional  ingestion. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 25 year old male prisoner presented to our  hospital with persistent right iliac fossa pain after razor blade ingestion.  After 5 days of conservative management, there was no sign of transition on  serial X-Rays. Laparoscopy with intraoperative image intensification confirmed  the presence of the razor blades in the appendix and appendicectomy was  subsequently performed without complications. DISCUSSION: Most ingested objected  with diameter less than 2.5 cm and length less than 6 cm can pass through the  gastrointestinal tract spontaneously in less than one week. The entry of foreign  objects into the appendix is thought to be due to relative low motility of the  caecum, the dependent position of the appendix and the size of the appendiceal  orifice. Radiographic localisation to the appendiceal lumen was complicated by  metallic artefact, but was consistent with failure to transit. Appendicectomy was  felt to be the safest mode of retrieval. CONCLUSION: Ingested foreign body lodged  in the appendix is a rare event. Once the exact location is confirmed, a simple  laparoscopic appendicectomy can be performed to facilitate the removal.",10.1016/j.ijscr.2018.03.018,PubMed

The aim of this study was to highlight the importance of timely intervention to extract these FBs. Patients and methods Between November 2012 and October 2017, patients who presented to our department with variously ingested FBs were retrospectively reviewed to detect those who needed intervention (surgical or endoscopic) to extract these FBs. Results During the specified time period, 480 patients with FB ingestion presented to our department. Out of these children, 12 patients ingested uncommon FBs or presented with symptoms of complications of impaction and needed intervention to extract these FBs. Three patients ingested multiple magnets. Three patients ingested pins which were impacted in and penetrated the duodenum. One patient ingested a screw which was impacted in the appendix. One patient ingested a sticky rubber toy which was impacted in the pylorus. One patient ingested hair (bezoar), which was also impacted in the pylorus. One patient ingested a disk battery which was impacted in and penetrated the esophagus, and all were surgically extracted. One patient had a slipped stent of repaired choanal atresia which was impacted in the gastroesophageal junction and one patient with repaired tracheoesophageal fistula ingested a stone which was impacted at the site of esophageal anastomosis, and both were endoscopically retrieved. Conclusion Children who ingested uncommon FBs or presented late with symptoms of complications of impaction needed intervention (surgically or endoscopically) to extract these FBs.

RECENT FINDINGS: Foreign body  ingestion (FBI) is a problem that is frequently encountered by pediatric  providers. As new toys and products enter the marketplace, there may also be new  dangers from those objects not initially recognized. Some of the recent trends  and findings in pediatric FBI include an increase in adolescent injury from  ingestion of laundry detergent pods because of a popular game where participants  are encouraged to bite or swallow the pods, and injuries associated with  ingesting parts of a popular toy known as a 'Fidget Spinner'. SUMMARY: Adverse  events resulting from FBI range the entire gamut from nonexistent or minor  symptoms to moderate injury and rarely may be fatal. Factors such as age, type of  object ingested, anatomic location of the foreign body, and timing from ingestion  to receipt of medical attention all determine the risk posed to the child and  guide management decisions. Because of the constant development of products, and  the potential for the emergence of new and dangerous trends among children,  continued surveillance by the medical community is important in monitoring and  managing injuries associated with FBI.",10.1097/mop.0000000000000670,PubMed

Information regarding psychiatric risk indicators was extracted from participants’ psychiatric records. Generalized linear models with negative binomial distribution and log link function, as well as chi-square tests, were used to address study aims. Clients with a lifetime atypical/severe NSSI history met criteria for a significantly greater number of psychiatric risk indicators than clients with a lifetime history of common NSSI only; however, these clients were not significantly more likely to report recent suicidal actions. Individuals with an atypical/severe NSSI history may demonstrate more severe psychopathology than those with a history of common NSSI only. Thus, it may be clinically useful to consider individuals with an atypical/severe NSSI history as a high-risk subgroup. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This review provides an outline of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, management,  and anesthetic implications in children who have ingested a button battery.  SOURCE: A literature search was conducted in the United States National Library  of Medicine PubMed database using the terms ""button battery ingestion"" and  ""children' and ""removal"" and ""surgery"" and ""anesthesia"". Ninety-six articles  published in English were found from 1983-2017, and 62 of these articles were  incorporated into this review. Additionally, the Internet was searched with the  terms ""button battery ingestion and children"" to identify further entities,  organizations, and resources affiliated with button battery ingestion in  children. These additional sources were studied and included in this review.  PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Button batteries are ubiquitous in homes and electronic  devices. Since 2006, larger-diameter and higher-voltage batteries have become  available. These are more likely to become impacted in the esophagus after  ingestion and lead to an increase in severe morbidity and mortality due to  caustic tissue injury. Children at the highest risk for complications are those  under six years of age who have ingested batteries > 20 mm in diameter and  sustain prolonged esophageal impaction at the level of the aortic arch with the  negative pole oriented anteriorly. CONCLUSION: Anesthesiologists need to know  about the epidemiology, pathophysiology, complications, and anesthetic management  of children who have ingested button batteries.",10.1007/s12630-017-1023-9,PubMed

Massive  ingestions can result in severe toxicity and even death. We describe a case of  diphenhydramine overdose leading to cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation  (CPR), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) cannulation for refractory  ventricular fibrillation, a process we refer to as extracorporeal cardiopulmonary  resuscitation (ECPR). CASE REPORT: Responding to a call for altered mental  status, emergency medical service (EMS) personnel found an unconscious and  seizing 17-year-old male. He had reportedly developed generalized tonic-clonic  seizures and dysrhythmias after ingesting approximately 800 25-mg diphenhydramine  tablets. He was transferred to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) after  stabilization at a local emergency center. After approximately 7 hours of  clinical stability and normalization of cardiac rhythm, electrolytes, and  acidosis, he developed renewed seizure activity and accelerated ventricular  rhythm leading to hemodynamic collapse and cardiac arrest. He was cannulated for  veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VAECMO) with CPR in progress.  A pharmacobezoar located in his stomach was presumed to be the cause of his  biphasic clinical deterioration. After 5 days, the patient was successfully  weaned from ECMO support. Ten days later, his convalescence continued in the  step-down unit and was discharged with good functional outcome. DISCUSSION:  Significant ingestion of anticholinergic substances is often fatal. This case  describes a favorable outcome after ECPR and aggressive supportive management  following a large intentional overdose of diphenhydramine.",10.1007/s13181-018-0672-6,PubMed

On the other hand, perforation and abscess formation as complications of FB ingestion are rare. Their presentation is not clinically different from other causes of peritonitis and differential diagnosis is sometimes difficult. The most common cause of FB perforation is due to fish bone ingestion. We present two consecutive cases of complications associated to fish bone ingestion. In the first case, patient had diffused abdominal pain, without laboratory considerable signs of inflammation. Computer tomography (CT) scan evidenced ileal perforation due to a probable FB; in the second case patient presented abdominal pain, leukocytosis and elevated CRP. The CT scan revealed presence of abscess and omental inflammation near ileum. Both patients submitted surgery. In the first case, an enterotomy was done, in the second case omentectomy and abdominal cleaning were performed. Surprisingly, In the second case, the patient claimed for damages in the high suspicion for a medical error occurred in a previous operation. Fortunately, the specimen exam revealed the truth.

METHODS: Children <18years old who  ingested a battery between 1/2011 and 9/2016 at two tertiary care children's  hospitals were reviewed. Demographics, imaging, management and outcomes were  analyzed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square and Wilcoxon Rank-sum tests.  RESULTS: There were 180 battery ingestions. The median age was 3.9 (range 0.7-18)  years, with 78 (43%) males. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain (17%)  and nausea/vomiting (14%). Diagnosis was confirmed with plain radiographs in 170  (94%) patients. Locations on imaging were: stomach (37%), small bowel (24%),  esophagus (18%), colon (11%), and non-specific location past the gastroesophageal  junction (9%). Treatment was dictated by five different subspecialties including  surgery (35%), gastroenterology (25%), emergency medicine (19%), primary  care/emergency with a consulting service (13%), and otolaryngology (8%). All  esophageal batteries (n=33) had an intervention. Interventions included  fluoroscopic balloon extraction (6 attempted, 33% retrieval rate), rigid  esophagoscopy (26 attempted, 96% retrieval rate), and EGD (6 attempted, 83%  retrieval rate). For batteries distal to the gastroesophageal junction 16 (11%)  patients had an intervention. Interventions included EGD (13 patients, 69%  retrieval), colonoscopy (1 patient, successful retrieval), and abdominal surgery  in two patients. CONCLUSION: Isolated batteries that pass the gastroesophageal  junction rarely require intervention and can be managed conservatively. Given the  variability in managing these patients, we developed an evidence based algorithm.  LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 2. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective Study.",10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2018.01.017,PubMed

This study aims to describe characteristics of patients presenting with  suffocation injuries to emergency departments (EDs) in the United States (U.S.)  and to identify factors associated with mortality in this population. METHODS: We  conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study using the 2013 U.S National  Emergency Department Sample database. ED visits with primary diagnoses of  intentional or accidental suffocation injury, and injury by inhalation and  aspiration of foreign bodies or food (ICD-9-CM codes) were included. We performed  descriptive statistics to describe the study population. This was followed by  multivariate analyses to identify factors associated with mortality. RESULTS: We  included a total of 27,381 ED visits for suffocation injuries. Most suffered from  either inhalation and ingestion of food causing obstruction of respiratory tract  or suffocation (51.6%), or suicide and self-inflicted injury by hanging,  strangulation, and suffocation (39.4%). Overall mortality was 10.9%. Over half  (54.7%) of the patients were between 19 and 65 years old. Males were more common  than females (59.1% vs. 40.9%). Over half of the patients (54.9%) were treated  and released from the ED. Factors associated with increased mortality included  male gender, young age (4-18 years), diseases of the cardiac, respiratory,  genitourinary and neurologic systems, intentional self-harm, and self-payer  status. CONCLUSION: Mortality from suffocation injuries remains high with  significant burden on children and adolescents and on patients with intentional  injuries.

This study aimed to analyse the circumstances of self-harm and suicide attempts in a Japanese psychiatric hospital so as to improve management and care. Methods: Incident reports of self-harm and suicide attempts during a 12.4-year period from November 2000 to March 2013 were reviewed. A descriptive analysis was conducted in terms of age, sex, and diagnosis of patients, as well as level, ward, situations, and causes of incidents. Results: During the study period, 90 cases of self-harm and attempted suicide involving 58 patients were reported. The rate of self-harm and suicide attempts was 0.05 per 1000 patient-days. The types of self-harm and suicide attempts included hanging (n = 25), wrist cutting (n = 19), ingestion of foreign objects (n = 17), and others (n = 29). The single case of completed suicide involved hanging, in a patient with schizophrenia. Among 55 patients with relevant data, the most common clinical diagnosis was mood disorder (41.8%), followed by schizophrenia (36.4%). Mood disorder was 3.5 times as prevalent in females as in males (14 vs. 4). Fourteen patients with mood disorder (n = 8) or schizophrenia (n = 6) were repeatedly involved in 46 of 89 cases of self-harm or attempted suicide; 11 were female. One woman with mood disorder attempted suicide 9 times within the same year. The top 3 management and care factors related to self-harm and suicide attempts were failure to adhere to preventive procedures (28%), insufficient therapeutic communication (28%), and difficulty in predicting suicide (20%). Conclusion: Self-harm and suicide attempts at this psychiatric hospital occurred at a rate of 0.05 per 1000 patient-days between late 2000 and early 2013.

2018,"Zhong, B.",Zhong B.-L.; Xu Y.-M.; Xie W.-X.; Chen W.-C.; Lu J.,Frontiers In Psychiatry,Prevalence of deliberate self-harm among chinese patients with heroin dependence: a meta-analysis,"Background: There is paucity of data regarding the prevalence and methods of deliberate self-harm (DSH) in patients with heroin dependence in international literature. In China, there have been a few studies investigating the prevalence of DSH in heroin-dependent patients (HDPs), but their rates varied widely. We thus conducted a meta-analysis of studies assessing the prevalence of DSH among Chinese HDPs. Methods: Relevant studies were retrieved from major Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang data, and SinoMed) and western databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycInfo). Two authors independently identified eligible studies and extracted data. Studies that included a representative sample of Chinese HDPs and ascertained DSH caseness in a reliable way were considered as high quality. Statistical analysis was performed using R software. Results: In total, 15 eligible studies with a total of 37,243 Chinese HDPs were included. All included studies were conducted in heroin detoxification settings. Only two studies were rated as high quality. The pooled prevalence of DSH in Chinese HDPs was 4.4% (95%CI: 2.9, 6.2%), but the heterogeneity of prevalence rates across studies was significant (I2 = 98%, P < 0.001). Studies rated as high quality had significantly higher prevalence of DSH than those rated as low quality (13.2 vs. 3.4%, P < 0.001). Swallowing foreign objects was the most common method of DSH, with a combined prevalence of 2.7% (95%CI: 1.6, 4.4%). Extreme DSH methods such as cutting offfingers and jumping from height were also not uncommon in this patient population. Conclusion: Due to methodological problems in available studies, we find a relatively low prevalence of DSH among Chinese HDPs receiving detoxification treatment. Nevertheless, the self-harmers of Chinese HDPs are more likely to harm themselves in a dangerous or life-threatening way. Restricting the availability of DSH methods may be an effective way to prevent or reduce DSH in China's detoxification treatment settings. © 2018 Zhong, Xu, Xie, Chen and Lu.",10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00325,SCOPUS

Pediatric emergency physicians and gastroenterologists often  encounter nervous and distressed situations, because of children presenting with  this condition in the common clinical practice. When determining the appropriate  timing and indications for intervention, physicians should consider multiple  patient- and FB-related factors. The utilization of a flexible endoscopy is  considered safe and effective to use in these cases, with a high success rate,  for the effective extraction of FBs from the gastrointestinal tract of a child.  Additionally, a Foley catheter and a magnet-attached Levin tube have been used  for decades in the case of FB removal. Although their use has decreased  significantly in recent times, these instruments continue to be used for several  indications. Using a Foley catheter for this purpose does not require special  training and does not necessarily require sedation of the patient or fluoroscopy,  which serve as advantages of utilizing this method for foreign object retrieval.  An ingested magnet or iron-containing FB can be retrieved using a magnet-attached  tube, and can be effective to retrieve an object from any section of the upper  gastrointestinal tract that can be reached. Simple and inexpensive devices such  as Foley catheters and magnet-attached tubes can be used in emergencies such as  with the esophageal impaction of disk batteries if endoscopy cannot be performed  immediately (e.g., in rural areas and/or in patients presenting at midnight in a  facility, especially in those without access to endoscopes or emergency services,  or in any situation that warrants urgent removal of a foreign object).",10.5223/pghn.2019.22.2.132,PubMed

The aim of this study was to present some  practical suggestions for ingested safety pins using an accompanying algorithm,  presented for the first time in the literature to the best of our knowledge.  METHODS: Twenty children with ingested safety pins during a 4-year period were  retrospectively included in the study. RESULTS: Median age of patients was 9.5  months (interquartile range, 6.3-14 months), and 70% were girls. On endoscopic  examination, safety pins were observed in the stomach (25%), duodenal bulb (20%),  upper esophagus (15%), middle esophagus (10%), and second part of the duodenum  (10%) but were not observed in 20% of the cases. Safety pins were removed using  endoscopy in 15 cases (75%). In four cases (20%), no safety pin was observed on  endoscopic examination. In one case (5%) involving a 6-month-old infant, the  safety pin could not be removed although it was observed using endoscopy. No  surgical intervention was needed for any patient. No complications such as  perforation or deaths developed, except for erosions, due to the foreign body  removal procedure. CONCLUSION: Safety pins are easily removed endoscopically. The  best option is to remove the safety pin using endoscopy while it is still in the  esophagus and stomach. For this reason, endoscopic procedures should be performed  as soon as possible in children who have ingested safety pins.",10.5223/pghn.2019.22.5.441,PubMed

The patient was stabilized and taken emergently to  the operating room for exploratory laparotomy and removal of 34 cocaine packets.  Ongoing treatment for cocaine overdose was also utilized. The patient recovered  without complications. DISCUSSION: This case provides insight and awareness for  proper diagnosis and management of body packers by physicians and surgeons alike.  CONCLUSION: We present a case report of acute cocaine intoxication in a young man  who ingested 34 packets of cocaine for means of drug trafficking.

It affects millions of international travelers to developing countries annually and can significantly disrupt travel plans. Objective: To provide an update on the evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of traveler's diarrhea. Methods: A PubMed search was completed in Clinical Queries using the key term traveler's diarrhea. The search strategy included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews. The search was restricted to English literature. Patents were searched using the key term traveler's diarrhea from www.freepatentsonline.com. Results: Between 10% and 40% of travelers develop diarrhea. The attack rate is highest for travelers from a developed country who visit a developing country. Children are at particular risk. Travelers' diarrhea is usually acquired through ingestion of food and water contaminated by feces. Most cases are due to a bacterial pathogen, commonly, Escherichia coli, and occur within the first few days after arrival in a foreign country. Dehydration is the most common complication. Pretravel education on hygiene and on the safe selection of food items is important in minimizing episodes. For mild travelers' diarrhea, the use of antibiotic is not recommended. The use of bismuth subsalicylate or loperamide may be considered. For moderate travelers' diarrhea, antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, and rifaximin may be used. Loperamide may be considered as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. For severe travelers' diarrhea, antibiotics such as azithromycin, fluoroquinolones, and rifaximin should be used. Azithromycin can be used even for the treatment of dysentery whereas fluoroquinolones and rifaximin cannot be used for such purpose. Recent patents related to the management of travelers' diarrhea are discussed. Conclusion: Although travelers' diarrhea is usually self-limited, many travelers prefer expedient relief of diarrhea, especially when they are traveling for extended periods by air or ground.

Pediatric and psychiatric patients are the two most common  populations suffering from accidental or in some cases intentional ingestion of  foreign bodies. Commonly, majority of cases require no specific treatment and the  swallowed objects pass through the digestive tract spontaneously without causing  any significant complications. Less than 1% of the cases complicates with  gastrointestinal tract perforation, which are often caused by sharp objects,  which warrants surgical intervention. The average time from foreign body  ingestion to development of perforation was noted at 10.4 days in previous  reports. These cases often present in rapidly progressing peritonitis and are  subsequently managed by emergent laparotomy. In this case report, we describe an  accidental chopstick ingestion of a patient who initially was misdiagnosed and  remained asymptomatic for nine months, then presented with acute abdomen. CASE  PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old man accidentally ingested a wooden chopstick and  sought consult at a clinic. Negative abdominal plain film misled the physician to  believe ingested chopstick was digested into fragments and passed out unnoticed.  The patient presented acute abdomen caused by duodenal perforation nine months  later and was subsequently treated with emergency laparotomy with primary  duodenorrhaphy. CONCLUSIONS: Negative plain films are not sufficient to conclude  a conservative treatment in foreign body ingestion. Computed tomography scan or  endoscopic examinations should be done to rule out retained foreign body within  gastrointestinal tract.",10.1186/s12893-019-0594-5,PubMed

If the bolus does not pass spontaneously, then the patient is at risk of aspiration, dehydration, perforation, and death. Definitive management is with endoscopic intervention, recommended within 24 hours. Prior to endoscopy, many patients undergo a period of observation, awaiting spontaneous disimpaction, or may undergo enteral or parenteral treatments to attempt to dislodge the bolus. There is little consensus as to which of these conservative strategies is safe and effective to be used in this initial period, before resorting to definitive endoscopic management for persistent impaction. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of non‐endoscopic conservative treatments in the management of soft food boluses impacted within the oesophagus. Search methods We searched the following databases, using relevant search terms: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL. The date of the search was 18 August 2019. We screened the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews on the topic to identify any additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of the management of acute oesophageal soft food bolus impaction, in adults and children, reporting the incidence of disimpaction (confirmed radiologically or clinically by return to oral diet) without the need for endoscopic intervention. We did not include studies focusing on sharp or solid object impaction. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Main results We identified 890 unique records through the electronic searches. We excluded 809 clearly irrelevant records and retrieved 81 records for further assessment. We subsequently included one randomised controlled trial that met the eligibility criteria, which was conducted in four Swedish centres and randomised 43 participants to receive either intravenous diazepam followed by glucagon, or intravenous placebos. The effect of the active substances compared with placebo on rates of disimpaction without intervention is uncertain, as the numbers from this single study were small, and the rates were similar (38% versus 32%; risk ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 0.51 to 2.75, P = 0.69). The certainty of the evidence using GRADE for this outcome is low. Data on adverse events were lacking. Authors' conclusions There is currently inadequate data to recommend the use of any enteral or parenteral treatments in the management of acute oesophageal soft food bolus impaction. There is also inadequate data regarding potential adverse events from the use of these treatments, or from potential delays in definitive endoscopic management. Caution should be exercised when using any conservative management strategies in these patients. Plain language summary Use of treatments to dislodge soft foods stuck between the throat and the stomach to try to avoid the need for an endoscopy Review question Can a period of observation, treatment with swallowed substances, or treatment with substances given via the blood help to dislodge soft foods that are stuck between the throat and the stomach in order to avoid the need for an endoscopic procedure to clear it? Background Food can sometimes get stuck in the oesophagus, the pipe connecting the throat to the stomach that passes through the chest. This food often dislodges on its own, without any medical help, but occasionally a doctor's help is needed to clear it. Removing or dislodging these lumps of food can be done using a flexible camera or a rigid instrument, called an endoscope, but endoscopic procedures can have serious complications, like causing holes in the oesophagus. However, waiting for too long for the food to clear on its own can also increase the risk of a hole in the oesophagus and may lead to saliva or food falling into the lungs, causing serious infections. A variety of treatments are currently used to try to clear the food, without having to resort to an endoscopy, many of which also have potential side effects, including difficulty breathing, increased blood sugar levels, low blood pressure, and irregular heartbeat. We wanted to know if any of these treatments were better than simply waiting for the food to clear on its own, before trying to dislodge it with instruments. Study characteristics The evidence is current to August 2019. We found one trial suitable to answer our question, which compared giving a patient two drugs into a vein in (diazepam and glucagon) to placebos (clear liquids which appeared similar to the drugs but have no effect on the body). We did not look at treating sharp or hard objects, as these are treated differently. Key results There was not enough evidence to say with certainty which treatments for food impacted in the oesophagus are safe or effective. Quality of the evidence We graded the overall certainty of the evidence as low. More studies with more participants are needed to be able to answer the review question.",10.1002/14651858.cd007352.pub3,Cochrane

However, trends and patterns of adult FoBIs as well as associations with clinical comorbidities and behavioral attributes have not been elucidated beyond single institutional experiences. Methods: We utilized survey data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to examine fundamental characteristics of adult FoBIs involving consumer products between 2000 and 2017 across the United States. Data regarding the circumstances of FoBIs were abstracted from narrative data. Relationships among time, intent, demographics, and behavioral attributes were assessed using regression analyses, accounting for survey structure. Results: Adult FoBIs have increased in incidence over the past 2 decades from 3 to 5.3 per 100,000 persons. Examination of consumer products revealed that jewelry (15.4%), nails (7.2%), and toothpicks (6.9%) were the most commonly ingested products. The most common products ingested varied over time, and the number of unique consumer product categories ingested increased from 103 to 143 in the time period studied. Intentional ingestions accounted for 14% of adult FoBIs and frequently involved plastic bagging (13.6%), batteries (13%), nails (10.1%), and desk supplies (6.8%). Adjusted regression analyses demonstrated that compared with accidental FoBIs, intentional FoBIs have increased over time. Intentional FoBIs were more frequently associated with younger age, substance abuse, police custody, and mental and cognitive illnesses relative to accidental FoBIs. Conclusions: Our results indicate that adult FoBIs are an increasing burden of disease in the United States with social, psychiatric, and behavioral contributors to this trend.",10.1016/j.gie.2019.09.010,Web of Science

Mental health disorders in adolescents present some of the most challenging of all ethical dilemmas. This is particularly true when they lead to self-injurious behavior that can only be prevented by either limiting the freedom of the adolescent or forcing treatments on them that they do not want. Intentional and repeated foreign-body ingestion (FBI) in youth is a poorly understood self-injurious behavior that can be life-threatening. It poses unique clinical and ethical challenges. Ingestion of sharp or magnetic objects increases the need for endoscopic retrieval or surgical intervention with associated risks, including perforation and anesthesia-related adverse events. When behavior modification efforts fail to prevent recurrent FBI, the cumulative risk of medical intervention mounts. Sometimes, as a last resort, doctors consider surgical procedures that limit jaw movement and may physically prevent recurrent FBI. In this Ethics Rounds article, we present a case in which doctors consider whether it is in the best interest of a teenager with this behavior to undergo orthodontic jaw wiring as a next step in treatment of repeated FBI.

Only a few cases of peritonitis or intra-abdominal abscesses secondary  to perforation of the digestive tract by an ingested foreign body have been  reported. The most common sites of impaction and perforation include the  appendix, cecum and the terminal ileum. The rectum is an unusual site of foreign  body impaction. This report intends to highlight that ingested foreign body  impacted in the rectum is an extremely rare cause of perianal abscess and  subsequent fistula in infants. CASE SUMMARY: Two cases of perianal abscess and  fistula due to ingested jujube pit impacted in the rectum are reported. Both  cases are infants with free previous medical history suffered from recurrent  perianal infection. The caregivers of the two patients denied ingestion of a  foreign body or any history of trauma. Physical examination combined with  ultrasound or computed tomography scan established the diagnosis. Both of the  patients underwent operation under general anesthesia. In case 1, a jujube pit  with sharp ends was discovered embedded within a subcutaneous fistula. The jujube  pit was then removed intact along with fistula resection. The wound was  successfully laid open to allow healing by secondary intention. In case 2, a  jujube pit was found with its sharp end puncturing the rectum, surrounded by pus  and necrotic tissue. Subsequent incision and adequate drainage were performed.  The whole jujube pit was then removed from the abscess cavity at the same time.  Both patients received colonoscopy to rule out inflammatory bowel disease or  other potential damages by the ingested jujube pit. The postoperative period was  uneventful. At 1.5 year follow-up, no recurrent abscess or fistula were found in  either patient. CONCLUSION: An impacted foreign body must not be overlooked as an  unusual cause of perianal abscess and fistula, especially in young children.",10.12998/wjcc.v8.i20.4930,PubMed

The probability of injury occurrence is influenced by  agent, host and environmental factors. Studies of repeat injuries in childhood  therefore provide insight into factors in the epidemiological triad predisposing  children to injury. OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportion of children and the  factors associated with repeat presentations to the Red Cross War Memorial  Children's Hospital Trauma Unit (RCWMCH TU) in Cape Town, South Africa, for all  non-transport-related injuries in childhood. METHODS: This was a retrospective  cohort study using data from the RCWMCH TU. We included children aged 0 - 10  years with first presentation from January 1997 to June 2013 and followed up  until the earlier of age 13 years or June 2016. We assessed individual and  population-level factors associated with repeat injury using multilevel Poisson  regression analysis. Child dependency ratios were derived from the 2011 National  Census. RESULTS: Between 1997 and 2013, 72 490 children aged &lt;10 years (59%  male) presented to the RCWMCH TU for the first time with injuries. After the  initial injury, 9 417 (13%) presented with a repeat injury by 2016 and before age  13 years. After adjusting for health subdistrict, distance from RCWMCH TU and age  at first presentation, factors associated with reduced repeat presentation were  injury identified as due to abuse (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 0.6; 95%  confidence interval (CI) 0.4 - 0.7), fluid burn (aIRR 0.6; 95% CI 0.6 - 0.7),  foreign body ingestion (aIRR 0.7; 95% CI 0.7 - 0.9), and moderate and severe (v.  minor) initial injury (aIRR 0.9; 95% CI 0.8 - 0.9 and aIRR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6 - 0.8,  respectively), while boys were more likely to have repeat injury presentations  (aIRR 1.4; 95% CI 1.4 - 1.5). CONCLUSIONS: Repeat presentations were substantial  and associated with male gender. They occurred less commonly after fluid burn  injuries, foreign body ingestion and moderate to severe injuries. Children with  intentional injuries were also less likely to have a repeat presentation. Further  research is indicated for childhood injuries with greater propensity to repeat,  including non-height falls and sport-related injuries. Secondary injury  prevention education should not neglect patients with unintentional and minor  injuries. These results strengthen the hypothesis that injuries arise as a result  of sustained exposure to agent, host and environmental risk factors.",10.7196/samj.2020.v110i12.14546,PubMed

The purpose of this study was to evaluate findings at serial MRI after endoscopic removal of a button battery from the esophagus in a series of  pediatric patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Serial MRI examinations after removal  of a button battery from the esophagus were reviewed retrospectively for the  presence of mediastinal edema; imaging characteristics of the aorta and arteries;  imaging characteristics of the trachea; and imaging characteristics of the  esophageal wall at the level of injury. RESULTS. A total of 48 MRI examinations  were performed on 19 patients, 89% (17/19) in the first 48 hours after battery  removal. Serial MRI was performed for 84% (16/19) of patients. Initial MRI showed  extensive mediastinal edema in all 17 patients who underwent MRI in the first 48  hours. Edema directly abutted major arteries in all 17 patients and abutted the  airway in all 10 patients with proximal esophageal injury. Arterial vascular  changes were seen in 30% (3/10) of patients with proximal esophageal injury and  57% (4/7) of patients with mid or distalesophageal injury. Airway changes were  seen in 80% (8/10) of patients with proximal esophageal injury. Serial MRI showed  improvement of airway changes in all patients and improvement in vessel wall  changes in all but one (25%, 1/4) of the patients who had mid or distal  esophageal injury. Four patients (21% [4/19]) had contained esophageal leak on  esophagrams. No patients in our series developed a tracheoesophageal or  vascular-enteric fistula. CONCLUSION.

METHODS: Medical records of 74  pediatric patients from 9 large Chinese hospitals during the past 10 years, who  were diagnosed as buckyball magnets ingestion and got invasive treatment, were  retrospectively studied. The follow-up was through telephone and outpatient  service to estimate the post-surgery condition. Information collection was  through online questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the 74 cases, there were 50 boys  (68%) and 24 girls (32%). The median age was 36 (interquartile range (IQR) 22-77)  months, with a range of 7 months to 11 years, and it showed two peaks, the first  between 1 and 3 years, and the second between 6 to 11 years. The annual case  number showed a sharp increase over time, and the total case number in the last  2 years (2017 and 2018) showed a greater than 9-fold increase when compared with  the first 2 years (2013 and 2014). The majority of ingestions were unintentional,  with only 3 patients deliberately swallowing the Buckyball magnets. The median  time of ingestion until the onset of emergent symptoms was 2 (IQR 1-5) days, and  ranged from 4 h to 40 days. Twenty-one patients had no symptoms, and the  remaining cases presented with abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, abdominal  distension, excessive crying, melena, and the ceasing of flatus and defecation.  Gastroscopy, colonoscopy, laparoscopic surgery and laparotomy surgery were  performed in accordance with the algorithm from the North American Society of  Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN).

The aortic injury caused by a perforating esophageal foreign  body is rare but lethal. The optimal management still remains controversial. The  purpose of this report is to describe our experience in the management of the  aortic injury caused by esophageal foreign body ingestion. METHODS: Between  January 2015 and December 2015, we retrospectively enrolled cases of esophageal  perforation involving the aorta by foreign body.

RESULTS: Group  A consisted of 77 prisoners, 2 suspects and 11 psychologically disabled persons.  Group B consisted of 1020 patients with no prisoners, suspects or psychologically  disabled persons. In Group A, there were no food-related foreign bodies, and the  majority of FBs were metallic objects (54.44%). However in Group B, food-related  FBs were the most common (91.37%). In Group A, 58 cases (64.44%) were located in  the stomach, while in Group B, 893 cases (87.55%) were located in the esophagus  (P < 0.05). 1096 patients successfully underwent endoscopic removal and 14  failed, including 9 cases in Group A and 5 cases in Group B. The duration of FBs  impaction was longer in Group A than that in Group B (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In  our study, the patients who intentionally ingested FB were mainly prisoners, FBs  were mostly sharp metallic objects, the duration of FBs impaction was longer, and  the rate of successful endoscopic treatment was lower than that of the general  population. Attention should be focused on these patients.",10.1186/s12876-020-01224-z,PubMed

Z.; Shokhaydarov, Sh I.",Pediatric Surgery International,Cylindrical and button battery ingestion in children: a single-center experience,"PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to perform a comparative analysis of the examination and treatment outcomes of children with cylindrical and button  batteries (BB) ingestion depending on their size and anatomical locations.  METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of 124 children aged from  1 month to 18 years who ingested batteries and were treated in a tertiary care  center from January 1, 2014 to March 31, 2019. The data studied included age,  sex, presenting symptoms at the time of evaluation, type and size of battery and  modality of management. RESULTS: Twenty-three (18.5%) patients ingested  cylindrical batteries (CBs), and 101 (81.5%) ingested BBs. The duration of  hospital stay was significantly longer (p = 0.004) in the group of children who  ingested BBs larger than 20 mm. Endoscopic removal was performed in 75 (60.5%)  children, 46 (37.1%) were followed up and three (2.4%) underwent open surgeries.  Children with CBs ingestion, in 55% of cases, had gastric mucosal injuries.  Children with BBs impacted in the esophagus in 96% cases had visible severe  mucosal damage, whereas patients with gastric BB ingestion 19.5% had superficial  gastric mucosal damage. CONCLUSION: Performing timely endoscopic retrieval in  children who are admitted early to the hospital will reduce the risk of damage to  the gastrointestinal mucosa, especially in the stomach. Unlike BBs, CBs, despite  their large size, have advantageous shapes, uneventfully pass the esophagus and  are more often retained in the stomach; thus, mucosal injuries are more often  observed in the stomach. Consequently, endoscopic extraction is the treatment of  choice for children with BB ingestion.",10.1007/s00383-021-04953-8,PubMed

History and physical examination are commonly not enough to diagnose a foreign  body ingestion; therefore, conventional radiography is routinely used to detect  them. Point-of-care ultrasound is widely used in the emergency department for  several diagnostic applications but there are few articles describing the  possibility to use point-of-care ultrasound to detect ingested foreign bodies,  and the necessary training to get competent in this application. The main  objective of this paper is to illustrate the use of point-of-care ultrasound  (POCUS) to detect ingested foreign bodies. The secondary objective is to describe  a limited training, necessary for emergency pediatricians, to obtain this skill.  METHODS: This is a case series of eight pediatric patients who presented to the  pediatric Emergency Department (ED), with suspected ingestion of FB, and were  assessed with POCUS. Physician sonographers were two pediatricians and three  residents in pediatrics working in two Italian Pediatric EDs. All sonographers  participated in a 2-day POCUS workshop which included the most common pediatric  POCUS applications. RESULTS: POCUS, performed by emergency pediatricians who  participated to a limited training, allowed to always identify the foreign bodies  ingested. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that an appropriate and limited training  allows pediatric emergency physicians to correctly identify foreign body in the  esophagus or stomach. Point-of-care ultrasound in foreign body ingestion in the  Emergency Department may allow to prioritize the escalation of care in children  and it can contribute to reduce the time to endoscopic management when needed.",10.1007/s40477-020-00452-z,PubMed

Its origin comes from embryonic cells of the notochord and it is a unipotent tumor. Pyometra is the accumulation of purulent content in the uterine lumen. Cystic endometrial hyperplasia is one of the factors predisposing a dog to the development of pyometra. The safest and most efficient treatment for pyometra is ovariohysterectomy. The purpose of this report was to describe a case of ovarian teratoma and cystic endometrial hyperplasia with concomitant pyometra in a Labrador Retriever Bitch. Case: A 10-year-old bitch Labrador Retriever, weighing 42 kg, was evaluated at Animal Care Barueri Veterinary Clinic, in Barueri, Sao Paulo. The patient was referred from another veterinary service to our clinic for an ovariohysterectomy and removal of an intestinal foreign body as previous ultrasonography (US) had indicated the presence of pyometra and a foreign body in the descending colon (she had ingested cloth according to the owner's report). Laboratory tests, complete blood count, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, urea, and creatinine levels did not show any significant changes. Upon examination, the clinical signs were mucopurulent vaginal discharge, 5% dehydration, rectal temperature 39.1 degrees C, mild abdominal pain on palpation, normophagy, normodipsia, and normal defecation and urination. Laboratory tests and a new US were requested on which the uterus was observed with the presence of luminal anechoic content and increased uterine diameter (uterine horns 3.97 cm), an acoustic intestinal shadow supposedly from a foreign body, and on the leukogram, leukocytosis (23,600/mm3) due to neutrophilia with a right shift (20,532/mm3) was observed. Therapeutic ovariohysterectomy and exploratory celiotomy were chosen as therapeutic options. Celiotomy with caudoumbilical mid ventral access was performed. When the left uterine horn was identified, an attempt was made to pull it in order to expose the left ovary, but this maneuver was not successful. For this reason, the abdominal incision was enlarged cranially. At that point, a huge mass was observed in the ovary (which was supposedly the acoustic shadow of the foreign body in the descending colon/left ovary). The intestines appeared normal. Macroscopically, the mass had an irregular surface, round shape, firm consistency, and was 15 cm long x 10 cm wide. Once removed, the mass was incised in the transversal direction, purulent content, hair, and mineralized areas inside it were observed. Histopathological examination showed neoplastic proliferation, consisting of cells with elongated epithelioid shape that were arranged in long irregular bundles among well-differentiated adipose tissue. An exuberant eosinophilic matrix with extensive cystic areas filled with lamellar keratin and hairy stems covered by squamous epithelium was also observed. Extensive areas exhibiting nervous tissue with minimal atypia are shown. The morphological picture was compatible with teratoma. Discussion: The present report describes the concomitant presence of ovarian teratoma and pyometra in a dog. The diagnosis of pyometra requires complementary tests (laboratory and imaging). The intestinal acoustic shadow observed on the two US images obtained by two different professionals was suggestive of intestinal foreign body but was also a wrong diagnosis, which was confirmed after an exploratory celiotomy when the mass in the left ovary was identified. On the histopathological examination of this present case, epithelial, nervous, and cartilaginous tissues were observed. This differentiation of tissues corroborated the teratoma diagnosis. Thus, the importance of an accurate diagnosis contributes to the resolution of a surgical conditions that may have had a poor prognosis when the procedure took a longer time to perform.",10.22456/1679-9216.112127,Web of Science

Bowel perforation by foreign body ingestion has been believed to be relatively rare, and most commonly caused by fish bones, chicken bones, and toothpicks. Our clinical experience, however, suggests such perforations may be more common than previously thought, and caused by various other objects as well. Medical records of all patients diagnosed with foreign body-induced intestinal perforation, from the Department of General Surgery at Tonji Hospital, from January 2000 to June 2015, were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 17 men and 8 women suffered intestinal perforations by ingestion of dietary foreign bodies. Among the 25 total patients, 4 ingested foreign bodies intentionally, whereas the other 21 cases were accidental. The foreign bodies were identified by plain X-ray film in 2 patients (2 cases of needles) and by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in 11 patients (6 cases of date stones, 3 cases of metallic objects, and 2 cases of bone fragments), thus supporting the correct preoperative diagnosis (13 cases; 52%). The most common location of the perforation was the terminal ileum (n = 17). The offending objects were date stones (n = 13), bones (n = 7), and metallic objects (n = 5). The most common treatment was removal of the foreign body and closure of the perforation with simple suture (n = 22). Ten patients were treated laparoscopically. The present study shows that the most common foreign bodies causing intestinal perforation are date stones and bones. Although about 50% of the foreign bodies could be identified by MDCT, definite diagnosis remained preoperatively difficult. Consequently, because of high misdiagnosis rates, laparoscopy may be the optimal choice for diagnosis and treatment of bowel perforation by foreign bodies.",10.9738/intsurg-d-15-00303.1,Web of Science

Risk  factors for RIFB ingestion include male sex, incarceration, and the presence of a  psychiatric disorder. Most patients can be managed with observation and  endoscopy. Surgery is indicated in cases involving perforation or obstruction.  The literature on preventative strategies for RIFB ingestion is scarce. CASE  REPORT A 23-year-old man required 6 admissions in 1 calendar year for intentional  foreign body ingestions. The patient was living in prison and had a history of  bipolar I disorder, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. He  underwent 9 endoscopic procedures that retrieved a total of 64 objects. The  primary imaging modalities were abdominal X-ray and abdominopelvic  contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan. The patient was managed with  endoscopy and, in 2 cases, with observation alone. Serial abdominal examinations  and abdominal films were used to monitor the progress of foreign bodies that were  difficult to retrieve. A bowel regimen with polyethylene glycol facilitated the  passage of the objects. The patient never required surgical intervention. The  mean length of stay was 4.17 days. The recurrent ingestions may have been related  to compulsions and family stress. CONCLUSIONS Interdisciplinary collaboration is  paramount in formulating effective treatment plans and limiting recurrence.  Proposed strategies to prevent RIFB ingestion include the removal of ingestible  objects from the environment, specialized prison units for close monitoring,  early psychiatric intervention with appropriate pharmacologic/behavioral therapy,  and limiting hospital admissions to prevent secondary gain. Further studies are  needed to determine the most effective approach to manage and prevent RIFB  ingestion.",10.12659/ajcr.934164,PubMed

Delay in their diagnosis and treatment may  significantly increase morbidity and mortality. Causes of esophageal injury  include iatrogenic (including esophagogastroduodenoscopy and stent placement),  foreign body ingestion, blunt or penetrating trauma to the chest or abdomen, and  forceful retching, also called Boerhaave syndrome. Although fluoroscopic  esophagography remains the imaging study of choice according the American College  of Radiology appropriateness criteria, CT esophagography has been shown to be at  least equal to if not superior to fluoroscopic evaluation for esophageal injury.  In addition, CT esophagography allows diagnosis of extraesophageal abnormalities,  both as the cause of the patient's symptoms as well as incidental findings. CT  esophagography also allows rapid diagnosis since the examination can be readily  performed in most clinical settings and requires no direct radiologist  supervision, requiring only properly trained technologists and a CT scanner.  Multiple prior studies have shown the limited utility of fluoroscopic  esophagography after a negative chest CT scan and the increase in accuracy after  adding oral contrast agent to CT examinations, although there is considerable  variability of CT esophagography protocols among institutions. Development of a  CT esophagography program, utilizing a well-defined protocol with input from  staff from the radiology, gastroenterology, emergency, and general surgery  departments, can facilitate more rapid diagnosis and patient care, especially in  overnight and emergency settings.

The purpose of our study was to determine the optimal protocol  for radiographic survey post-coin ingestion. We hypothesized that for children  presenting with a clear history of coin ingestion a frontal chest radiograph  including the entire esophagus is adequate to guide treatment. METHODS: We  reviewed the clinical history and radiographic surveys of 134 patients presenting  with suspected or witnessed coin ingestion to the emergency department of a  tertiary care pediatric hospital between January 2012 and June 2016. Patient  demographics, presenting symptoms, anatomic coverage of survey, type, number and  location of radiopaque foreign bodies, intervention, and follow-up were recorded.  RESULTS: Coins were identified on radiographic surveys in 109 of 134 patients; 25  of 134 patients had no coin. Of those with coins, none of 109 had coin(s) in the  airway, 42 of 109 had coin(s) in the esophagus, and 67 of 109 had coin(s) distal  to the esophagus. Of those with esophageal coins, 35 of 42 reported symptoms, 7  of 42 were asymptomatic, 40 of 42 underwent endoscopic coin removal, and 2 of 42  had no intervention.

Methods A retrospective analysis of data of  all the patients who underwent endoscopic management for foreign body removal by  a single surgeon in a tertiary care hospital in southern India between 2015 and  2020 was conducted. Patient variables in terms of age, sex, type of foreign body,  its location in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the time between ingestion and  presentation, the time between presentation and endoscopy, treatment outcomes  were reviewed. Results A total of 97 patients were studied. The age range of the  patients studied was one month to 71 years. Males were predominant (n=64,  65.97%). The most common retrieved foreign body were coins (n=31, 31.9%). The  most common site of foreign body lodgment was the esophagus (n=75, 77.31%), with  the upper third esophagus (n=38; 39.37%) being the predominant site. The success  rate of endoscopic retrieval in our study was 97%. No procedure-related  complications were encountered in any patient. Endoscopic management failed in  two patients who ultimately required surgical intervention. Conclusion Endoscopic  retrieval of foreign bodies in the UGI tract is a safe and effective modality.  Early endoscopy in such patients avoids surgical intervention and reduces  morbidity.",10.7759/cureus.19293,PubMed

We aimed to analyze the different etiologies and clinical characteristics of acute  non-traumatic colon perforation beyond the neonatal period and to identify  surgical management and outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective study included 18  patients admitted with acute colon perforation and who received surgical  treatment. RESULTS: Age of patients ranged between 1 month and 15 years. Five  patients swallowed foreign objects (two swallowed magnets), two had colon  perforation secondary to a malignant tumor (both colorectal adenocarcinoma) and  two were iatrogenic (one prior colonoscopy, one air enema for intussusception).  There was one perforation due to chemotherapy and Amyand's hernia respectively.  The remaining seven patients had unknown etiologies; five of them were diagnosed  with colitis. Fifteen (83.3 %) patients underwent open laparotomy, among which  four attempted laparoscopy first. Three (16.7 %) patients underwent laparoscopic  surgery. Fourteen (77.8 %) patients received simple suture repairs and four  (22.2 %) received colonic resections and anastomosis. Four (22.2 %) patients  received a protective diverting colostomy and three (16.7 %) received an  ileostomy. CONCLUSIONS: There is a wide range of etiology besides necrotizing  enterocolitis and trauma, but a significant portion of children present with  unknown etiology. Type of surgery elected should be dependent on the patient's  etiology, disease severity and experience of surgeons.",10.1186/s12893-021-01213-3,PubMed

Compared with smooth edged FBs, sharp objects are more likely to be associated with significant adverse events, when penetrating the wall of the digestive tract. The clinical features of patients who experienced sharp-pointed FBs embedded in both sides of the duodenum were retrospectively analyzed, as were the efficacy and safety of endoscopic removal of these FBs. Patients and Methods: This retrospective study included 21 adults with both sides of sharp-pointed FBs embedded into the duodenal wall who were admitted to the Second Xiangya Hospital in China between January 1, 1996, and May 31, 2021. Data associated with the endoscopic removal of these FBs were collected from the electronic medical record system (EMRS) of the hospital. Results: The incidence rate of duodenal total FBs and FBs embedded in both sides was 8.87% and 1.03%, respectively. The success rate of endoscopic treatment was 100.00% in 124 patients without embedded duodenal FBs and 97.14% in 35 patients with one side embedded duodenal FBs. Of the 21 patients with FBs embedded in both sides of the duodenal wall, endoscopic removal was successful in 85.71% of patients, whereas 14.29% required surgery. FBs removed from these patients included toothpicks in 12; needles in 3; jujube pits in 2; and a chopstick, dentures, fish bones, and chicken bones in one each. Most of these 21 FBs were located in the bulb and descending duodenum, followed by the third part of duodenum. Conclusion: Sharp-edged FBs with both sides embedded in the duodenal wall are rare. Endoscopic removal may be considered as a feasible, safe, and effective method of removing sharp-pointed FBs with both sides embedded in the duodenal wall.

A PubMed and Google Scholar search  discovered a variety of case reports detailing various methods and indications  for endoscopic retrieval of right sided colonic foreign bodies. This case report  endeavors to supplement the literature so that guidelines can one day be  established for colonoscopic retrieval of right-sided foreign bodies. CASE  PRESENTATION: 36-year-old male prisoner swallowed 6.5 cm nail clippers with a  long-standing history of intentional foreign body ingestion (FBI) including  multiple laparotomies for foreign body retrievals. Computerized tomography (CT)  was used initially to confirm the position of the nail clippers. After almost two  weeks of failure of the foreign body (FB) to move beyond the caecum as  demonstrated on plain abdominal X-rays, the patient had a colonoscopy with  successful retrieval of the FB. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: This case report hopes to  encourage the consideration of colonoscopy for retrieval of right sided colonic  foreign bodies that have failed to pass on their own and where an operation may  come with increased risk (multiple laparotomies, multiple comorbidities, and  higher anaesthetic risk for a general anaesthetic). Colonoscopy/endoscopy still  has inherent risk and this patient did have an episode of temporary laryngospasm  that required intubation and monitoring in the intensive care unit post  operatively. Despite this the patient recovered and was discharged day one post  procedure without further complication. The case report has been reported in line  with the SCARE 2020 criteria (Agha et al., 2020 [2]).

Our objective was to evaluate the  guidelines' impact on in-hospital resource utilization and short-term clinical  outcomes in hemodynamically stable patients after endoscopic battery removal.  METHODS: A single-center retrospective review of all EBBI admissions from 2010 to  2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on adoption of national  guidelines: pre-guideline (2010-2015) and post-guideline (2016-2020). RESULTS:  Sixty-five patients were studied (pre-guideline n = 23; post-guideline n = 42).  Compared with pre-guideline, post-guideline use of magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) increased (2/23 [8.7%]; 30/42 [71.4%]; p < 0.001). Post-guideline increases  resulted for median days (IQR) receiving antibiotics (0 [0, 4]; 6 [3, 8];  p = 0.01), total pediatric intensive care unit admission (0 [0, 1]; 3 [0, 6];  p < 0.001), and total hospital length of stay (5 [2, 11]; 11.5 [4, 17];  p = 0.02).

In adults, intentional foreign body ingestion  is frequently observed among individuals with psychiatric disorders and  prisoners. Controversies exist regarding the management of sharp or pointed  objects. We contribute to this existing controversy by presenting a case of a  43-year-old male who accidently ingested a metallic screw and was managed  successfully through endoscopic retrieval. CASE PRESENTATION: We discuss a case  of a 43-year-old male presented to our emergency department after accidently  swallowing a metallic screw, 1 h and a half prior to his presentation. He was  initially asymptomatic then started to complain of vague abdominal symptoms.  X-rays of the chest and abdomen demonstrated the presence of a metallic screw at  the mid-abdomen. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen then confirmed its  presence within the gastric lumen, with no evidence of gastric or bowel  perforation. The patient was managed via esophagogastroduodenoscopy in which the  ingested screw was extracted. He was discharged after 24 hours in a good  condition. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: A limited number of epidemiological studies have  shed light on the prevalence and incidence of foreign body ingestion among adult  individuals. Probability of spontaneous passage depends on several factors  including the size, shape and composition of the impacted item, as well as the  age of patient and duration of ingestion prior to presentation. CONCLUSION:  Considering the variation of ingested objects and the availability of several  therapeutic approaches, a patient-tailored management plan should always be  established.",10.1016/j.amsu.2022.104944,PubMed

Mostly FBs are found ingested accidently or intentionally in children and adults with mental  status alterations. Depending on the type of object, different complications can  occur. There exist numerous methods for removing each specific FB. Fortunately,  most FBs tend to move uneventfully through the gastrointestinal tract without any  intervention; but managing some foreign objects can be difficult and lead to  severe complications. Endoscopy helps with the diagnosis and treatment of these  cases, but the time of the management plays an important role. CASE PRESENTATION:  A 26-year-old female who intentionally swallowed two sewing needles, presented to  our emergency department with abdominal pain two months after the FB ingestion.  One of the sewing needles was spontaneously excreted through the bowel, and the  other was present in her body for two months. The FB had penetrated the stomach  and migrated to the peritoneal cavity. The patient's condition was managed by  laparoscopic removal of the FB and repair of the damaged tissue. According to the  traumatic nature of the needle to abdominal viscera, and standing outside the GI  tract on the pancreas surface, laparoscopic removal of the foreign metallic body  was chosen to be performed. No complication was seen during the postoperative  period. CONCLUSION: This report emphasizes the importance of prompt evaluation of  FB patients and finding the appropriate method of managing its complications.  Preventing complications requires focusing on symptoms and instant management of  the ingested FBs.",10.1016/j.amsu.2022.104747,PubMed
2022,"Daly, B.","Daly, BJM; Sharif, MO; Jones, K; Worthington, HV; Beattie, A",Cochrane Database Of Systematic Reviews,Local interventions for the management of alveolar osteitis dry socket,"Abstract - Background Alveolar osteitis (dry socket) is a complication of dental extractions more often involving mandibular molar teeth. It is associated with severe pain developing 2 to 3 days postoperatively with or without halitosis, a socket that may be partially or totally devoid of a blood clot, and increased postoperative visits. This is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2012.  Objectives To assess the effects of local interventions used for the prevention and treatment of alveolar osteitis (dry socket) following tooth extraction. Search methods An Information Specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 28 September 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of adults over 18 years of age who were having permanent teeth extracted or who had developed dry socket postextraction. We included studies with any type of local intervention used for the prevention or treatment of dry socket, compared to a different local intervention, placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies reporting on systemic use of antibiotics or the use of surgical techniques because these interventions are evaluated in separate Cochrane Reviews. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We followed Cochrane statistical guidelines and reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random‐effects models. For some of the split‐mouth studies with sparse data, it was not possible to calculate RR so we calculated the exact odds ratio (OR) instead. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the body of evidence. Main results We included 49 trials with 6771 participants; 39 trials (with 6219 participants) investigated prevention of dry socket and 10 studies (with 552 participants) looked at the treatment of dry socket. 16 studies were at high risk of bias, 30 studies at unclear risk of bias, and 3 studies at low risk of bias. Chlorhexidine in the prevention of dry socket When compared to placebo, rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthrinses (0.12% and 0.2% concentrations) both before and 24 hours after extraction(s) substantially reduced the risk of developing dry socket with an OR of 0.38 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.58; P < 0.00001; 6 trials, 1547 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The prevalence of dry socket varies from 1% to 5% in routine dental extractions to upwards of 30% in surgically extracted third molars. The number of patients needed to be treated (NNT) with chlorhexidine rinse to prevent one patient having dry socket was 162 (95% CI 155 to 240), 33 (95% CI 27 to 49), and 7 (95% CI 5 to 10) for control prevalence of dry socket 0.01, 0.05, and 0.30 respectively.  Compared to placebo, placing chlorhexidine gel intrasocket after extractions reduced the odds of developing a dry socket by 58% with an OR of 0.44 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.71; P = 0.0008; 7 trials, 753 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The NNT with chlorhexidine gel (0.2%) to prevent one patient developing dry socket was 180 (95% CI 137 to 347), 37 (95% CI 28 to 72), and 7 (95% CI 5 to 15) for control prevalence of dry socket of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.30 respectively. Compared to chlorhexidine rinse (0.12%), placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2%) intrasocket after extractions was not superior in reducing the risk of dry socket (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.20; P = 0.22; 2 trials, 383 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  The present review found some evidence for the association of minor adverse reactions with use of 0.12%, 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthrinses (alteration in taste, staining of teeth, stomatitis) though most studies were not designed explicitly to detect the presence of hypersensitivity reactions to mouthwash as part of the study protocol. No adverse events were reported in relation to the use of 0.2% chlorhexidine gel placed directly into a socket. Platelet rich plasma in the prevention of dry socket  Compared to placebo, placing platelet rich plasma after extractions was not superior in reducing the risk of having a dry socket (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.33; P = 0.17; 2 studies, 127 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).  A further 21 intrasocket interventions to prevent dry socket were each evaluated in single studies, and there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects. Zinc oxide eugenol versus Alvogyl in the treatment of dry socket Two studies, with 80 participants, showed that Alvogyl (old formulation) is more effective than zinc oxide eugenol at reducing pain at day 7 (mean difference (MD) ‐1.40, 95% CI ‐1.75 to ‐1.04; P < 0.00001; 2 studies, 80 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) A further nine interventions for the treatment of dry socket were evaluated in single studies, providing insufficient evidence to determine their effects. Authors' conclusions Tooth extractions are generally undertaken by dentists for a variety of reasons, however, all but five studies included in the present review included participants undergoing extraction of third molars, most of which were undertaken by oral surgeons. There is moderate‐certainty evidence that rinsing with chlorhexidine (0.12% and 0.2%) or placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2%) in the sockets of extracted teeth, probably results in a reduction in dry socket. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of the other 21 preventative interventions each evaluated in single studies. There was limited evidence of very low certainty that Alvogyl (old formulation) may reduce pain at day 7 in patients with dry socket when compared to zinc oxide eugenol.  Plain language summary What treatments can be used to prevent and treat alveolar osteitis (dry socket)?  Key messages ‐ Rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthwash before a dental extraction or beginning 24 hours after may help to prevent a dry socket. ‐ Placing a chlorhexidine gel directly into the socket immediately after tooth extraction may help to prevent a dry socket. ‐ Chlorhexidine rinses cause some minor adverse (unwanted) effects; chlorhexidine intrasocket gels do not appear to cause adverse effects. ‐ Alvogyl reduces the pain of a dry socket when compared to zinc oxide eugenol, but the evidence for this is very uncertain. ‐ Alvogyl does not appear to cause unwanted effects. ‐ We need future studies to strengthen the evidence and investigate the best ways to prevent and treat dry socket in all teeth. What is dry socket? Dry socket is a painful condition that sometimes arises after a tooth has been extracted and is more likely to occur following extraction of wisdom teeth in the lower jaw. What causes dry socket? It is thought to be linked to the loss of some or all of the blood clot that forms at the bottom of a tooth socket after a tooth is taken out. How can we prevent dry socket? An option for prevention of dry socket is to reduce debris and the bacterial load in the mouth, though dry socket is not bacterial in origin. People with poor oral hygiene (food debris and plaque) are at greater risk of dry socket. Improved oral hygiene and rinsing before a dental extraction or beginning 24 hours after may reduce the likelihood of dry socket. How can we treat dry socket ? Options for treating dry socket largely focus on reducing pain locally around the tooth extraction site by placing an obtundent (a soothing medicated dressing). What did we want to find out ? We wanted to find out if antiseptic rinses, gels, or healing patches could help to prevent dry socket. We also wanted to find out if placing a medicated dressing could treat a dry socket and whether any unwanted side effects were produced. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared antiseptic rinses or intrasocket gels with a placebo (dummy) rinse or nothing and a placebo (dummy) intrasocket gel or nothing. To find the best way to treat dry socket we searched for studies that compared different soothing agents with a placebo (dummy) with other soothing agents or with nothing. We compared the results of the studies and summarised the findings. We made an assessment of our confidence in the evidence based on the design of the study and the number of patients recruited. What did we find? We identified 49 trials; 39 trials (6219 participants) investigated prevention of dry socket and 10 trials (552 participants) investigated the treatment of dry socket. We found that: ‐ rinsing both before and after tooth extraction (commencing 24 hours after extraction) with chlorhexidine gluconate rinse (at 0.12% and 0.2% strength) probably results in a reduction in dry socket; ‐ placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2% strength) in the socket of an extracted tooth probably results in a reduction in dry socket; ‐ chlorhexidine rinses and gels are equally effective at reducing dry socket, but the evidence for this comparison is very uncertain; ‐ chlorhexidine rinses produced some minor unwanted effects; chlorhexidine intrasocket gels appeared to produce no unwanted effects; ‐ there was a small amount of evidence of very low certainty from two studies that Alvogyl (old formulation) may reduce pain at day 7 in patients with dry socket when compared to zinc oxide eugenol. This evidence relates to the old formulation of Alvogyl which is no longer available. It should be noted that the formulation of Alvogyl has changed, it is now called Alveogyl.  Tooth extractions are generally undertaken by dentists for a variety of reasons, however, all but five studies included in the present review included participants undergoing extraction of third molars, most of which were undertaken by oral surgeons.  What are the limitations of the evidence? The main limitation of the evidence are that studies: ‐ reported mostly on tooth extractions involving lower wisdom teeth; ‐ were undertaken in ways that introduced errors in the conduct of the study leading to errors in the results; and ‐ produced imprecise results when they were combined. Due to these errors we have some confidence in the results relating to chlorhexidine rinses and gels but further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. How up to date is this evidence? The search for existing studies was completed by 28 September 2021.",10.1002/14651858.cd006968.pub3,Cochrane
2022,"Ghahremani, G.","Ghahremani, Gary G.; Richman, Katherine M.",Emergency Radiology,Accidental or intentional ingestion of toothbrushes: experience with 8 adult patients,"PURPOSE: Ingestion of a toothbrush is an unusual event but may occur either accident or by intent. Radiological examinations play a crucial role in  determining the exact location of the object within the gastrointestinal tract  and in planning for its removal by endoscopic or surgical intervention. METHODS:  Medical and radiological records of 8 patients who had swallowed the broken heads  or entire toothbrush were retrospectively reviewed. This series included 4 men  and 4 women, ranging in age from 21 to 57 years (mean: 34 years). RESULTS:  Radiographs and computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated the ingested  toothbrushes within the stomach in 3, lodged in the duodenum in 1, and entrapped  in various parts of the colon in 4 patients. They were removed by laparotomy in  3, laparoscopy in 2, colonoscopy in 2, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in 1  patient. There were no perforations or associated complications, and all patients  had uneventful recoveries. CONCLUSIONS: Ingested toothbrushes can be easily  identified on radiological studies because of the radiopaque wires holding the  nylon bristles. The plastic parts of it, however, are only visible on computed  tomography. All cases would require endoscopic or surgical removal of the  retained toothbrushes because spontaneous passage per rectum does not occur.",10.1007/s10140-021-02009-x,PubMed

Although the current view suggests that endovascular stent-graft treatment is  useful for AEF, whether a subsequent thoracic operation is necessary remains  controversial. The purpose of this report is to describe our experience using  endovascular stent-graft treatment without combined thoracic operations for the  treatment of AEF in two specific cases. CASE SUMMARY: We presented two cases of  patients complaining of retrosternal discomfort treated in our department for an  aortoesophageal fistula caused by the accidental ingestion of a fishbone. The two  patients were effectively managed with combined means of endoscopic, medical  (broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, fasting, gastrointestinal decompression,  etc.) and endovascular stent-graft treatment. The main difference in treatment  was that the first patient presented with hematemesis after endoscopic removal of  the fishbone. Subsequently, the patient underwent endovascular stent-graft  treatment. The second case was managed with endoscopic removal of the fishbone  with simultaneous endovascular stent-graft treatment, without any signs of  hematemesis or melena. Both patients had successful postoperative management and  were discharged home. Long-term follow-up is ongoing. CONCLUSION: The treatment  decision-making process should depend on the patients' specific situations. Our  practice indicates that endovascular stent-graft treatment without combined  thoracic operations could be a valuable alternative in selected patients.",10.12998/wjcc.v10.i7.2206,PubMed

We aimed to demonstrate the association between the corrosion of lithium button batteries in the esophagus on radiographs and their complications. Methods The nine pediatric patients included in this study were classified into two groups based on the presence of severe complications. The presence and degree of corrosion on plain radiographs were evaluated. The degree of corrosion was classified into the following three grades; none: 0%; moderate: 1-50%; severe: 51-100%. Fisher's exact test was used for statistical analyses. Results Of the nine patients, five showed complications. The number of patients who had grade none, moderate, and severe degrees of corrosion was three, four, and two, respectively. The incidence of severe complications differed significantly between the incidence of lithium button batteries' contour (without vs. with severe complications [presence/absence of corrosion] = 1/3 vs. 5/0, respectively; P = 0.0476). In cases with none degree of corrosion, all three cases had no complication, and in cases with a severe degree of corrosion, all two cases had complications. Conclusion The cases with the presence of corrosion of lithium button batteries had a higher tendency to have severe complications. Therefore, physicians should anticipate the presence of severe complications in pediatric patients with corrosion more than those without corrosion.",10.1007/s10140-022-02033-5,Web of Science

Sodium-glucose  cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor has become one of the most common causes of  EDKA. We present one of the lowest presenting blood glucose levels for the EDKA  in the setting of SGLT2 inhibitor use. A 34-year-old female with a two-year  history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) presented after accidental ingestion  of a metal clip and lack of oral intake for 28 hours. She reported a recent  intentional weight loss of 60 lbs. She takes metformin 1000 mg twice daily and  empagliflozin 25 mg daily. An urgent endoscopy was planned in the intensive care  unit given the proximal location of the foreign body. The basic metabolic profile  after the procedure demonstrated a glucose level of 75 mg/dL, bicarbonate level  of 11 mmol/L, and AG of 17 mmol/L. The venous pH was 7.27 with a partial pressure  of carbon dioxide of 30 mmHg. The urinalysis showed a glucose level greater than  500 μmol/L with a ketone level of 80 μmol/L. The blood and urine toxicology  screening results were unremarkable. The patient was treated for EDKA with the  administration of intravenous (IV) dextrose 5% in water with subsequent  initiation of IV insulin. The assessment of her insulin reserve revealed a low  C-peptide of 0.36 ng/mL, a high glutamic acid decarboxylase level greater than  250 IU/mL, and high zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) antibodies of 42 U/mL, consistent  with an undiagnosed transition to latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).  The blood glucose levels for previously reported cases remain between 90 and 250  mg/dL. In this case, the combination of a low carbohydrate diet and prolonged  starvation may have led to the impressively low glucose. Additionally, the SGLT2  inhibitor use in patients with LADA serves as one of the known risk factors for  EDKA. EDKA poses a diagnostic challenge, especially in the ICU setting where  there exists a myriad of causes for high AG metabolic acidosis. Additionally,  many of the ICU patients are in a ketotic state brought on by prolonged  starvation. Therefore, prompt diagnosis and treatment for EDKA require careful  history taking and complete investigation for other causes of high AG metabolic  acidosis.",10.7759/cureus.24016,PubMed

They can be associated with an impaired skin barrier in early infancy. It is unclear whether trying to prevent or reverse an impaired skin barrier soon after birth is effective for preventing eczema or food allergy. Objectives Primary objective To assess the effects of skin care interventions such as emollients for primary prevention of eczema and food allergy in infants. Secondary objective To identify features of study populations such as age, hereditary risk, and adherence to interventions that are associated with the greatest treatment benefit or harm for both eczema and food allergy. Search methods We performed an updated search of the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in September 2021. We searched two trials registers in July 2021. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and scanned conference proceedings to identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).  Selection criteria We included RCTs of skin care interventions that could potentially enhance skin barrier function, reduce dryness, or reduce subclinical inflammation in healthy term (> 37 weeks) infants (≤ 12 months) without pre‐existing eczema, food allergy, or other skin condition. Eligible comparisons were standard care in the locality or no treatment. Types of skin care interventions could include moisturisers/emollients; bathing products; advice regarding reducing soap exposure and bathing frequency; and use of water softeners. No minimum follow‐up was required. Data collection and analysis This is a prospective individual participant data (IPD) meta‐analysis. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, and primary analyses used the IPD dataset. Primary outcomes were cumulative incidence of eczema and cumulative incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig)E‐mediated food allergy by one to three years, both measured at the closest available time point to two years. Secondary outcomes included adverse events during the intervention period; eczema severity (clinician‐assessed); parent report of eczema severity; time to onset of eczema; parent report of immediate food allergy; and allergic sensitisation to food or inhalant allergen. Main results We identified 33 RCTs comprising 25,827 participants. Of these, 17 studies randomising 5823 participants reported information on one or more outcomes specified in this review.  We included 11 studies, randomising 5217 participants, in one or more meta‐analyses (range 2 to 9 studies per individual meta‐analysis), with 10 of these studies providing IPD; the remaining 6 studies were included in the narrative results only.   Most studies were conducted at children's hospitals. Twenty‐five studies, including all those contributing data to meta‐analyses, randomised newborns up to age three weeks to receive a skin care intervention or standard infant skin care. Eight of the 11 studies contributing to meta‐analyses recruited infants at high risk of developing eczema or food allergy, although the definition of high risk varied between studies. Durations of intervention and follow‐up ranged from 24 hours to three years. All interventions were compared against no skin care intervention or local standard care. Of the 17 studies that reported information on our prespecified outcomes, 13 assessed emollients. We assessed most of the evidence in the review as low certainty and had some concerns about risk of bias. A rating of some concerns was most often due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors or significant missing data, which could have impacted outcome measurement but was judged unlikely to have done so. We assessed the evidence for the primary food allergy outcome as high risk of bias due to the inclusion of only one trial, where findings varied based on different assumptions about missing data. Skin care interventions during infancy probably do not change the risk of eczema by one to three years of age (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.31; risk difference 5 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI 28 less to 47 more; moderate‐certainty evidence; 3075 participants, 7 trials) or time to onset of eczema (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.14; moderate‐certainty evidence; 3349 participants, 9 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may increase the risk of IgE‐mediated food allergy by one to three years of age (RR 2.53, 95% CI 0.99 to 6.49; low‐certainty evidence; 976 participants, 1 trial) but may not change risk of allergic sensitisation to a food allergen by age one to three years (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.71; low‐certainty evidence; 1794 participants, 3 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may slightly increase risk of parent report of immediate reaction to a common food allergen at two years (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61; low‐certainty evidence; 1171 participants, 1 trial); however, this was only seen for cow’s milk, and may be unreliable due to over‐reporting of milk allergy in infants. Skin care interventions during infancy probably increase risk of skin infection over the intervention period (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.75; risk difference 17 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI one more to 38 more; moderate‐certainty evidence; 2728 participants, 6 trials) and may increase the risk of infant slippage over the intervention period (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.99; low‐certainty evidence; 2538 participants, 4 trials) and stinging/allergic reactions to moisturisers (RR 2.24, 95% 0.67 to 7.43; low‐certainty evidence; 343 participants, 4 trials), although CIs for slippages and stinging/allergic reactions were wide and include the possibility of no effect or reduced risk. Preplanned subgroup analyses showed that the effects of interventions were not influenced by age, duration of intervention, hereditary risk, filaggrin ( FLG ) mutation, chromosome 11 intergenic variant rs2212434,   or classification of intervention type for risk of developing eczema. We could not evaluate these effects on risk of food allergy. Evidence was insufficient to show whether adherence to interventions influenced the relationship between skin care interventions and eczema or food allergy development. Authors' conclusions Based on low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence, skin care interventions such as emollients during the first year of life in healthy infants are probably not effective for preventing eczema; may increase risk of food allergy; and probably increase risk of skin infection. Further study is needed to understand whether different approaches to infant skin care might prevent eczema or food allergy. Plain language summary Skin care interventions for preventing eczema and food allergy Does moisturising baby skin prevent eczema or food allergies? Key messages Skin care treatments in babies, such as using moisturisers on the skin during the first year of life, probably do not prevent babies from developing eczema; may increase the chance of food allergy; and probably increase the chance of skin infection. This review looked at the prevention of eczema and food allergy only. Skin care treatments are still important to treat eczema.  What are allergies? An immune response is how the body recognises and defends itself against substances that appear harmful. An allergy is a reaction of the body's immune system to a particular food or substance (an allergen) that is usually harmless. Different allergies affect different parts of the body, and their effects can be mild or serious. Food allergies and eczema Eczema is a common skin condition  that causes dry, itchy, cracked skin. Eczema is common in children, often developing before their first birthday, and may be long‐lasting. Allergies to food can cause itching in the mouth, a raised itchy red rash, swelling of the face, stomach symptoms, or difficulty breathing. They usually happen within two hours after a food is eaten. People with food allergies often have other allergic conditions, such as asthma, hay fever, and eczema. Why we did this Cochrane Review We wanted to learn how skin care affects the risk of a baby developing eczema or food allergies. Skin care treatments included: • putting moisturisers on a baby's skin; • bathing babies with water containing moisturisers or moisturising oils; • advising parents to use less soap, or to bathe their child less often; • using water softeners.  We also wanted to know if these skin care treatments cause any unwanted effects.  What did we do? We searched for studies of different types of skin care for healthy babies (aged up to one year) with no previous food allergy, eczema, or other skin condition. Search date:  we incorporated evidence published up to July 2021. We were interested in studies that reported: • how many children developed eczema, or food allergy, by age one to three years; • how severe the eczema was (according to a researcher and to parents); • how long it took for eczema to develop; • parents' reports of immediate (under two hours) reactions to a food allergen; • how many children developed sensitivity to a particular food allergen; • any unwanted effects. We assessed the strengths and weaknesses of each study to determine how reliable the results might be, and then combined the results of the relevant studies and looked at overall effects.   What we found We found 33 studies, involving 25,827 babies, that assessed any type of skin intervention. The included studies took place in Europe, Australia, Japan, and the USA, most often at children's hospitals. Skin care was compared against no skin care or usual skin care for babies in that country. Treatment and follow‐up times ranged from 24 hours to three years. Many studies (13) tested the use of moisturisers; the other studies mainly tested the use of bathing and cleansing products and how often they were used. Of the 33 included studies, only 11 studies had comparable outcomes of eczema, food allergy, or adverse effects and were combined for analysis. All of these studies enrolled babies before they were one month old, and  eight of these studies included babies thought to be at high risk for developing eczema.  What are the main results of our review? Compared to no skin care or standard care, moisturisers: • probably do not change the chance of developing eczema by age one to three years (7 studies; 3075 babies), or the time needed for eczema to develop (9 studies; 3349 babies); • may increase the chance of developing a food allergy as judged by a researcher (1 study; 976 babies) by age one to three years; • may slightly increase the number of immediate reactions to a common food allergen at two years, as reported by parents (1 study; 1171 babies); • probably cause more skin infections (6 studies; 2728 babies); • may increase unwanted effects, such as a stinging feeling or an allergic reaction to moisturisers (4 studies; 343 babies); • may increase the chance of babies slipping (4 studies; 2538 babies); • may not affect the chance of developing sensitivity to food allergens (3 studies; 1797 babies) by age one to three years. Confidence in our results We are moderately confident in our results for developing eczema and the time needed to develop eczema. We are less confident about our results for food allergy or sensitivity, which are based on small numbers of studies with widely varying results. These results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. Our confidence in the review findings for skin infections is moderate, but low for stinging or allergic reactions and slipping. ",10.1002/14651858.cd013534.pub3,Cochrane

DESIGN/METHOD: We performed a  retrospective observational study of all patients presenting to a university  hospital between January 2015 and April 2020 with iFoBI with a focus on objects  swallowed, timing of endoscopy and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: 239 episodes of  iFoBI in 51 individuals were recorded with a significant increase in incidence  throughout the study period (Welch (5, 17.3)=15.1, p<0.001), imposing a high  burden on staff and resources.

However, most dental treatment occurs outside of a hospital  setting; thus the time to respond to a life-threatening situation is crucial. The  aim of this study was to determine the frequency and characteristics of medical  emergencies that occurred at the Griffith University Dental Clinic over a 6-year  period. METHODS: Data involving medical emergencies was collected at a dental  school between January 2014 and December 2019.

A larger portion of these incidents  occurred during dental treatment (62.0%) as opposed to before (12.0%) or after  (26.0%). Most medical emergencies happened within the dental student clinic  (72.2%) followed by the dental waiting room (19.5%) and dental private clinic  (8.3%). CONCLUSION: Overall, the number of medical emergencies at the Griffith  University Dental Clinic was low. The most common medical emergencies were  syncope, hypoglycemia, and foreign body ingestion. Dental education in  preventative strategies and training in basic life support is necessary to ensure  dental practitioners can manage the acute deterioration of a patient promptly.",10.1002/jdd.12859,PubMed

Among cats with gastrointestinal illnesses, we found that 9.97% had FB obstructions. The most common presenting breeds of both cat patients with FB obstruction and controls were Persian and Siamese. Similarly, most of the presented normal and diseased cats were males. Cats with FB were younger (p<0.05) than those of control cats. There was no significant difference in the body weight for cats with FB versus control cats. Among the investigated factors, we also observed that living style, anxiety/stress, and frequency of exercise were the only factors that were strongly associated with the occurrence of FB obstruction. In conclusion, observations of this study indicate that a living style, anxiety/stress, and frequency of exercise have a significant impact on cat behavior and should be seen by cat-owned clients as important to prevent pica.

For this purpose, 2 original screwdrivers (Straumann and BEGO) and a universal screwdriver kit (bredent) were investigated. On 1 implant per screwdriver, 26 abutments were properly attached one after the other with the corresponding abutment screws. After tightening the abutment screw, the force required to pull the screwdriver off the screw head was determined with a spring balance. For both manufacturers, greater pull-off forces were measured when using the original screwdrivers than when using the universal screwdriver. The pull-off force (mean +/- SD) required for the Straumann original screwdriver was 3.7 +/- 1.4 N, while that required for the universal screwdriver was 0.1 +/- 0.1 N (P < .001). The pull-off force was 1.5 +/- 1.5 N for the BEGO original screwdriver and 0.7 +/- 0.9 N for the universal screwdriver (P = .19). Using original manufacturer-supplied screwdrivers could thus minimize the risk of the screwdriver slipping out of the screw head during dental treatment and being swallowed or aspirated by the patient.",10.1563/aaid-joi-d-20-00249,Web of Science

Therefore,  studies may not draw generalizable conclusions. Furthermore, data regarding FBIs  management in Europe are limited and outdated. This study aimed to analyze the  endoscopic management and outcomes of FBIs in an Italian tertiary care hospital  to identify risk factors for endoscopic failure. METHODS: We retrospectively  reviewed patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for FBIs between  2007 and 2017. Baseline, clinical, FBIs, and endoscopic characteristics and  outcomes were collected and reported using descriptive statistics and logistic  regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 381 endoscopies for FBIs, 288 (75.5%) were  emergent endoscopy and 135 (35,4%) included underlying upper gastrointestinal  conditions. The study population included 44 pediatric patients (11.5%), 54  prisoners (15.8%), and 283 adults (74.2%). The most common type and location of  FBIs were food boluses (52.9%) and upper esophagus (36.5%), respectively. While  eight patients (2.1%) developed major adverse events requiring hospital  admission, the remainder (97.9%) were discharged after observation. No mortality  occurred. Endoscopic success was achieved in 263 of 286 (91.9%) verified FBIs  endoscopies. Endoscopic failure (8.04%) was associated with age, bone, disk  battery, intentional ingestion, razor blade, prisoners, and stomach in the  univariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that intentional  ingestion was associated with endoscopic failure (odds ratio: 7.31; 95%  confidence interval = 2.06-25.99; P  = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Endoscopy for FBIs is  safe and successful, with low hospital admission rate in children, prisoners, and  adults.

Adolescents and young adults may carry out this act to hurt themselves or even suicide. Often, most reports related to deliberate swallowing are typically either surgical or gastrointestinal and rarely are found in psychiatric articles; more often, the swallowed foreign objects (80 - 90%) are disposed of spontaneously, and 10 - 20% of them require endoscopy for more study and less than 1% of them need surgery to be removed or its complications. Case Presentation: The presented patient is a 17-year-old girl admitted to the psychosomatic ward of Afzalipour Hospital due to intentional poisoning. During the year before her admission, on three separate occasions, she detached the knife blade from its haft and swallowed it. She underwent laparotomy twice, one time for sigmoid tearing and damage to the left Ovary, to remove the knife and regeneration of the left ovary and sigmoid, and another time to remove the knife in order not to cause damage to her intestines. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in the world in which an ovary has been damaged. Further investigation into her background shows some extent of privation due to her family’s long-term economic problems and instability; moreover, sexual and physical abuse was also confirmed. The patient was prescribed clozapine, which decreased her suicidal behavior and attempts noticeably. Conclusions: Swallowing foreign bodies in this patient is interpreted as both self-punishment and punishing others (those who thought they were hurt or may be blamed for their despair or rejection). Intentional swallowing of foreign objects behavior is more resistant than other self-harming activities and may have a worse prognosis. Swallowing foreign objects requires a sophisticated process that, if not correctly managed, may result in serious complications; therefore, appropriate psychiatric counseling and supportive treatment are necessary for these patients. Specific to this patient eliminating the effects of suicide and reaching medical stability with a short admission was necessary. Her suicidal behavior and attempts decreased significantly after starting clozapine treatment. Therefore, clozapine treatment is recommended for patients with suicidal behavior and self-harm. © 2023, Brieflands. All rights reserved.",10.5812/ijhrba-134720,SCOPUS

As a clinicopathologic disorder, a diagnosis of EoE requires a constellation of clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and histologic findings (at least 15 eosinophils/high‐powered microscope field (eos/hpf)). Current guidelines no longer require the failure of response to proton pump inhibitor medications to establish a diagnosis of EoE, but continue to suggest the exclusion of other etiologies of esophageal eosinophilia. The treatment goals for EoE are improvement in clinical symptoms, resolution of esophageal eosinophilia and other histologic abnormalities, endoscopic improvement, improved quality of life, improved esophageal function, minimized adverse effects of treatment, and prevention of disease progression and subsequent complications. Currently, there is no cure for EoE, making long‐term treatment necessary. Standard treatment modalities include dietary modifications, esophageal dilation, and pharmacologic therapy. Effective pharmacologic therapies include corticosteroids, rapidly emerging biological therapies, and proton pump inhibitor medications. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of medical interventions for people with eosinophilic esophagitis. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP to 3 March 2023. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any medical intervention or food elimination diet for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis, either alone or in combination, to any other intervention (including placebo). Data collection and analysis Pairs of review authors independently selected studies and conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We expressed outcomes as a risk ratio (RR) and as the mean or standardized mean difference (MD/SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Our primary outcomes were: clinical, histological, and endoscopic improvement, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Secondary outcomes were: serious and total adverse events, and quality of life. Main results We included 41 RCTs with 3253 participants. Eleven studies included pediatric patients while the rest recruited both children and adults. Four studies were in patients with inactive disease while the rest were in patients with active disease. We identified 19 intervention comparisons. In this abstract we present the results of the primary outcomes for the two main comparisons: corticosteroids versus placebo and biologics versus placebo, based on the prespecified outcomes defined of the primary studies. Fourteen studies compared corticosteroids to placebo for induction of remission and the risk of bias for these studies was mostly low. Corticosteroids may lead to slightly better clinical improvement (20% higher), measured dichotomously (risk ratio (RR) 1.74, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.80; 6 studies, 583 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 4; low certainty), and may lead to slightly better clinical improvement, measured continuously (standard mean difference (SMD) 0.51, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.85; 5 studies, 475 participants; low certainty). Corticosteroids lead to a large histological improvement (63% higher), measured dichotomously (RR 11.94, 95% CI 6.56 to 21.75; 12 studies, 978 participants; NNTB = 3; high certainty), and may lead to histological improvement, measured continuously (SMD 1.42, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.82; 5 studies, 449 participants; low certainty). Corticosteroids may lead to little to no endoscopic improvement, measured dichotomously (RR 2.60, 95% CI 0.82 to 8.19; 5 studies, 596 participants; low certainty), and may lead to endoscopic improvement, measured continuously (SMD 1.33, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.08; 5 studies, 596 participants; low certainty). Corticosteroids may lead to slightly fewer withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.96; 14 studies, 1032 participants; low certainty). Nine studies compared biologics to placebo for induction of remission. Biologics may result in little to no difference in clinical improvement, measured dichotomously (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.52; 5 studies, 410 participants; low certainty), and may result in better clinical improvement, measured continuously (SMD 0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.78; 7 studies, 387 participants; moderate certainty). Biologics result in better histological improvement (55% higher), measured dichotomously (RR 6.73, 95% CI 2.58 to 17.52; 8 studies, 925 participants; NNTB = 2; moderate certainty). We could not draw conclusions for this outcome when measured continuously (SMD 1.01, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.66; 6 studies, 370 participants; very low certainty). Biologics may result in little to no difference in endoscopic improvement, measured dichotomously (effect not estimable, low certainty). We cannot draw conclusions for this outcome when measured continuously (SMD 2.79, 95% CI 0.36 to 5.22; 1 study, 11 participants; very low certainty). There may be no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.74; 8 studies, 792 participants; low certainty). Authors' conclusions Corticosteroids (as compared to placebo) may lead to clinical symptom improvement when reported both as dichotomous and continuous outcomes, from the primary study definitions. Corticosteroids lead to a large increase in histological improvement (dichotomous outcome) and may increase histological improvement (continuous outcome) when compared to placebo. Corticosteroids may or may not increase endoscopic improvement (depending on whether the outcome is measured dichotomously or continuously). Withdrawals due to adverse events (dichotomous outcome) may occur less frequently when corticosteroids are compared to placebo. Biologics (as compared to placebo) may not lead to clinical symptom improvement when reported as a dichotomous outcome and may lead to an increase in clinical symptom improvement (as a continuous outcome), from the primary study definitions. Biologics lead to a large increase in histological improvement when reported as a dichotomous outcome, but this is uncertain when reported as a continuous outcome, as compared to placebo. Biologics may not increase endoscopic improvement (dichotomous outcome), but this is uncertain when measured as a continuous outcome. Withdrawals due to adverse events as a dichotomous outcome may occur as frequently when biologics are compared to placebo. Plain language summary Medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis Key messages We found that while corticosteroids may improve patients' symptoms, they certainly reduce the amount of allergic cells (eosinophils) and they may improve what the disease looks like under visual inspection (endoscopy), when compared to placebo, for children and adults with eosinophilic esophagitis. They may be just as safe as a placebo (dummy treatment). We found that biologics (a type of treatment that uses substances made from living organisms to treat disease) may improve patients' symptoms, that they certainly reduce the amount of allergic cells, and that they may be no different in terms of what the disease looks like under visual inspection, when compared to placebo, for children and adults with eosinophilic esophagitis. They may be just as safe as a placebo. What is eosinophilic esophagitis? Eosinophilic esophagitis is a long‐term allergic condition in which the esophagus becomes inflamed (sore), which can lead to difficulty swallowing, vomiting, heartburn, and chest and stomach pain. Particles in foods or the air cause the immune system to have an allergic reaction and produce immune cells, which are called eosinophils. These build up in the esophagus, the tube that connects the mouth with the stomach. Eosinophilic esophagitis was first identified in the 1990s and since then it has been recognized as a major digestive illness. It is not known what causes it, but it might be related to genetics combined with environmental triggers. People with eosinophilic esophagitis tend to have other allergies as well. Currently, there is no cure for eosinophilic esophagitis, making long‐term treatment necessary. Standard treatments include diets, stretching of the esophagus (dilation), and drugs such as corticosteroids, biological medications, and proton pump inhibitor medications. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if the available medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis work for improving patients' symptoms, reducing the amount of allergic cells when measured under a microscope, and improving what the disease looks like under visual examination. We also wanted to find out how safe they are and if they improve quality of life. What did we do? We searched for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing any medical treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis with any other medical treatment, in both adults and children.   What did we find? We found 41 studies with 3253 participants. Eleven studies were in children only while the rest were in a mix of children and adults. We identified 19 comparisons. In this summary, we present the results of the two main comparisons: corticosteroids compared to placebo and biologics compared to placebo. We found that corticosteroids may be better than placebo at improving patients' symptoms. We are highly certain that corticosteroids are better than placebo at reducing the amount of eosinophils (allergic cells) when measured under a microscope. Corticosteroids may be better than placebo at improving what the disease looks like under visual examination (endoscopy). We also found that people taking corticosteroids may be less likely to leave a study due to unwanted or harmful effects (side effects), and that they probably experience a similar number of both serious side effects and side effects in total, compared to placebo. There may be no difference between corticosteroids and placebo in the improvement of quality of life. We found that biologics may be better than placebo at improving patients' symptoms. It is likely that biologics are better than placebo at reducing the amount of allergic cells when measured under a microscope. Biologics may be no different to placebo at improving what the disease looks like under visual examination. We also found that people on biologics may be equally likely to leave a study due to side effects, or have serious side effects, and may experience similar numbers of total side effects, compared to placebo. There may be no difference between biologics and placebo in the improvement of quality of life. What are the limitations of the evidence? The evidence in children only was quite limited and we do not know if the conclusions above can definitely apply to children specifically. Another limitation of the evidence is that the outcomes were measured in many different ways, which may have weakened our conclusions. Other treatments used by the participants were also something that varied a lot between people, and may have affected our conclusions. Finally, we were limited in the conclusions we could make about the effects of sex, age, extent of disease, dosage, and type of corticosteroid or biologic. How up‐to‐date is this review?

Packets usually contain of opium, cocaine, cannabis  and amphetamines. The significant complications of body packing usually are  symptoms of drug toxicity due to leaking or ruptured packets or symptoms of  ingesting relatively large foreign bodies. Herein, we present a case of heroin  body-packing that resulted in subsequent bowel obstruction. CASE PRESENTATION: A  30-year-old male, who was brought from the prison to the emergency department,  complained of abdominal pain. After the absence of intoxication symptoms and  insignificant plain abdominal radiograph results, abdominal computed tomography  (CT) scan revealed the presence of ingested packets in the stomach as well as in  the patient's small intestine. Therefore, the decision of surgery was immediately  made for the patient, and during the surgery, the drug packets were entirely  removed. The patient was discharged in good general condition three days after  his surgery. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Body packers are in considerable risk as  rupture of packet inside the body and risk of obstruction that both of them may  be fatal. Patients should be monitored for complications, possible early  treatment, and removal or assistance in expulsion drug packets from the body.  Initially on plain abdominal radiographs, classic findings suggest the presence  of drug packets. CONCLUSION: In case of an inconclusive plain abdominal  radiograph, further investigation with CT is indicated, with an almost 100 %  sensitivity. For symptomatic patients, bowel obstruction and acute drug toxicity  are the two most common indications for surgical intervention.",10.1016/j.ijscr.2023.108503,PubMed

The purpose of this study is to describe the outcomes of patients with NER of EFI. A retrospective chart review from 2007 to 2017 was performed at a single tertiary care center. There were 593 patients who presented to the emergency department with EFI, defined as recent soft food ingestion and inability to tolerate oral secretions. Adequate follow-up was defined as a gastroenterology clinic visit or EGD within 6 months of EFI. Out of these, 149 patients (25.1%) had NER of their EFI. Patients with NER were less likely to have adequate follow-up than those with ER (45.0% vs. 59.5%, P = 0.003). Of those without established esophageal disease and NER, 92.5% had significant esophageal pathology on endoscopy, including stricture (34.0%), features of eosinophilic esophagitis (30.2%), and esophagitis (22.6%). Recurrent EFI occurred at a similar rate between patients with NER and ER (9.4% vs. 14.6%, P = 0.14). Patients with established esophageal disease (odds ratio [OR]: 1.51, P = 0.04) and recommendation to follow-up at time of EFI (OR: 6.06, P < 0.001) were most likely to follow up after EFI. Approximately, a quarter of patients with EFI will experience NER of their EFI. Virtually, all patients (92.5%) were found to have esophageal disease warranting longitudinal care. Importantly, follow-up rates are significantly lower in those with NER than their counterparts requiring EGD.

Yet there remains a dearth of literature on the utility and outcomes of  paediatric GI endoscopy in the Asia-Pacific region. Data on the diagnostic value  of paediatric GI endoscopy would be an important aspect of discussion, with the  emergence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and eosinophilic GI disease as  increasingly common endoscopic diagnoses. Time-based trends in paediatric GI  endoscopy do point towards more IBD and gastroesophageal reflux disease-related  complications being diagnosed, with a declining incidence of GI bleeding.  However, the real-world diagnostic value of endoscopy in Asia must be  contextualised to the region-specific prevalence of paediatric GI diseases.  Helicobacter pylori infection, particularly that of multidrug-resistant strains,  remains a highly prevalent problem in specific regions. Paediatric functional GI  disorders still account for the majority of childhood GI complaints in most  centres, hence the diagnostic yield of endoscopy should be critically evaluated  in the absence of alarm symptoms. GI therapeutic endoscopy is also occasionally  required for children with ingested foreign bodies, intestinal polyposis or  oesophageal strictures requiring dilation. Endoscopic haemostasis is a  potentially life-saving skill in cases of massive GI bleeding typically from  varices or peptic ulcers. Advanced endoscopic techniques such as capsule  endoscopy and balloon-assisted enteroscopy have found traction, particularly in  East Asian centres, as invaluable diagnostic and therapeutic tools in the  management of IBD, obscure GI bleeding and intestinal polyposis. State of the art  endoscopic diagnostics and therapeutics, including the use of artificial  intelligence-aided endoscopy algorithms, real-time confocal laser endomicroscopy  and peroral endoscopic myotomy, are expected to gain more utility in paediatrics.  As paediatric gastroenterology matures as a subspecialty in Asia, it is essential  current paediatric endoscopists and future trainees adhere to minimum practice  standards, and keep abreast of the evolving trends in the diagnostic and  therapeutic value of endoscopy. This review discusses the available published  literature on the utility of paediatric GI endoscopy in Asia Pacific, with the  relevant clinical outcomes.",10.3748/wjg.v29.i18.2717,PubMed

Often, patients with psychiatric conditions repeatedly ingest foreign bodies, leading to frequent emergency department visits. Standardised management guidelines are lacking, resulting in high hospitalisation rates, interventions, and complications. This study focuses on recent DFBI cases at our institution, providing insights into this complex condition and holistic management. Methods: Patients admitted by the surgical team at Croydon University Hospital between 2017 and 2023 with DFBI were included. Data on demographics, clinical presentation, investigations, and management were collected. Complications, hospitalisations, interventions, and cost analysis were recorded. Results: Eight patients presented a total of 52 times. The incidence of DFBI increased over time. Swallowed objects included knives, needles, magnets, glass, batteries, pencils, gloves, lighters, and screws. Each patient underwent an average of 21 X-rays, 2 CT scans, and 3 OGDs. Eleven laparotomies and 1 laparoscopy were performed. The average length of stay was 44.5 days. Complications included pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, enterotomy, hernia, and infection. The average cost per patient was £30,866.25. Conclusions: DFBI poses a significant burden on healthcare systems. Patients face radiation exposure and repeated invasive interventions, necessitating a comprehensive approach. Understanding DFBI from a biopsychosocial and ethical perspective is crucial. A multidisciplinary team should be involved early, with clear goals. Further research is needed for optimal management pathways.",10.1093/bjs/znad348.067,Embase

During the single hospitalization described in this report, she had  multiple incidents of self-harm, aggression, and 9 FBIs. A multidisciplinary team  involving psychiatry, emergency medicine, gastroenterology, surgery, internal  medicine, nursing, social work, behavioral health technicians, case management,  chaplain, the legal department, police officers, and hospital maintenance was  necessary for care coordination. Interventions included 8 endoscopies and an  abdominal surgery to retrieve swallowed foreign bodies, pain management,  psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions for agitation, and  environmental precautions to minimize the risk of ingestion. Ultimately, to  prevent further trauma and limit additional opportunities for FBI, a  collaborative decision was made with the patient to discharge her to her home  with outpatient psychologist and psychiatrist support.

We implemented a Foreign Body Algorithm  (FBA) designed to delay all but the most urgent endoscopy for EFI and FBI until  regular working hours. METHODS: Using endoscopy records from multiple academic  and community hospitals within a large integrated health system in the United  states, we identified esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) performed for food  impactions and foreign body ingestions occurring between May 2011 and February  2021. RESULTS: We identified 479 EGDs performed for FBI and EFI. The introduction  of the FBA was associated with a shorter length of stay (LOS) for overall cases  (0.35 vs. 0.8 d P <0.001), day cases (0.16 vs. 1.0 d P <0.001), and night cases  (0.40 vs. 0.6 d P =0.03). The introduction of the FBA did not change the rate of  overall adverse events (AE) or night AE. AE from the entire cohort was rare (3%;  16 total). Of the AE, most were sedation related. The introduction of the FBA did  not affect the overall rate of night cases or AE, but the rate of after-hours  endoscopy for intentional ingestions decreased from 17.2% to 3.1% ( P =0.01).  CONCLUSION: This is one of the largest studies of esophageal impactions and  foreign bodies in adults in the United States, and the first to examine the  effects of a protocol designed to avoid after-hours endoscopy. These results  suggest that postponing after-hours EGD until the daytime is not associated with  adverse safety outcomes or increased LOS.",10.1097/mcg.0000000000001789,PubMed

Magnets pose a unique set of risks when ingested due to their attractive forces  and subsequent risk of adherence, pressure necrosis, and perforation  complications. Radiographs only provide a limited snapshot in the setting of  multiple magnet ingestion when the risk of complication is highest. We  hypothesize that abdominal ultrasound (US) has the potential to supplement  radiographs in assessing ingested magnets by determining the presence of bowel  loop entrapment and of any extraluminal fluid. METHODS: We recreated various  scenarios of magnet configurations using animal cadaveric bowel models. X-ray and  US images were obtained in various bowel-magnet orientations. RESULTS: We  identified several key US features to suggest bowel wall tethering. These include  direct visualization of bowel wall entrapment between magnets (what we term the  ""dangerous V sign""), anti-dependent positions of the magnets, and inability to  separate loops of bowel with compression. CONCLUSION: These findings could  potentially provide valuable information when directing the urgency of  intervention in foreign body ingestion. Ultrasound may supplement and improve the  current guidelines in management of magnet ingestion.",10.1007/s10140-023-02160-7,PubMed

This review will focus on  the clinical presentation and complications of these two common inadvertent  ingestions in children, as well as recent regulatory efforts and advocacy  opportunities. RECENT FINDINGS: The rising incidence of cannabis toxicity in  children has corresponded with its legalization across several countries in the  last decade. Inadvertent pediatric cannabis intoxication is most commonly due to  the ingestion of edible forms discovered by children in their own home. The  clinical presentation can be nonspecific, therefore clinicians should have a low  threshold for including it on their differential diagnosis. Button battery  ingestions are also increasing in incidence. While many children are asymptomatic  at presentation, button battery ingestions can quickly cause esophageal injury  and lead to several serious and potentially life-threatening complications.  Prompt recognition and removal of esophageal button batteries is essential for  reducing harm. SUMMARY: Cannabis and button battery ingestions are important for  physicians who take care of children to recognize and manage appropriately. Given  their rising incidence, there are many opportunities for policy improvements and  advocacy efforts to make a difference in preventing these ingestions altogether.",10.1097/mop.0000000000001238,PubMed

The aim of this study is to describe the profile of inmates who have ingested foreign bodies, to determine the nature of these foreign bodies and to specify their management. Materials and Methods: Our retrospective and descriptive study focused' on 13 inmates having ingested' 47 foreign bodies and who consulted the emergency of our department over a 5-year period from January 2018 to July 2023. Results: The study population consisted of 12 men and one woman with an average age of 32 years (24 years-47 years). Foreign bodies ingested by inmates were dominated by batteries (59.52%) followed by lighters (19.04%). The majoritý of foreign bodies were, at the time of discovery, located mainly in the stomach (6 cases) and colon (4 cases). Ingestion resulted in epigastric pain (3 cases), externalized gastrointestinal bleeding with epigastralgia (2 cases), and no symptoms (8 cases). Of the 13 cases of foreign body ingestion, 6 patients underwent endoscopic extraction in the gastroenterology department. Extraction was by diathermic loop, dormia loop and endoscopic basket. Successful extraction was achieved in 4 cases (66.66%), and unsuccessful extraction in 2 cases (33.33%). Only one inmate required surgical extraction, and in 6 patients the elimination of foreign bodies in the stool was spontaneous under medical supervision. Conclusion: Foreign body ingestion is frequent and voluntary in the prison environment. It is characterized by the multiplicity of foreign bodies. The rate of successful extraction of ingested foreign bodies in our practice is satisfactory, requiring an experienced endoscopist to perform the extraction without complications and avoid recourse to surgery.

Perforation is defined as a full -thickness tear in the esophageal wall due to a trauma on the esophageal lumen or to a sudden increase of endoluminal pressure, like in spontaneous perforations. The most frequent causes are: iatrogenic injuries, spontaneous perforations, foreign body or caustic ingestion, trauma, tumors etc. The onset of symptoms varies depending on the location of perforation (cervical, intrathoracic or intraabdominal), the degree of tissue destruction and extension of contamination of surrounding organs, the cause, the timing of diagnosis and the presence of underlying esophageal disorders. Post -operative esophageal leaks have a different origin but a quite similar clinical presentation and treatment to esophageal perforations. The higher reported incidence is after cervical esophagogastric anastomosis, followed by intrathoracic anastomosis (above all after trans-hiatal one). It is already proven that short diagnostic timing and correct treatment can reduce mortality of 50%.

Clinical guidelines recommend performing plain x-rays as the primary  modality of diagnosis. Although point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) has increasingly  been integrated into the daily practice of emergency medicine, it has been poorly  investigated in the diagnostic approach for FBI.This review aims to highlight the  current state of PoCUS use for pediatric FBI.The following research question was  considered in this narrative review: Is PoCUS useful for FBI management? METHODS:  A literature search was conducted to identify articles reporting PoCUS use for  the management of FBI. All articles were assessed for quality by 2 reviewers.  MAIN RESULTS: The 14 selected articles reported 52 FBI cases in which PoCUS  successfully identified and located the ingested FB. Point-of-care ultrasound was  used either as the primary imaging technique or after positive or negative x-ray  findings. In 5 cases (9.6%), PoCUS was the only modality used for the diagnosis.  Of these cases, 3 (60%) underwent a successful procedure to remove the FB and 2  (40%) received conservative treatment without complications. CONCLUSIONS: This  review suggests that PoCUS might be a reliable modality for the initial  management of FBI. PoCUS can locate, identify, and evaluate the size of the FB in  a wide range of materials and gastrointestinal locations. Point-of-care  ultrasound could eventually become the go-to modality in the case of radiolucent  FB, thus avoiding the use of radiation.

When unwitnessed, it poses therapeutic and diagnostic challenges especially in the  presence of pre-existing anatomical pathology. We aim to analyze the clinical  course, management, and outcome of children with impacted esophageal FBs.  METHODS: Retrospective chart review (Jan 2000-Feb 2018) recruiting children with  impacted esophageal FBs. FBs in cricopharynx and those that moved to stomach were  excluded. Investigations/management were based on underlying anatomical  pathology, duration of impaction, and difficult FBs. Clinical details,  management, and outcomes were collated. RESULTS: Of 86 children, N1 = 31 had  identifiable predisposing anatomic pathology and N2 = 55 had impactions in normal  esophagus or difficult FBs. N1 group presented early (42 months), had recurrent  impactions (1-6), and needed multiple dilatations (0-8) and longer follow-up (avg  35 months). Food matter was commonest impaction. Many had persistent symptoms. N2  group had commonly coin impactions and strictures developed in long standing or  corrosive FBs. Most were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Abnormal esophageal anatomy  predisposes to impaction with organic food bolus. Age of presentation is earlier  with recurrent impactions requiring multiple dilatations/surgery and longer  follow-up. Metallic FBs commonly impact in normal esophagus and are often  innocuous.

In this case study, we report a case of lanthanum ingestion resulting in imaging consistent with ingested  metallic foreign bodies. SUMMARY: Hyperphosphatemia affects most patients with  end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with morbidity and mortality.  Lanthanum carbonate reduces daily phosphate absorption and is indicated as a  non-calcium-based phosphate binder in patients with ESRD. A 58-year-old man with  a medical history of stage 5 chronic kidney disease was admitted to the intensive  care unit (ICU) for hyperkalemia and acute respiratory failure after a missed  dialysis session. He required vasopressors, intubation, and continuous renal  replacement therapy. Admission imaging demonstrated several ingested metallic  foreign bodies within the colon. There was consideration of colorectal surgery  and gastroenterology consultation. On the initial medication reconciliation, no  medications that would have the radiographic appearance of ingested metallic  foreign bodies were identified. On further review of prescription data available  through the electronic medical record, it was noted that the patient had recently  filled a prescription for lanthanum despite its apparent discontinuation on a  previous admission. After interviewing the patient's wife, it was confirmed that  the patient had continued taking lanthanum and that he was swallowing it whole  and not chewing it. No consultations or interventions were performed, and the  metallic foreign bodies were no longer present on further imaging after a period  of 35 days. CONCLUSION: Escalation of care was avoided in this patient due to the  performance of diligent medication reconciliation and recognition of the impact  of lanthanum ingestion on imaging.",10.1093/ajhp/zxac380,PubMed

Choking (often also called  suffocation) can be caused by food or inedible objects and leads to various  degrees of asphyxiation or lack of oxygen in the blood stream. The incidence is  very high in both young children and adults, especially seniors. However, since  not all choking episodes end up in the emergency room or become fatalities, they  often escape statistics. Although episodes of choking from non-edible bodies are  infrequent, they affect mostly young children. Three of the most common risks for  choking in general are neurological disorders, dysphagia and dental issues (few  or no teeth, unstable or unsuitable prosthesis or orthodontic appliances).  The  purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk factors of choking and ways to  reduce/avoid this event. We reported data on a series of 138 patients admitted to  the emergency department following a choking event, at a hospital in Rome, Italy.  The age group of the analyzed population ranged from 1 to 88 years, with the most  represented age group of these between 40 and 59, with a similar distribution  between males and females. The types of foods on which people choked reflected  the seasonal, traditional and local foods: 67% of patients reported choking on  fish bones followed by meat bones (9%)  and artichokes (3%). Three relevant  non-food choking elements reported were: orthodontic items, toothpicks and pins  (one occurrence each). We also reported on two clinical cases of patients choking  on meat and a chicken bone. In conclusion, choking awareness and prevention are  essential for implementing potential life-saving precautions. Prevention is the  first tool to reduce the occurrence of this event, therefore it is necessary to  analyze the risk factors and educate the population to eliminate them. Proper  chewing and oral manipulation are paramount functions in preventing choking,  along with meal-time supervision if little children and elderly.

METHODS: The medical record was queried for all patients under 21 years  old evaluated at our institution for button battery ingestion from 2008 to 2021.  A severe outcome was defined as having at least one of the following:  deep/circumferential mucosal erosion, perforation, mediastinitis, vascular or  airway injury/fistula, or development of esophageal stricture. From a selection  of clinically relevant factors, logistic regression determined predictors of a  severe outcome, which were incorporated into a risk model. RESULTS: 143 patients  evaluated for button battery ingestion were analyzed. 24 (17%) had a severe  outcome. The independent predictors of a severe outcome in multivariate analysis  were location of battery in the esophagus on imaging (96%), battery size  >/ = 2 cm (95%), and presence of any symptoms on presentation (96%), with  P < 0.001 in all cases.

In adults, foreign body ingestion is more common in  patients with underlying psychiatric comorbidity, the elderly, alcohol  intoxication, and in prisoners. This study reviewed the management of patients  presenting to a tertiary hospital with foreign body ingestion. Patients and  methods A retrospective review of patients presenting with foreign body ingestion  to a tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Victoria, was undertaken from January 2017  to December 2021. Data collected included patient demographics, type of foreign  body, length of stay, imaging modalities, management strategies, and  complications. High-risk ingestion was defined as sharp objects, length >5 cm,  diameter >2.5 cm, button battery and/or magnet ingestion or esophageal as per  international guidelines. Results A total of 157 presentations by 63 patients  with foreign body ingestion occurred between 2017 and 2021 (50% male; median age  30 years). Of the patients, 56% had underlying psychiatric comorbidities. The  majority of presentations occurred in prisoners (65%). The most commonly ingested  objects were batteries (23%), alleged drug-containing balloons (17%), razor  blades (16%), and miscellaneous (40%). High-risk ingestion occurred in  approximately two-thirds of presentations. Conservative management was the most  common approach in 55% of patients. Complications, defined as perforation, bowel  obstruction or fistula formation, did not occur in this cohort despite more than  half presenting with high-risk ingestions. Thirty-day re-presentation rates were  high (31%) and that was most common in patients with intentional ingestion,  underlying mental health disorders, and a documented history of self-harm.

Patients often present with nonspecific clinical symptoms, and diagnosis  is frequently delayed because they do not recall ingesting anything. We report  the case of a 20-year-old man who was admitted to the emergency room for acute  moderate hematemesis. The patient had no significant medical history. An urgent,  nonsedated upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy was performed, which revealed  bleeding but no foreign objects. However, an abdominal CT scan identified a  linear calcified object in the antrum, which was later confirmed to be a chicken  bone upon endoscopic extraction. Ingested foreign bodies typically pass through  the digestive tract without incident. However, long, sharp, and thin objects can  remain in the gastrointestinal tract for 7-10 days and may become lodged in areas  of physiological narrowing. This can lead to complications such as bowel  obstruction, perforation, or bleeding.",10.1016/j.radcr.2024.07.017,PubMed

Part A,Utilization of single-incision laparoscopy in the management of ingested magnets,"Background: A ban on neodymium magnets was lifted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission in 2016. Pediatric gastroenterologists and surgeons were  increasingly tasked with removing these problematic objects. The purpose of this  study was to assess the utility of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) in  the management of ingested magnets. Patients and Methods: This is a  single-center, retrospective assessment of surgical interventions for ingested  magnets. International Classification of Disease, 10th revision codes were used  to identify 349 patients ≤21 years of age evaluated for foreign body ingestion  over a 4.5-year period. A medical record review helped isolate 29 (8.3%) magnet  ingestions, 9 requiring surgical intervention. RedCap was used for analysis.  Results: Of 9 surgical patients, 7 underwent SILS intervention by 1 surgeon.  Another surgeon performed an open operation, whereas a third performed a  multiport operation. Of the 7 SILS cases, 3 were completed without conversion to  open. In one of these cases, bowel resection with primary anastomosis was  performed. For SILS cases, average operating room time was 109 minutes (38-170  minutes), time to enteral feeds was 23 hours (0.28-79.2 hours), and hospital  length of stay (LOS) was 3.8 days (1.96-6.68 days). Thirty-day readmission for  SILS was 14.3%. No other complications were observed. Conclusions: SILS has been  safely utilized for magnet retrieval. It offers an ability to identify the  affected intestinal segment and an opportunity to intervene extracorporeally  through an uncapped port. In addition, knowing where matted bowel is located can  direct a limited incision during conversion to laparotomy. This may confer  benefits of decreased pain, shortened time to enteral feeds, and decreased  hospital LOS.",10.1089/lap.2023.0394,PubMed

CASE PRESENTATION: A  36-year-old male patient (Aryan race) presented with complaints of chronic  abdominal pain, frequent vomiting, and intolerance to liquids and food. The  patient's companions mentioned a history of gradual ingestion of small metal  objects 3 months prior. The patient was conscious and had stable vital signs. In  the patient's X-ray and endoscopy, multiple metal objects inside the patient's  stomach were observed, causing gastric outlet obstruction.

The presentation of HNC can vary between developing and developed countries due to socioeconomic factors. The current study aimed to profile the swallowing function of HNC patients before starting radiation therapy in a tertiary hospital in India. Method: This cross-sectional observational study examined patients with HNC who were scheduled for radiation therapy. The Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) and Karnofsky Performance Status Scale were used to assess the patients’ swallowing status and functional abilities, respectively. The study also evaluated the relationship between swallowing function and clinical-demographic factors. Results: Our assessment of 162 HNC patients found that the cancer site significantly affects swallowing. Although 92% of patients had an oral diet, 64% made dietary modifications. Patients with non-oral intake had either oral or pharyngeal cancer, and over 80% of oral cancer patients and 60% of those with pharyngeal cancer had already made changes to their diet. Patients with laryngeal cancer had a better oral intake, with 58% reporting no swallowing issues. Conclusion: Patients with HNC scheduled for radiation therapy may experience varying degrees of swallowing difficulty. Early intervention and teaching of safe swallowing strategies are crucial to prepare for the potential worsening of swallowing difficulties resulting from the treatment.

Self-harm and suicide are associated with particular injuries and patterns of injury. Many of these patterns are apparent on imaging. Self-harm or suicidal intent may be overlooked initially in such cases, particularly when the patient is unconscious or uncooperative. Correct identification of these findings by the radiologist will allow a patient's management to be tailored accordingly and may prevent future suicide attempts. The initial role of the radiologists in these cases is to identify life-threatening injuries that require urgent medical attention. The radiologist can add value by drawing attention to associated injuries, which may have been missed on initial clinical assessment. In many cases of self-harm and suicide, imaging is more reliable than clinical assessment. The radiologist may be able to provide important prognostic information that allows clinicians to manage expectations and plan appropriately. Furthermore, some imaging studies will provide essential forensic information. Unfortunately, many cases of attempted suicide will end in brain death. The radiologist may have a role in these cases in identifying evidence of hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury, confirming a diagnosis of brain death through judicious use of ancillary tests and, finally, in donor screening for organ transplantation. A review is presented to illustrate the imaging features of self-harm, suicide, and brain death, and to highlight the important role of the radiologist in these cases. © 2024 The Royal College of Radiologists",10.1016/j.crad.2024.01.012,SCOPUS

Treatments include supportive therapy, antidotes (when available) and decontamination techniques with the aim of reducing drugs absorption by the gastrointestinal system to minimize toxicity. Nevertheless, the decontamination techniques currently used, such as gastric lavage (GL), activated charcoal or whole-bowel irrigation, have a questionable effectiveness. Endoscopic gastric decontamination (EGD) treatment for massive ingestion of drugs or formation of pharmacobezoars is currently described only in anecdotal cases. Here we describe the management of an intentional drug overdose in an adolescent patient treated with EGD and the effects of this therapy on drugs pharmacokinetics. Case report: A 15-year-old boy was admitted in an unconscious state (Glasgow Coma Scale: 7–8) to the pediatric intensive care unit after assuming an unspecified amount of quetiapine, aspirin, bisoprolol, fluoxetine, furosemide, alprazolam, and pregabalin pills. Rapid sequence intubation was immediately performed and then the patient was treated with symptomatic therapy and GL with minimal removal of gastric material. Accounting for the type of drugs, the time elapsed from oral assumption and the unknown quantity assumed, EGD was attempted with aim of removing potential aggregate of the drugs. Serial blood samples were taken before and after EGD to measure the plasma level of the drugs. A pharmacobezoar was found and was immediately removed with EGD. The results of the drug monitoring showed that quetiapine exceeded the toxic level reported in literature indicating that it may have been the drug assumed in higher quantity by our patient. PICU stay was uneventful, and the patient was transferred to the psychiatric ward after extubation. Discussion: Our case shows how GL is not effective in mitigating multidrug absorption especially drugs potentially inducing pharmacobezoars. Furthermore, based on our plasma drug monitoring, we believe that early EGD should be considered in all cases of massive pill intake, prolonged release drugs that can form pharmacobezoars or in cases where a life-threatening dose cannot be excluded.",10.1016/j.toxrep.2024.101683,Embase

It is induced by internal redistribution, decreased intestinal absorption, or urinary wasting. We present a case of multifactorial severe hypophosphatemia in the setting of chronic alcoholism and presumed refeeding syndrome. Case Description: A 69 year old male with a history of alcohol use disorder presented to the ED with generalized muscle weakness, recurrent falls and confusion. He reported consuming 2 bottles of wine daily for several years, with his last drink 24 hours prior to presentation. He reported a history of caloric restriction with intentional weight loss followed by a recent increase in caloric intake in the preceding week. His initial presentation was consistent with sepsis from contained sigmoid perforation due to foreign body ingestion, likely a chicken bone. Labs revealed phosphorus < 1, potassium 2.0, magnesium 1.4, lactate 8.5, WBC 6.1 with 34% band neutrophils, mild alkalosis (venous pH 7.43), pCO(2) 42, HCO(3) 24. He was admitted to the ICU and received volume resuscitation, IV antibiotics, management of alcohol withdrawal, intravenous phosphate, potassium and magnesium. Repeat labs showed improved phosphorus to 1.9, however serum corrected calcium decreased from 9.5 to 7.5 mg/dL. He continued to receive further repletion of electrolytes with eventual normalization. Discussion: The etiology of this patient's severe hypophosphatemia was multifactorial from chronic alcoholism and refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome was likely present in this case given the patient's malnutrition and weight loss with recent significantly increased caloric intake resulting in severe hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. His generalized muscle weakness can be explained by alcoholism and severe electrolyte derangements. Fortunately, he did not develop respiratory failure which is a complication of severe hypophosphatemia as a result of decreased intracellular ATP. For patients with severe hypophosphatemia (< 1 mg/dL), IV phosphate repletion is recommended with level monitoring every six hours. This patient developed hypocalcemia in the setting of phosphate repletion, which is a known complication and should be monitored closely.",10.1681/asn.0000000000000448,Embase

Here, we present an atypical case of foreign body aspiration. CASE PRESENTATION: An 18-year-old female with major depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder presented for foreign body aspiration. She shared that she uses a box cutter to inflict self-harm and hides it in her mouth. Inadvertently, she aspirated the box cutter and presented to the hospital for the same reason. Besides a mild sore throat, she denied cough, hemoptysis or shortness of breath. She was hemodynamically stable on room air. Her aspiration event was confirmed on a chest x ray, with a blade visualized in the right lower lobe. Pulmonology was consulted emergently with plans for a bronchoscopy the following morning. A CT chest was ordered to confirm the location of the box cutter. Before this was performed, the patient spontaneously expelled the blade by coughing overnight before any intervention took place. The patient did not suffer any consequence. DISCUSSION: Physiologically, the larynx plays a protective role in preventing foreign objects from being aspirated via the closure of the epiglottis, vocal cords and cough reflex (1). In the absence of risk factors, aspiration of foreign objects as in our patient is unlikely. Additionally, aspirated sharp foreign objects are extremely hazardous and pose a risk of catastrophic complications to the airway including hemorrhage, post obstructive pneumonia, lung abscess and bronchiectasis. Emergent intervention using rigid bronchoscopy is warranted as the spontaneous and uneventful expulsion of sharp objects as in our patient, is rare in literature (2). CONCLUSIONS: Foreign body aspiration of sharp objects calls for immediate intervention due to the risk of lethal complications, given that the occurrence of spontaneous and atraumatic expulsion is extremely rare.

Four patients needed additional surgery: two had tracheal  resection/anastomosis and esophageal repair for large tracheoesophageal fistulas;  one required aortic wall reinforcement with a patch; one underwent endoscopic  removal with a sternal split to explore the aortic arch. All 22 patients survived  and recovered clinically. One developed bilateral vocal cord palsy as a  complication. CONCLUSION: Effective management of DB ingestion complications  necessitates a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach. Our protocol has  improved management strategies and patient outcomes.",10.1007/s00383-024-05849-z,PubMed

Imaging can facilitate the selection of  appropriate treatment options and assist in differential diagnosis. Esophageal  obstruction in cattle is generally caused by greedy nature of chewing and  swallowing of food and foreign structures, including stones, potatoes,  trichobezoar, carrots, foodstuffs (i.e., hay), and rice chaff. Esophageal  obstruction in cattle can also be caused by artificial procedures, and early  detection and treatment are important to avoid severe esophageal injury and its  associated risks. Herein, an 11-month-old Japanese black heifer presented with  swelling and induration of the neck and snowball crepitation in the subcutaneous  area of the left shoulder. Radiography and endoscopy revealed a spring-like  foreign body in the esophagus and a cervical esophageal obstruction. Esophageal  surgery confirmed that the foreign body was a ruminal mechanical stimulating  brush (RB). The case died on day 8 after the initial examination. Pathological  necropsy revealed that the RB had entered the esophageal diverticulum and caused  esophageal obstruction. This case provides a valuable reminder about the risk of  esophageal disease with oral administration procedures.",10.1007/s11259-024-10582-y,PubMed
2024,"Smith, F.","Smith, F; Donaldson, J; Brown, T",Cochrane Database Of Systematic Reviews,Debridement for surgical wounds,"Abstract - Background Surgical wounds that become infected are often debrided because clinicians believe that removal of this necrotic or infected tissue may expedite wound healing. There are numerous methods of debridement available, but no consensus on which one is most effective for surgical wounds. Objectives To assess the effects of different methods of debridement on the rate of debridement and healing of surgical wounds. Search methods In October 2021, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. To identify additional studies, we searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies, reviews, meta‐analyses, and health technology reports. There were no restrictions on language, date of publication, or study setting. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people with a surgical wound that required debridement, and reported time to complete wound debridement or time to wound healing, or both. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment using the RoB 1 tool, data extraction, and GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence. Main results In this fourth update, we identified one additional study for inclusion. The review now includes six studies, with 265 participants, aged three to 91 years. Five studies were published between 1979 and 1990 and one published in 2014. The studies were carried out in hospital settings in China, Denmark, Belgium, and the UK. Six studies provided six comparisons. Due to the heterogeneity of studies, it was not appropriate to conduct meta‐analyses. Four studies evaluated the effectiveness of dextranomer beads/paste; however, each study used a different comparator (Eusol‐soaked dressings, 10% aqueous polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% chloramine‐soaked packs, and silicone foam elastomer dressing). One study compared streptokinase/streptodornase with saline‐soaked dressings, and one compared endoscopic surgical debridement with conventional 'open' surgical debridement. Five studies reported time to complete debridement (reported as time to a clean wound bed) and three reported time to complete healing. One study reported effect estimates (surgical debridement via endoscopy versus surgical debridement) for time to a clean wound bed and time to complete wound healing, and it was possible to calculate effect estimates for one other study (dextranomer paste versus silicone foam elastomer) for time to complete wound healing. For the other four studies that did not report effect estimates, it was not possible to calculate time to a clean wound bed or time to complete wound healing due to missing variance and participant exclusions. None of the included studies reported outcomes pertaining to proportion of wounds completely healed, rate of reduction in wound size, rate of infection, or quality of life. All studies had unclear or high risk of bias for at least one key domain. Dextranomer paste/beads (autolytic debridement) compared with four different comparators Four studies compared dextranomer paste or beads with Eusol‐soaked gauze (20 participants), 10% aqueous polyvinylpyrrolidone (40 participants), 0.1% chloramine‐soaked dressings (28 participants), or silicone foam elastomer (50 participants). There is very low‐certainty evidence that there may be no clear difference in time to a clean wound bed between dextranomer beads and Eusol gauze. The study did not report adverse events. There is very low‐certainty evidence that there may be no difference in time to a clean wound bed between dextranomer paste and 10% aqueous polyvinylpyrrolidone gauze. There was low‐certainty evidence that there may be no difference in deaths and serious adverse events. There may be a difference in time until the wounds were clinically clean and time to complete wound healing between dextranomer paste and 0.1% chloramine favouring 0.1% chloramine, but we are very uncertain. There is low‐certainty evidence that there may be no difference in deaths and serious adverse events. There is very low‐certainty evidence that there may be no difference in time to complete healing between dextranomer beads and silicone foam elastomer. The study did not report adverse events. Streptokinase/streptodornase solution (enzymatic) compared with saline‐soaked dressings One study (21 participants) compared enzymatic debridement with saline‐soaked dressings. There is low‐certainty evidence that there may be no difference in time to a clean wound bed or secondary suture between streptokinase/streptodornase and saline‐soaked dressings. There is very low‐certainty evidence that there may be no difference in deaths and serious adverse events. Surgical debridement via endoscopic ('keyhole') surgery compared with surgical debridement by 'open' surgery (the wound is opened using a scalpel) One study (106 participants) reported time to complete wound healing and time to a clean wound bed. There is low‐certainty evidence that there may be a reduction in time to complete wound healing and very low‐certainty evidence that there may be no difference in time to a clean wound bed with surgical debridement via endoscopy compared to 'open' surgical debridement. The study did not report adverse events. Overall, the evidence was low to very low‐certainty for all outcomes. Five included studies were published before 1991 and investigated treatments that are no longer available. Worldwide production of dextranomer products has been discontinued, except for dextranomer paste, which is currently only available in South Africa. Furthermore, Eusol, used in one study as the comparator to dextranomer, is rarely used due to risk of harmful effects on healthy tissue and the enzymatic agent streptokinase/streptodornase is no longer available worldwide. Authors' conclusions Evidence for the effects of different methods of debridement on complete wound debridement and healing of surgical wounds remains unclear. Adequately powered, methodologically robust RCTs evaluating contemporary debridement interventions for surgical wounds are needed to guide clinical decision‐making. Plain language summary Is there a best way to remove dead tissue from surgical wounds? Key message We cannot be certain whether removal of dead or infected tissue of surgical wounds or care that is usually provided makes any difference to how long it takes to remove all of the dead tissue from the wound and for the wound to heal. What did we want to find out? Following surgery, most surgical wounds heal naturally with no complications. However, complications such as infection can occur, which may result in delayed healing. There are many different methods of removing dead or infected tissue (called debridement), such as surgical removal of the tissue, enzymes (naturally occurring proteins that dissolve the tissue), and mechanical methods (for example, a special dry gauze that is removed when the tissue has stuck to it). We wanted to look at the different ways to remove dead or infected tissue from wounds after surgical operations and find out how they affect the time it takes to remove all of the dead tissue from the wound and for the wound to heal. What did we do? We searched medical databases for well‐designed studies including people of any age that compared one method of debridement versus a dummy treatment (placebo), no treatment, or another method of debridement after surgery. What did we find? We found six studies dating from 1979 to 2014 that compared different types of wound debridement with the way care was usually provided for wounds that had dead tissue within them after surgery. All six studies compared different types of debridement methods or different types of usual care, meaning we could not combine the results. The total number of participants within the studies was 265, and ages of participants ranged from three to 91 years. The studies were carried out in hospitals in China, Denmark, Belgium, and the UK. Four studies compared a treatment method that promotes the body's natural wound healing process (called autolytic) with different types of usual care. Overall, we found that this method may make little or no difference to how long it takes to remove all of the dead tissue. One study compared an enzyme with usual care, and we found that this method may make little or no difference to how long it takes to remove all of the dead tissue. One study compared different methods of removing dead tissue using surgery (one via 'keyhole' surgery, the other 'normal' surgery). We found that using keyhole surgery to remove the dead tissue may have little or no effect on time for the wound to heal, but we are very uncertain about the results. Only three of the studies (two autolytic and one using an enzyme) reported serious harmful events that led to discontinuation of treatment or hospital admission. There may be no difference in deaths and serious harmful events between the treatment methods. Overall, all the studies indicated that it is unclear whether any type of wound debridement is better than usual care at reducing time to remove all of the dead tissue, time to complete healing, serious harmful events that led to discontinuation of treatment, or hospital admission. What are the limitations of the evidence? Overall, we are very uncertain about the evidence, mainly because the studies had small numbers of people, and did not report the results well. Additionally, five studies used debridement products that are no longer used clinically. How up to date is the evidence? We searched for studies published up to October 2021.",10.1002/14651858.cd006214.pub5,Cochrane

It can be ingested intentionally or  accidentally. The small bowel bezoar prevalence ranges between 0.4 % and 4 %, and  the prevalence is less than 0.5 % for gastric bezoars. There are different types  of bezoars, but the mention of a plastic bezoar rarely appears in the literature.  To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a plastic bezoar in the  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old woman was admitted for  acute kidney injury, and while working her up, it was discovered that she had a  possible foreign body on computerized tomography scan. As a result, she underwent  exploratory laparotomy with the findings of plastic foreign objects identified  90 cm from the ileocecal valve and other objects identified in the stomach.  CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The impaction of these materials often occurs in narrow  areas such as the lower esophagus, duodenum, ileocecal valve or even the anus. In  this unique case, two points of impaction were noted: the first was in the small  bowel and the second point in the stomach. The approach to such cases could be  Endoscopic versus surgical or even chemical dissolution as a choice of treatment  is dependent on multiple factors. CONCLUSION: The approach to these cases is  multidisciplinary and depends on the availability of services and resources at  the treating hospital. Reporting such cases helps in managing challenging  situations. Additionally, a psychiatric assessment is a crucial step.",10.1016/j.ijscr.2024.109506,PubMed

PURPOSE: To evaluate the  potential value of computed tomography (CT) in guiding the selection of surgical  treatment for patients with ingested foreign bodies in the lower gastrointestinal  tract. METHODS: Between January 2014 and December 2023, we analyzed the data of  58 patients (median age: 65.4 years; range, 31-96 years) with ingested foreign  bodies in the lower gastrointestinal tract who underwent CT examinations.  Patients were treated either conservatively (35 cases) or surgically (23 cases).  The angle between the long axis of the foreign body and the intestinal canal  (FB-IC angle) was measured. CT findings and clinical variables were evaluated to  identify potential indicators for surgical treatment through univariate and  multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed  the FB-IC angle (P = 0.002), presence of free peritoneal gas (P = 0.002), white  blood cell count (P = 0.018), and neutrophil count (P = 0.007) as significant  factors associated with surgical treatment. Multivariate analysis demonstrated  that the FB-IC angle (odds ratio, 1.033; P = 0.045) and the presence of free  peritoneal gas (odds ratio, 41.335; P = 0.002) are independent indicators for  surgical management. The FB-IC angle showed an area under the receiver operating  characteristic curve of 0.755, with a cutoff value of 51.25 degrees. CONCLUSION:  The FB-IC angle and presence of free peritoneal gas serve as potential predictive  imaging markers for surgical intervention.",10.1007/s00261-024-04404-7,PubMed

METHODS: A  new CR2032 BB and artificial saliva were placed in a fresh pig esophagus with the  recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN); the negative electrode faced the nerve in the  experimental group, while the positive electrode faced the nerve in the control  group. The pH values of the intra- and extraesophageal walls were measured  simultaneously. Pathological examination was performed after the esophagus and  nerves were damaged. RESULTS: After BB ingestion, the pH near the intraesophageal  negative electrode increased rapidly, reaching 11.5 at 30 min and over 14 at 6 h,  while the extraesophageal pH did not change at 1 h and began to accelerate after  2 h, reaching 10 at 6 h. After 6 h of exposure, the pathological section showed  that the structure of the mucosa, submucosa, and muscle layer were destroyed;  chromatin in the nucleus faded, and part of the nerve bundle in the adventitia  had liquefaction necrosis. CONCLUSION: The basic mechanism of vocal cord  paralysis caused by BB ingestion is that the OH(-) generated by the electrolytic  reaction of the negative electrode penetrates the esophageal wall and corrodes  the RLN, which may be the cause of vocal cord paralysis caused by BB ingestion  without esophageal perforation.",10.1016/j.ijporl.2024.111872,PubMed
