\subsection*{Assessment of Reporting Bias}
Risk of bias due to missing results was not formally assessed with funnel plots or quantitative tests (e.g., Egger’s) for outcomes with fewer than 10 series, due to low power and high heterogeneity \cite{Afonso_2024, Sterne_2017}; for eligible variables, funnel plots were produced using standard error as the y-axis, with heterogeneity (I²) reported separately in Figure~\ref{fig:reml_meta}.
