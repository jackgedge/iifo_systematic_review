\subsection*{Effects Measures}
Univariate associations between binary predictors and binary outcomes were assessed using unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), via chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests~\cite{Machin_2008}. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors; adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95\% CIs were calculated from models including age, gender, motivation, and object characteristics. All models were fitted using \textit{statsmodels} in Python~\cite{Seabold_2010}. 

For case series, meta-analyses of proportions were conducted using random-effects models with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation and Hartung--Knapp (HK) adjustment to CIs, appropriate for small numbers of studies. DerSimonian--Laird (DL) estimates were also calculated for comparison. Univariate meta-regression was used to explore associations between study-level predictors and pooled outcome rates, using inverse-variance weighted regression. Full methodological details are provided in Appendix~\ref{appendix:effects_measures}.
