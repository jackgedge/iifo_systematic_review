\subsection*{Data Collection Process}
Data were initially extracted by a single reviewer (JGE) into Microsoft Excel \cite{MicrosoftCorporation_2025}. Variables for extraction were developed iteratively through engagement with the literature and analysis of consistent reporting patterns. A preliminary review of the first 30 case reports informed the development of additional data categories, which were subsequently applied to the remaining reports. 

Following initial extraction, data were imported into Python for further processing and analysis. The Python-based pipeline included data cleaning, validation, and transformation to ensure consistency across heterogeneous study formats. These structured data were then used to guide the extraction of aggregate data from case series. Studies were grouped for extraction based on their classification as case reports or case series. Where case series contained sufficiently granular data, cases were extracted individually and treated as case reports; otherwise, data were extracted at the aggregate level. Case grouping for analysis followed the criteria for inclusion as individual case reports or case series, as defined above. Relevant data from reviews and other literature types were recorded under the case report category.
