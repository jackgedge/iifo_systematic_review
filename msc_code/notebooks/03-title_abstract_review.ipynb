A key question for your exclusion criteria is: are you including children who swallow things like coins and magnets? It’s debatable whether these are ‘intentional’ – children often just put them in their mouths and accidentally swallow them. Even when they do intentionally swallow, it’s unlikely to be DSH. So it depends a bit on what you mean by ‘intentional’. Intending to put it in their mouth? Intending to swallow? Intending to cause themselves harm?\""
