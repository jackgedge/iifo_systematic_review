\subsection*{Objectives}
This systematic review aims to quantify the rates of endoscopy, surgery, death, complication and conservative management following intentional ingestion of foreign objects in human populations. It also seeks to examine how individual factors—such as demographic/population characteristics, object characteristics and motivations for ingestion—influence the likelihood of these outcomes.
