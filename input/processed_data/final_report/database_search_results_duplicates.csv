1991,"Bartels, K.","Bartels, K. E.; Stair, E. L.; Cohen, R. E.",Journal Of The American Veterinary Medical Association,Corrosion potential of steel bird shot in dogs,"Each year many dogs are accidentally or purposely wounded with shotguns. When lead pellets were used exclusively in the past, clinical problems from  chronically embedded shot seldom developed except for rare cases of lead  toxicosis. However, because expended lead shot ingested unintentionally by  waterfowl and other avian species is fatal, the US Fish and Wildlife Service  mandated exclusive use of steel shot for waterfowl hunting beginning in 1991. To  discover the effects of implanted steel shot in a biological system, in vitro and  in vivo studies were performed. Severe surface corrosion was evident when steel  shot was placed in physiologic saline solution and sterile canine plasma. Eight  laboratory dogs were surgically implanted with sterile steel shot in various  superficial locations for intervals of 2 to 26 weeks. Corrosion of implants and  tissue inflammation was observed in all biopsy specimens examined. It has been  shown that steel shot embedded in tissues will corrode and result in a severe  inflammatory response. If the accompanying inflammation is complicated by  bacterial contamination, foreign body reactions resulting in infected, draining  tracts could develop. Veterinarians and dog owners should be aware that treatment  and prognosis for wounds caused by steel shot may differ from those for similar  wounds caused by lead shot.",,PubMed

A minority of FB ingestions are not identified for weeks to years and present significant problems for retrieval. The purpose of this study was to describe the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies needed to care for children who have chronic esophageal FBs. Methods: Five children were identified as having retained esophageal FBs 2 months to 2 years after ingestion. During the same 3-year period, 100 children who had acute FBs were identified and had their foreign bodies removed endoscopically. The average age of the children was 3 years (range, 2.4 to 3.5). Results: The average age of the five children identified in th is study was 3 years. The items ingested included coins, a heart pendant, a clothespin spring, and a toy soldier. Complications from chronically retained foreign bodies were bronchoesophageal fistula, mediastinitis, esophageal diverticulum,and lobar atelectasis. One patient died from an aortoesophageal fistula. In all children, endoscopic removal was attempted. Barium esophagram was then performed, and foreign bodies were eventually removed via right thoracotomy. Conclusions: Long-retained esophageal FBs are extremely morbid and life threatening. History most often identifies excess salivation, new onset asthma, and/or recurrent upper respiratory infections. Three diagnostic adjuncts are helpful in identifying the presence of a long retained FB: (1) Chest x-ray (PA and lateral), (2) barium swallow, and (3) esophagoscopy. Indications for thoracotomy for removal of foreign body include (1) Poor endoscopic visualization of FB because of inflammatory tissue and (2) Herald bleeding during endoscopy.

Methods: Retrospective review of patients treated for esophageal coin ingestion at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin over a 1-year period using bougienage or endoscopic retrieval was conducted. (inclusion criterion) Results: Twenty-seven patients were evaluated over the 1-year study period. Two patients spontaneously passed the coins before arrival and needed no further treatment. Twelve patients met criteria for bougienage, and this treatment was successful in 10 of the 12 patients. Mean length of hospital Stay was 2.15 hours, and the mean cost was $546. Thirteen patients were treated successfully with endoscopy. The mean length of hospital stay was 22.7 hours, and the mean cost was $5,230. There were no complications in any of the 25 patients. Conclusions: Bougienage is equally safe, more efficient, and much less expensive than endoscopy for treatment of esophageal coins in properly selected patients. Nearly half of the patients were excluded from bougienage because of delayed presentation alone. Education of parents and physicians regarding symptoms of coin ingestion would allow primary treatment with bougienage in the majority of cases. Copyright (C) 1999 by W.B.

1999,"Cheng, W.","Cheng, W; Tam, PKH",Journal Of Pediatric Surgery,"Foreign-body ingestion in children: experience with 1,265 cases","Background/Purpose: This study aims to elucidate the clinical presentation, the effectiveness of investigations, and treatment of foreign body ingestion in children and to formulate an algorithm of management. Methods: The records of children admitted to a single institution who had a history of foreign body ingestion over 33 years were reviewed. Symptoms, radiological findings, and endoscopic findings were assessed. Results: Foreign bodies were detected in 552 (43%) of the 1,265 children admitted. The age of the children ranged from 6 months to 16 years (mean, 5.2 years). The preschool toddlers (mean age, 3.8 years) were most prone to ingest inanimate objects. The most common objects were coins (49%) and nonmetallic sharp objects (NMSO; 31%). Although x-rays could detect all the metallic objects and 86% of glass objects, the sensitivity of fish bone detection is only 26%. Absence of symptoms was common (50% in metallic group and 29% in NMSO group). Forty-one percent of coins and 95% of NMSO were lodged at sites suitable for removal by direct laryngoscopy alone with success rates of 86% and 77%, respectively. There were 3 disease-related complications and 1 mortality. Two of these children were mentally retarded and presented late. Conclusions: Efforts for prevention of ingestion of inanimate foreign body should focus on the preschool toddler group. Particular attention should be paid to mentally retarded children with vague gastrointestinal symptoms. Absence of symptoms does not preclude presence of foreign body in children. Children with history of NMSO ingestion should undergo direct laryngoscopy despite negative radiological finding, both as a screening procedure or treatment. J Pediatr Surg 34:1472-1476.

2001,"Vicente, Y.","Vicente, Y; Hernandez-Peredo, G; Molina, M; Prieto, G; Tovar, JA",Journal Of Pediatric Surgery,Acute food bolus impaction without stricture in children with gastroesophageal reflux,"Background/Purpose: This report identifies a group of children in whom severe acute food bolus impaction (AFBI) was the leading symptom of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in the absence of stricture. Methods: The esophageal structure and function of 8 patients treated for AFBI requiring endoscopic removal of alimentary foreign bodies in 6 of them (up to 4 times in 1 case) were investigated by barium meal, esophagoscopy-biopsy, pH-metering, pull-through stationary manometry, and 24-hour ambulatory manometry. The results were compared with those in a group of age-matched regular refluxers (n = 14) without AFBI. Results: Six boys and 2 girls aged 108 +/- 59 months had impaction. Six children had symptoms of GER like vomiting during infancy, heartburn, or respiratory tract disease. Barium swallow ruled out stenosis in all patients and showed small hiatal hernias in 3. All had endoscopic and histologic esophagitis (moderate to severe in 6), and one had Schatzki ring. All but one (who had 8.45 mm Hg) had normal lower esophageal sphincter pressure (16.2 +/- 4.7 mm Hg, mean +/- SID), and all showed normal sphincteric relaxation. Esophageal body motility was not significantly different from that in regular refluxers except in 6 children in whom energetic distal peristalsis after reflux episodes could be seen particularly during the night. Three of them had amazingly powerful distal waves during the day and even stronger, simultaneous, wide and bizarre-shaped waves during sleep. Symptoms improved in all cases after antireflux medication. Four patients were cured after antireflux surgery. Conclusions: AFBI is a dramatic but practically unheard of symptom of GER in children. It should be differentiated from dysphagia and reveals motor dysfunction, sometimes severe, of the esophageal body in the absence of sphincteric obstruction. Antireflux medication or surgery were uniformly successful in our patients. J Pediatr Surg 36:1397-1400, Copyright (C) 2001 by WB, Saunders Company.",10.1053/jpsu.2001.26381,Web of Science

A 22-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a 3-week history of abdominal pain. Upon initial history the patient denied any foreign body ingestion. Only after computed tomography (CT) scanning of the abdomen and pelvis did the patient admit to deliberate ingestion of a single United States penny coin. During surgical evaluation it was found that the coin had lodged near the ileocecal valve and an inflammatory mass had formed around the intraluminal coin, causing a 10 X 7 cm fibrous tumor to completely obstruct the small bowel. It is thought that oxidation of the coin, with subsequent exposure of its high zinc content, instigated the inflammatory cascade. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.jemermed.2004.03.013,Web of Science

Methods: Retrospective chart review was performed. Patients were identified using ICD-9 code for esophageal foreign body. Clinical data and management techniques, along with complications were abstracted. Results: For the 5-year period of review, 255 patients were identified with an esophageal foreign body. 214 children had a witnessed ingestion. The mean age of the unwitnessed ingestion group was 2.3 years, compared to 4.6 years for a witnessed ingestion. In both groups, mates and females were distributed equally and the most common ingested object was a coin. Bivariate, unadjusted analysis revealed history of wheeze (OR, 4.35) and fever (OR, 11.15) had the largest association with patients who had an unwitnessed ingestion. Multivariate analysis indicated any physical findings of wheeze, rhonchi, stridor, or retractions were associated significantly with a diagnosis of an unwitnessed foreign body. Children less than 2 years of age and with a documented fever are also predictive of an unwitnessed ingestion. Eleven children (4.3%) with esophageal abnormalities were also noted to have foreign bodies. Conclusions: Children who present to the emergency department two years old and younger, who have a documented fever and with respiratory findings should be considered at risk for having a retained esophageal foreign body. Children with esophageal abnormalities may also be at risk for retained esophageal foreign bodies.",10.1097/01.pec.0000177196.83655.91,Web of Science

2006,"Waltzman, M.","Waltzman, ML",Current Opinion In Pediatrics,Management of esophageal coins,"Purpose of review Coins are the most commonly ingested foreign body encountered in the pediatric population. Coins that are in the esophagus and are causing symptoms (cough, stridor, respiratory distress, drooling or pain) are managed with immediate removal via various methods. Asymptomatic coins have been a perplexing problem to the clinician for decades, with some advocating for immediate removal while others are proponents of 'watchful waiting'. Recent findings This article will provide a review of the current literature on management options for symptomatic and asymptomatic esophageal coins. The article will discuss clinical decision-making strategies for the diagnosis of the unwitnessed ingestion, as well as diagnostic studies, such as plain radiographs, as well as novel modalities, such as metal detectors. Discussion of the anatomic issues related to esophageal foreign bodies will be addressed. Treatment i options for asymptomatic patients will be reviewed utilizing data from retrospective studies as well as a prospective randomized trial. Summary In the symptomatic patient with an esophageal coin, immediate removal via endoscopy is recommended. For the asymptomatic patient with an esophageal coin, current data support expectant management for a period of 12-24 h with the hope of spontaneous passage and avoidance of general anesthesia and surgical procedure.",10.1097/01.mop.0000245361.91077.b5,Web of Science

This study aims toevaluate a management protocol where endoscopic examination was only selectively used after routine direct laryngoscopy to minimize patient discomfort and the need for general anesthesia in children. Method: A management protocol for foreign body ingestion based on symptoms was introduced in 1998 and records of children admitted to a university-affiliated hospital between January 1999 and October 2005 with suspected foreign body ingestion were evaluated. Symptoms, radiologic and endoscopic findings, and outcome were reviewed. Results: A total of 282 patients were admitted. The mean age of patients was 5.75 years (range, 9 months to 17 years). There were 167 boys and 115 girls. Based on our protocol, 84 (29.8%) patients required an upper endoscopy. Fish bones were most commonly involved (68.8%). Foreign bodies, which were either removed or dislodged, were found during upper endoscopy in only 25 (8.8%) patients overall. All patients had an uneventful outcome. No complications or mortalities were encountered. There were no readmissions for those who did not undergo endoscopic examination. Conclusion: It is safe to selectively perform upper endoscopy depending on symptoms when managing children with foreign body ingestion. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

2007,"Dahshan, A.","Dahshan, AH; Donovan, GK",Journal Of Clinical Gastroenterology,Bougienage versus endoscopy for esophageal coin removal in children,"Background: Foreign body ingestion is a common pediatric problem. Coins are by far the most common ingested foreign bodies. When ingested coins become lodged in the esophagus, they may cause serious complications if they are not removed in a timely manner. Endoscopic removal is the preferred treatment in many pediatric centers as its safety and effectiveness are well established. Objectives: We performed this study to evaluate safety and effectiveness of an alternative method of managing esophageal coins, using bougienage technique. Methods: Previously healthy children presenting to the local emergency room with uncomplicated, witnessed coin ingestion of less than 24 hours duration were prospectively recruited with an intent-to-treat analysis. A single oral passage of a Hurst bougie dilator was performed by a gastroenterologist to dislodge the esophageal coin into the stomach. If bougienage was successful (x-ray showing coin in the stomach), patients were discharged and instructions were given for monitoring stools until passage of the coin through anus was confirmed. If bougienage was unsuccessful, the child developed symptoms at any time or if a coin remained intragastric for 4 weeks, endoscopic removal was planned. Children whose parents declined to participate in the bougienage treatment received the standard endoscopic removal and their hospital records were used as controls. Results: A total of 10 children were enrolled in this study, with a mean age of 3.2 years (I I mo to 10 y), 6 boys and 4 girls. All received little or no sedation. Nine children (90%) were successfully treated using bougienage, all of whom spontaneously passed the ingested coins, with a mean duration of 2.6 days (I to 7 d) without subsequent intervention. A single case failed bougienage and underwent endoscopic removal. Three children declined bougienage treatment and underwent endoscopic removal. There were no reported minor or major adverse events with any of our cases. The mean health care cost for the hospital visit for bougienage treatment was $1210, compared with $3100 for the endoscopic removal (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the mean time spent in the hospital from diagnosis to discharge was 2 hours for bougienage-treated patients compared with 8 hours for endoscopic treatment (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Bougienage of impacted esophageal coins is an effective, safe, and more economic treatment modality for selected pediatric patients with uncomplicated coin ingestion. This simple technique may provide a valuable tool to emergency room physicians or primary care doctors especially when endoscopy is not readily available.",10.1097/01.mcg.0000225622.09718.5f,Web of Science

Objective: To describe the characteristics and management of foreign-body ingestions, with predominantly intentional ingestion, in a lower socioeconomic Status population. Design: A retrospective case series. Setting: An urban county hospital. Patients: Patients >= 17 years old, with foreign-body ingestions between 2000 and 2006. Main Outcome Measurements: Characteristics of ingestion cases, endoscopic extraction, need for surgery, and complications. Results: Among 262 cases, 92% were intentional, 85% involved psychiatric patients, and 84% Occurred in patients with prior ingestions. The time from ingestion to presentation was >48 hours in 168 cases (64%). T lie overall Success rate for endoscopic extraction was 90% (165/183 cases). Surgery was performed in 30 cases (11%) and was more common for objects beyond the pylorus versus objects above the pylorus (16/43 [37%] vs 10/151 [7%], respectively) and in cases with a greater delay from ingestion to presentation (25/168 [15%] if >48 hours vs 4/77 [5%] if <= 48 hours') and from presentation to intervention (15/40 [38%] if >48 hours vs 14/165 [8%] if <= 48 hours). Perforation occurred in 16 cases (6%), with 6 perforations noted after endoscopy. Limitation: A retrospective review of medical records. Conclusions: Foreign-body ingestions in an Urban county hospital occurred primarily in psychiatric patients who had repeated episodes of intentional ingestions. Endoscopic extraction Was unsuccessful in 10% of cases. Long delays from ingestion to presentation and intervention may account for relatively high rates of surgery and perforation. Strategies to prevent ingestions and delays in endoscopic management are needed in this population. (Gastrointest Endosc 2009;69:426-33.)",10.1016/j.gie.2008.05.072,Web of Science

The medical information system of a children's hospital was searched with key terms to identify cases in which a witnessed or self-reported inadvertent ingestion of a beverage-can stay-tab resulted in a radiograph to rule out presence of a foreign body. Demographics, identification of stay-tab on radiographs, associated abnormalities, and patient management were reviewed. Nineteen cases of stay-tab ingestion were identified over 16 years. Mean age of ingesters was 8.5 years with the majority being teenagers and 15 (79%) > 5 years of age. The stay-tab could be seen radiographically only in 4 (21%) cases-all with the stay-tab identified in the stomach. The identification of 19 children who inadvertently ingested beverage-can stay-tabs at a single children's hospital suggests that such ingestions still occur.

Methods: The medical records of 249 patients who ingested FBs were reviewed. In addition, they were studied by telephone questionnaires to follow up spontaneously passed FB. The factors associated with SP such as age, the type, size, and initial location of the FBs were analyzed. Results: Foreign bodies were spontaneously passed in 145 patients (58.2%), endoscopic removal was performed in 100 patients (40.2%), and operative removal was performed in 4 patients (1.6%). Most SP FBs were passed within 5 days. The SP rates (SPRs) according to the initial location were the following: 12.2% for the esophagus (P < 0.0001), 71.4% for the stomach, 85.7% for the small bowel, and 96.4% for the colon. There was no significant difference in the SPR according to age. When coins and disk batteries that required early endoscopic removal were excluded, the SPR was 63.4% for FBs less than 10 mm, 80.4% for FBs 10 to 20 mm, 72.8% for FBs 20 to 30 mm, and 50.0% for FBs more than 30 mm (P = 0.091).

Presenting symptoms, clinical examination, and laboratory findings can guide selection of diagnostic imaging. Recent findings Intussusception and intestinal malrotation are potentially serious causes of intestinal obstruction, which are best evaluated by ultrasound and upper gastrointestinal series, respectively. Ultrasound has diagnostic importance in the evaluation of multiple diseases, including appendicitis, by potentially decreasing the need for inpatient observation, cholecystitis and complications of gall stones such as pancreatitis, and ovarian diseases. Pelvic inflammatory disease should be considered in evaluation of a teenage girl with lower abdominal pain. Less common causes of acute abdominal pain include ingested foreign bodies, infected congenital anomalies, and perforated peptic ulcer disease. Summary Presenting symptoms and physical examination findings can narrow the number of potential diagnoses in pediatric acute abdominal pain and thereby guide diagnostic imaging selection.

2013,"Fitzgerald, K.","Fitzgerald, KT; Bronstein, AC",Topics In Companion Animal Medicine,Polyurethane adhesive ingestion,"Polyurethane adhesives are found in a large number of household products in the United States and are used for a variety of purposes. Several brands of these expanding wood glues (those containing diphenylmethane diisocyanate [MDI]) have the potential to form gastrointestinal (GI) foreign bodies if ingested. The ingested adhesive forms an expanding ball of glue in the esophagus and gastric lumen. This expansion is caused by a polymerization reaction using the heat, water, and gastric acids of the stomach. A firm mass is created that can be 4-8 times its original volume. As little as 2 oz of glue have been reported to develop gastric foreign bodies. The obstructive mass is reported to form within minutes of ingestion of the adhesive. The foreign body can lead to esophageal impaction and obstruction, airway obstruction, gastric outflow obstruction, mucosal hemorrhage, ulceration, laceration, perforation of the esophageal and gastric linings, and death. Clinical signs following ingestion include anorexia, lethargy, vomiting, tachypnea, and abdominal distention and pain, and typically develop within 12 hours. Clinical signs may depend upon the size of the mass. If left untreated, perforation and rupture of the esophagus or stomach can occur. The glue mass does not stick to the Cl mucosa and is not always detectable on abdominal palpation. Radiographs are recommended to confirm the presence of the glue-ball foreign body, and radiographic evidence of the obstruction may be seen as early as 4-6 hours following ingestion. Emesis is contraindicated owing to the risk of aspiration of the glue into the respiratory tree or the subsequent lodging of the expanding glue mass in the esophagus. Likewise, efforts to dilute the glue and prevent the formation of the foreign body through administration of liquids, activated charcoal, or bulk-forming products to push the foreign body through the Cl tract have proven ineffective. Even endoscopy performed to remove the foreign body has been shown to be unreliable. The safest, most effective, and successful therapy is surgical intervention to remove the Cl foreign body. If performed early enough, complete recovery of the animal can be expected. Differential diagnoses for polyurethane adhesive ingestion include any potential cause of GI obstruction. The public is largely unaware of the hazards that ingestion of this product may produce. Public education efforts are needed to inform pet owners about the hazards of these glues and the overall importance of providing our companion animals with safe, poison-free environments.

Our objective is to propose a decisional algorithm for management of foreign body ingestion in prisoners. We reviewed the records of 198 admissions for foreign body ingestion for a 10- year period. Type and number of ingested foreign bodies, radiographic findings, outcome as well as the management method including conservative, endoscopic removal, or surgical treatment were analyzed. Most cases were managed conservatively (87.6%). Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract was performed in 37 cases with a success rate of 46 per cent. In 9.3 per cent of cases, the final treatment was endoscopic. Only five patients required surgical treatment, being emergent just in one case. We advocate conservative treatment for asymptomatic patients with foreign body ingestion. Endoscopic removal is proposed for pointed objects or objects bigger than 2.5 cm located in the stomach. Objects longer than 6 to 8 cm located in the stomach should be removed by endoscopy or laparoscopy. Patients with objects in the small bowel or colon should be treated conservatively unless there are complications or they fail to progress.",,Web of Science

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 194 patients with a diagnosis of foreign body impaction in the upper gastrointestinal tract, confirmed by endoscopy, at two university hospital in South Korea. Patient demographic data, including age, gender, intention to ingestion, symptoms at admission, and comorbidities, were collected. Clinical features of the foreign bodies, such as type, size, sharpness of edges, number, and location, were analyzed. Endoscopic data those were analyzed included duration of foreign body impaction, duration of endoscopic performance, endoscopic device, days of hospitalization, complication rate, 30-d mortality rate, and the number of operations related to foreign body removal. RESULTS: The types of upper gastrointestinal foreign bodies included fish bones, drugs, shells, meat, metal, and animal bones. The locations of impacted foreign bodies were the upper esophagus (57.2%), mid esophagus (28.4%), stomach (10.8%), and lower esophagus (3.6%).

In order to avoid complications such as perforation, endoscopic removal of potentially penetrating foreign bodies should be attempted quickly. The use of various endoscopic techniques has been reported for this purpose. However, extraction of foreign bodies from the mid gastrointestinal tract has rarely been reported. Case Report: We present the case of a patient who had swallowed a safety needle which could safely be removed from the jejunum by means of double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE). The combination of a thin p-type enteroscope with a thick t-type overtube was used in order to improve the manoeuvrability of the endoscope. The needle was pulled into the overtube which served as a protective shield during the retrieval of the endoscope. Conclusion: Our case report describes the potential of removing foreign bodies from the deep small bowel by pulling them into the overtube of a double-balloon enteroscope. If the suspicion of foreign body impaction in the small bowel is made, it may be advisable to primarily choose a balloon enteroscopy system. Through this, quick and deep insertion can be combined with a safe removal of the foreign body.",10.1055/s-0035-1553196,Web of Science

Methods: Patients admitted with ingested foreign bodies were identified in the Kids Inpatient Database (1997-2009). Results: Overall, 7480 cases were identified. Patients were most commonly < 5 years of age (44%), male (54%), and Caucasian (57%). A total of 2506 procedures were performed, GI surgical procedures (57%) most frequently, followed by GI endoscopy (24%), esophagoscopy (11%), and bronchoscopy - in cases of inhaled objects (9%). On multivariate analysis, length of stay increased when cases were associated with intestinal obstruction (OR = 1.7), esophageal perforation (OR = 40.0), intestinal perforation (OR = 4.4), exploratory laparotomy (OR = 1.9), and gastric (OR = 2.9), small bowel (OR = 1.5), or colon surgery (OR = 2.5), all p < 0.02. Higher total charges (TC) were associated with intestinal obstruction (OR = 2.0), endoscopy of esophagus (OR = 1.8), stomach (OR = 2.1), or colon (OR = 3.3), and exploratory laparotomy (OR = 3.6) or surgery of stomach (OR = 5.6), small bowel (OR = 6.4), or colon (OR = 3.4), all p < 0.001. Conclusions: Surgical or endoscopic procedures are performed in approximately one third of GIFB cases. Associated psychiatric disorder or self-inflicted injury is seen inmore than 20% of GIFB patients. Resource utilization is determined heavily by associated diagnoses and treatment procedures.

Here, we report a case of intentionally swallowed coins in the oesophagus of an adult; the coins could not be detected on chest radiography but were detected using computed tomography (CT). Case presentation: A 46-year-old woman with a history of depression presented to the emergency department after an intentional medication overdose and ingestion of two Japanese 1-yen coins. She complained of persistent retrosternal discomfort. In order to confirm whether the coins were in the oesophagus or trachea, an anteroposterior chest radiograph was obtained; however, no coins were detected. Owing to her persistent symptoms, a chest CT was performed. On the initial CT scan, two 1-yen coins were observed in the oesophagus: one in the middle oesophagus and the other in the lower oesophagus. After the scanning, the patient drank water with permission, but vomited. No coins were found in her vomit, and the symptoms of retrosternal discomfort had completely disappeared. A subsequent CT scan revealed that the two 1-yen coins were in the patient's stomach. Conclusions: Japanese 1-yen coins are made of 100% aluminium, which is less radiopaque than the metals that make up coins (nickel, bronze, and lead), and so, they were not visible via chest radiography in our case. Detecting very small or thin radiolucent foreign bodies is not possible using a chest radiograph or contrast oesophagram, but is possible via CT. CT is both increasingly convenient and non-invasive, unlike endoscopy or bronchoscopy, and so, the use of CT scans should be considered in cases of possible radiolucent foreign body ingestion.",10.1186/s12245-017-0153-8,Web of Science

Increasing prevalence of smaller, more technologically advanced toys in the household has resulted in an increased exposure to higher voltage batteries and powerful magnets that carry a high incidence of morbidity and mortality. This review highlights the latest findings regarding the patients at risk for button battery and magnet ingestions, the symptoms of presentation, and complications of these objects in contributing to long-standing gastrointestinal injury. Recent findings Button batteries may lead to esophageal injury within a few hours. Batteries retained in the esophagus are larger in diameter on average and size is associated with esophageal impaction as well as higher grade esophageal injury. Magnet ingestions, when multiple or with another metallic object, are often initially asymptomatic but may have acute worsening, and therefore warrant close monitoring. Summary Button battery and magnet ingestions have increased in incidence over the past two decades. Recent literature demonstrates that higher voltage, larger lithium button batteries, and prevalence of high-powered magnets can lead to significant morbidity.

We report a case of meat bolus with cartilaginous component impacted in the cervical esophagus, with a brief literature review. Case Report: A 64-year-old man came to our attention for retention in the cervical esophagus of a piece of meat accidentally swallowed during lunch. After a few attempts of endoscopic removal carried out previously in other hospitals, the patient has been treated by us with a cervical esophagotomy and removal of the foreign body, without any complications. We checked the database of PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library from January 2007 to January 2017 in order to verify the presence of randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, retrospective studies, and case series regarding the use of the cervical esophagotomy for the extraction of foreign bodies impacted in the esophagus. Conclusions: The crucial point is to differentiate the cases that must be immediately treated from those requiring simple observation. Endoscopic treatment is definitely the first therapeutic option, but in case of failure of this approach, in our opinion, cervical esophagotomy could be a safe, easy, viable, durable approach for the extraction of foreign bodies impacted in the cervical esophagus.

In this report, we present a rare case of razor blades lodged in the appendix as a result of intentional ingestion. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 25 year old male prisoner presented to our hospital with persistent right iliac fossa pain after razor blade ingestion. After 5 days of conservative management, there was no sign of transition on serial X-Rays. Laparoscopy with intraoperative image intensification confirmed the presence of the razor blades in the appendix and appendicectomy was subsequently performed without complications. DISCUSSION: Most ingested objected with diameter less than 2.5 cm and length less than 6 cm can pass through the gastrointestinal tract spontaneously in less than one week. The entry of foreign objects into the appendix is thought to be due to relative low motility of the caecum, the dependent position of the appendix and the size of the appendiceal orifice. Radiographic localisation to the appendiceal lumen was complicated by metallic artefact, but was consistent with failure to transit. Appendicectomy was felt to be the safest mode of retrieval. CONCLUSION: Ingested foreign body lodged in the appendix is a rare event. Once the exact location is confirmed, a simple laparoscopic appendicectomy can be performed to facilitate the removal.

Recent findings Foreign body ingestion (FBI) is a problem that is frequently encountered by pediatric providers. As new toys and products enter the marketplace, there may also be new dangers from those objects not initially recognized. Some of the recent trends and findings in pediatric FBI include an increase in adolescent injury from ingestion of laundry detergent pods because of a popular game where participants are encouraged to bite or swallow the pods, and injuries associated with ingesting parts of a popular toy known as a 'Fidget Spinner'. Summary Adverse events resulting from FBI range the entire gamut from nonexistent or minor symptoms to moderate injury and rarely may be fatal. Factors such as age, type of object ingested, anatomic location of the foreign body, and timing from ingestion to receipt of medical attention all determine the risk posed to the child and guide management decisions.

Methods: Children <18 years old who ingested a battery between 1/2011 and 9/2016 at two tertiary care children's hospitals were reviewed. Demographics, imaging, management and outcomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square and Wilcoxon Rank-sum tests. Results: There were 180 battery ingestions. The median age was 3.9 (range 0.7-18) years. with 78 (43%) males. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain (17%) and nausea/vomiting (14%). Diagnosis was confirmed with plain radiographs in 170 (94%) patients. Locations on imaging were: stomach (37%), small bowel (24%), esophagus (18%), colon (11%), and non-specific location past the gastroesophageal junction (9%). Treatment was dictated by five different subspecialties including surgery (35%), gastroenterology (25%), emergency medicine (19%), primary care/emergency with a consulting service (13%), and otolaryngology (8%). All esophageal batteries (n = 33) had an intervention.

Commonly, majority of cases require no specific treatment and the swallowed objects pass through the digestive tract spontaneously without causing any significant complications. Less than 1% of the cases complicates with gastrointestinal tract perforation, which are often caused by sharp objects, which warrants surgical intervention. The average time from foreign body ingestion to development of perforation was noted at 10.4 days in previous reports. These cases often present in rapidly progressing peritonitis and are subsequently managed by emergent laparotomy. In this case report, we describe an accidental chopstick ingestion of a patient who initially was misdiagnosed and remained asymptomatic for nine months, then presented with acute abdomen. Case presentation A 27-year-old man accidentally ingested a wooden chopstick and sought consult at a clinic. Negative abdominal plain film misled the physician to believe ingested chopstick was digested into fragments and passed out unnoticed. The patient presented acute abdomen caused by duodenal perforation nine months later and was subsequently treated with emergency laparotomy with primary duodenorrhaphy.

Small objects pass spontaneously; however, larger ones may get stuck in the oesophagus, stomach or at narrow areas of the bowel. 'Body packers' is a term used to describe persons who swallow or insert drug-filled packets into a body cavity. They are also called 'swallowers', 'internal carriers', 'couriers' or 'mules'. We report a 37-year-old previous drug abuser who presented with dysphagia. Upper GI endoscopy showed an oblong foreign body covered in plastic in the lower oesophagus. This could not be extracted and hence was pushed into the stomach. Three weeks later, he presented with bowel obstruction that was shown on abdominal radiograph and confirmed by CT indicating multiple dilated small bowel loops with a transition point in the terminal ileum where the ingested package was identified. The package was then removed through a longitudinal enterotomy. Ingested foreign bodies causing dysphagia should ideally be extracted endoscopically.

Only a few cases of peritonitis or intra-abdominal abscesses secondary to perforation of the digestive tract by an ingested foreign body have been reported. The most common sites of impaction and perforation include the appendix, cecum and the terminal ileum. The rectum is an unusual site of foreign body impaction. This report intends to highlight that ingested foreign body impacted in the rectum is an extremely rare cause of perianal abscess and subsequent fistula in infants. CASE SUMMARY Two cases of perianal abscess and fistula due to ingested jujube pit impacted in the rectum are reported. Both cases are infants with free previous medical history suffered from recurrent perianal infection. The caregivers of the two patients denied ingestion of a foreign body or any history of trauma. Physical examination combined with ultrasound or computed tomography scan established the diagnosis. Both of the patients underwent operation under general anesthesia. In case 1, a jujube pit with sharp ends was discovered embedded within a subcutaneous fistula. The jujube pit was then removed intact along with fistula resection. The wound was successfully laid open to allow healing by secondary intention. In case 2, a jujube pit was found with its sharp end puncturing the rectum, surrounded by pus and necrotic tissue. Subsequent incision and adequate drainage were performed. The whole jujube pit was then removed from the abscess cavity at the same time. Both patients received colonoscopy to rule out inflammatory bowel disease or other potential damages by the ingested jujube pit. The postoperative period was uneventful. At 1.5 year follow-up, no recurrent abscess or fistula were found in either patient.

Methods Medical records of 74 pediatric patients from 9 large Chinese hospitals during the past 10 years, who were diagnosed as buckyball magnets ingestion and got invasive treatment, were retrospectively studied. The follow-up was through telephone and outpatient service to estimate the post-surgery condition. Information collection was through online questionnaire. Results Among the 74 cases, there were 50 boys (68%) and 24 girls (32%). The median age was 36 (interquartile range (IQR) 22-77) months, with a range of 7 months to 11 years, and it showed two peaks, the first between 1 and 3 years, and the second between 6 to 11 years. The annual case number showed a sharp increase over time, and the total case number in the last 2 years (2017 and 2018) showed a greater than 9-fold increase when compared with the first 2 years (2013 and 2014). The majority of ingestions were unintentional, with only 3 patients deliberately swallowing the Buckyball magnets. The median time of ingestion until the onset of emergent symptoms was 2 (IQR 1-5) days, and ranged from 4 h to 40 days. Twenty-one patients had no symptoms, and the remaining cases presented with abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, abdominal distension, excessive crying, melena, and the ceasing of flatus and defecation. Gastroscopy, colonoscopy, laparoscopic surgery and laparotomy surgery were performed in accordance with the algorithm from the North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN). Procedural and operative findings included gastrointestinal mucosa erosion, ischemia and necrosis, perforation, and abdominal abscess, fistula and intestinal obstruction. The median number of Buckyball magnets ingested was 4 (IQR 2-8), with a range from 1 to 39. During the median follow-up period of 6 (IQR 1-15) months, 3 patients had intestinal obstruction, and one underwent a second operation. The remaining 71 patients courses were uneventful during the follow-up period. None of the 74 patients reported a second swallowing of foreign bodies. Conclusions The incidence of pediatric gastrointestinal tract magnets ingestion in China is increasing. Management of such patients should follow the NASPGHAN algorithm.

The aortic injury caused by a perforating esophageal foreign body is rare but lethal. The optimal management still remains controversial. The purpose of this report is to describe our experience in the management of the aortic injury caused by esophageal foreign body ingestion. Methods: Between January 2015 and December 2015, we retrospectively enrolled cases of esophageal perforation involving the aorta by foreign body. The general parameters, esophageal foreign body, types of aortic injury, treatment, and outcome were analyzed. Additionally, we reviewed the literature of the management of esophageal perforation involving the aorta caused by foreign bodies. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, and the need for informed consent was waived (Quick review 2019, No. 609). Results: Three cases of esophageal perforation involving the aorta by foreign body was selected in the study. Two male and 1 female patients (range, 51-58 years old) with the aorta involvement caused by a perforating foreign body in the esophagus in 3 forms were identified, including 1 patient with mycotic aortic pseudoaneurysm, 1 patient with aortoesophageal fistula and 1 patient with the aortic intramural hematoma. One patient died of the rupture of the pseudoaneurysm during the preparation of the surgery. The other 2 patients were cured with a multidisciplinary approach, which is an urgent thoracic endovascular aortic repair followed by mediastinal debridement/drainage or endoscopic retrieval. Two of 3 patients were survived until now. Conclusion: The management of the aortic injury caused by esophageal foreign body injury is challenging.

Our study aimed to compare the prevalence of different age, gender, types, locations and management of FB ingested between intentional ingestion and accidental ingestion of FB in Northern China. Methods A retrospective case series studied all patients with suspected FB ingestion in Digestive Endoscopy Center of Beijing Friendship Hospital, between January 2011 and January 2019. The patients were divided into 2 groups. Group A included the patients who intentionally ingested FBs, and Group B included the patients who accidentally ingested FBs. Patients' database (demographics, past medical history, characteristics of FB, endoscopic findings and treatments) were reviewed. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software. Results Group A consisted of 77 prisoners, 2 suspects and 11 psychologically disabled persons. Group B consisted of 1020 patients with no prisoners, suspects or psychologically disabled persons. In Group A, there were no food-related foreign bodies, and the majority of FBs were metallic objects (54.44%). However in Group B, food-related FBs were the most common (91.37%). In Group A, 58 cases (64.44%) were located in the stomach, while in Group B, 893 cases (87.55%) were located in the esophagus (P < 0.05). 1096 patients successfully underwent endoscopic removal and 14 failed, including 9 cases in Group A and 5 cases in Group B. The duration of FBs impaction was longer in Group A than that in Group B (P < 0.05). Conclusions In our study, the patients who intentionally ingested FB were mainly prisoners, FBs were mostly sharp metallic objects, the duration of FBs impaction was longer, and the rate of successful endoscopic treatment was lower than that of the general population.

History and physical examination are commonly not enough to diagnose a foreign body ingestion; therefore, conventional radiography is routinely used to detect them. Point-of-care ultrasound is widely used in the emergency department for several diagnostic applications but there are few articles describing the possibility to use point-of-care ultrasound to detect ingested foreign bodies, and the necessary training to get competent in this application. The main objective of this paper is to illustrate the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to detect ingested foreign bodies. The secondary objective is to describe a limited training, necessary for emergency pediatricians, to obtain this skill. Methods This is a case series of eight pediatric patients who presented to the pediatric Emergency Department (ED), with suspected ingestion of FB, and were assessed with POCUS. Physician sonographers were two pediatricians and three residents in pediatrics working in two Italian Pediatric EDs. All sonographers participated in a 2-day POCUS workshop which included the most common pediatric POCUS applications. Results POCUS, performed by emergency pediatricians who participated to a limited training, allowed to always identify the foreign bodies ingested. Conclusions We demonstrate that an appropriate and limited training allows pediatric emergency physicians to correctly identify foreign body in the esophagus or stomach. Point-of-care ultrasound in foreign body ingestion in the Emergency Department may allow to prioritize the escalation of care in children and it can contribute to reduce the time to endoscopic management when needed.",10.1007/s40477-020-00452-z,Web of Science

Timing of endoscopy relies on foreign body shape and size, localization in gastrointestinal tract, patient's clinical conditions, occurrence of symptoms, or onset of complications. We present a case of a 47-year-old male with no known comorbidity, who accidentally swallowed a portion of a naso-pharyngeal swab half-broken during the second diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2. The intact swab had a total length of 15 cm and was made of wood. The patient was asymptomatic, laboratory tests were normal, and neck-chest-abdominal X-ray and CT scan were negative for major complications. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was promptly performed to prevent the long sharp swab from crossing the pylorus leading to serious complications and, therefore, risk surgical intervention. The patient was intubated and the procedure was carried out under general anesthesia. In the gastric body, broken naso-pharyngeal swab was detected among the food debris, and using a latex rubber hood, the 7.5 cm foreign body was removed with a retrieval alligator-tooth forceps.

2021,"Masood, M.","Masood, M",American Journal Of Case Reports,"Intentional foreign body ingestions: a complex, recurrent and costly issue","Objective: Rare disease Background: Recurrent intentional foreign body (RIFB) ingestion is a complex and costly issue among patients in prison and those with psychiatric disorders. Risk factors for RIFB ingestion include male sex, incarceration, and the presence of a psychiatric disorder. Most patients can be managed with observation and endoscopy. Surgery is indicated in cases involving perforation or obstruction. The literature on preventative strategies for RIFB ingestion is scarce. Case Report: A 23-year-old man required 6 admissions in 1 calendar year for intentional foreign body ingestions. The patient was living in prison and had a history of bipolar I disorder, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. He underwent 9 endoscopic procedures that retrieved a total of 64 objects. The primary imaging modalities were abdominal X-ray and abdominopelvic contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan. The patient was managed with endoscopy and, in 2 cases, with observation alone. Serial abdominal examinations and abdominal films were used to monitor the progress of foreign bodies that were difficult to retrieve. A bowel regimen with polyethylene glycol facilitated the passage of the objects. The patient never required surgical intervention. The mean length of stay was 4.17 days. The recurrent ingestions may have been related to compulsions and family stress. Conclusions: Interdisciplinary collaboration is paramount in formulating effective treatment plans and limiting recurrence. Proposed strategies to prevent RIFB ingestion include the removal of ingestible objects from the environment, specialized prison units for close monitoring, early psychiatric intervention with appropriate pharmacologic/ behavioral therapy, and limiting hospital admissions to prevent secondary gain. Further studies are needed to determine the most effective approach to manage and prevent RIFB ingestion.",10.12659/ajcr.934164,Web of Science

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a low density area with enhancement in the mediastinum, especially around the esophageal wall. We planned to perform surgical drainage with the intention of performing intraoperative endoscopy from the beginning. We performed surgical drainage through a left cervical oblique incision; however, there was no exudate obtained from the mediastinal space. Despite the reported absence of accidental ingestion of a foreign substance, intraoperative endoscopy was performed that revealed a laceration in the esophageal mucosa 24 cm from the incisors. We diagnosed it as a submucosal abscess of the esophagus and prescribed parenteral antibiotics.

The purpose of our study was to determine the optimal protocol for radiographic survey post-coin ingestion. We hypothesized that for children presenting with a clear history of coin ingestion a frontal chest radiograph including the entire esophagus is adequate to guide treatment. Methods We reviewed the clinical history and radiographic surveys of 134 patients presenting with suspected or witnessed coin ingestion to the emergency department of a tertiary care pediatric hospital between January 2012 and June 2016. Patient demographics, presenting symptoms, anatomic coverage of survey, type, number and location of radiopaque foreign bodies, intervention, and follow-up were recorded. Results Coins were identified on radiographic surveys in 109 of 134 patients; 25 of 134 patients had no coin. Of those with coins, none of 109 had coin(s) in the airway, 42 of 109 had coin(s) in the esophagus, and 67 of 109 had coin(s) distal to the esophagus.

A PubMed and Google Scholar search discovered a variety of case reports detailing various methods and indications for endoscopic retrieval of right sided colonic foreign bodies. This case report endeavors to supplement the literature so that guidelines can one day be established for colonoscopic retrieval of right-sided foreign bodies. Case presentation: 36-year-old male prisoner swallowed 6.5 cm nail clippers with a long-standing history of intentional foreign body ingestion (FBI) including multiple lapamtomies for foreign body retrievals. Computerized tomography (CT) was used initially to confirm the position of the nail clippers. After almost two weeks of failure of the foreign body (FB) to move beyond the caecum as demonstrated on plain abdominal X-rays, the patient had a colonoscopy with successful retrieval of the FB. Clinical discussion: This case report hopes to encourage the consideration of colonoscopy for retrieval of right sided colonic foreign bodies that have failed to pass on their own and where an operation may come with increased risk (multiple laparotomies, multiple comorbidities, and higher anaesthetic risk for a general anaesthetic). Colonoscopy/endoscopy still has inherent risk and this patient did have an episode of temporary laryngospasm that required intubation and monitoring in the intensive care unit post operatively. Despite this the patient recovered and was discharged day one post procedure without further complication. The case report has been reported in line with the SCARE 2020 criteria (Agha et al., 2020 [2]). Conclusion: Indications for consideration of endoscopic retrieval of foreign bodies in the right colon have not been entirely detailed as endoscopy is for upper gastrointestinal foreign bodies.

CASE SUMMARY We presented two cases of patients complaining of retrosternal discomfort treated in our department for an aortoesophageal fistula caused by the accidental ingestion of a fishbone. The two patients were effectively managed with combined means of endoscopic, medical (broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, fasting, gastrointestinal decompression, etc.) and endovascular stent-graft treatment. The main difference in treatment was that the first patient presented with hematemesis after endoscopic removal of the fishbone. Subsequently, the patient underwent endovascular stent-graft treatment. The second case was managed with endoscopic removal of the fishbone with simultaneous endovascular stent-graft treatment, without any signs of hematemesis or melena. Both patients had successful postoperative management and were discharged home. Long-term follow-up is ongoing.

Design/method We performed a retrospective observational study of all patients presenting to a university hospital between January 2015 and April 2020 with iFoBI with a focus on objects swallowed, timing of endoscopy and clinical outcomes. Results 239 episodes of iFoBI in 51 individuals were recorded with a significant increase in incidence throughout the study period (Welch (5, 17.3)=15.1, p<0.001), imposing a high burden on staff and resources. Items lodged in the oesophagus were more likely to lead to mucosal injury (p=0.009) compared with elsewhere. Ingested item type and timing of endoscopy were not related to complications (p=0.78) or length of stay (p=0.8). In 12% of cases, no objects were seen at endoscopy. Conclusion In all except those patients with oesophageal impaction of the object on radiograph, there is no need to perform endoscopic extraction out of hours. A subset of cases can avoid endoscopy with an X-ray immediately prior to the procedure as a significant proportion have passed already. We discuss more holistic approaches to deal with recurrent attendances.",10.1136/flgastro-2021-101776,Web of Science

However, most dental treatment occurs outside of a hospital setting; thus the time to respond to a life-threatening situation is crucial. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and characteristics of medical emergencies that occurred at the Griffith University Dental Clinic over a 6-year period. Methods Data involving medical emergencies was collected at a dental school between January 2014 and December 2019. Data was obtained from the risk incident reporting system (GSafe), and descriptive statistics were analyzed using IBM SPSS. Results The frequency of medical emergencies in a dental setting over the 6-year retrospective period based on the number of dental services provided was 0.037% (n = 108). The three most common medical emergencies were syncope (25.0%), hypoglycemia (16.7%), and foreign body ingestion (13.9%). These happened more often during dental extractions (26.9%), followed by local anesthesia (16.7%) and restorative procedures (13.0%). A larger portion of these incidents occurred during dental treatment (62.0%) as opposed to before (12.0%) or after (26.0%). Most medical emergencies happened within the dental student clinic (72.2%) followed by the dental waiting room (19.5%) and dental private clinic (8.3%). Conclusion Overall, the number of medical emergencies at the Griffith University Dental Clinic was low. The most common medical emergencies were syncope, hypoglycemia, and foreign body ingestion. Dental education in preventative strategies and training in basic life support is necessary to ensure dental practitioners can manage the acute deterioration of a patient promptly.",10.1002/jdd.12859,Web of Science

Packets usually contain of opium, cocaine, cannabis and amphetamines. The significant complications of body packing usually are symptoms of drug toxicity due to leaking or ruptured packets or symptoms of ingesting relatively large foreign bodies. Herein, we present a case of heroin body-packing that resulted in subsequent bowel obstruction. Case presentation: A 30-year-old male, who was brought from the prison to the emergency department, complained of abdominal pain. After the absence of intoxication symptoms and insignificant plain abdominal radiograph results, abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the presence of ingested packets in the stomach as well as in the patient's small intestine. Therefore, the decision of surgery was immediately made for the patient, and during the surgery, the drug packets were entirely removed. The patient was discharged in good general condition three days after his surgery. Clinical discussion: Body packers are in considerable risk as rupture of packet inside the body and risk of obstruction that both of them may be fatal. Patients should be monitored for complications, possible early treatment, and removal or assistance in expulsion drug packets from the body. Initially on plain abdominal radiographs, classic findings suggest the presence of drug packets. Conclusion: In case of an inconclusive plain abdominal radiograph, further investigation with CT is indicated, with an almost 100 % sensitivity. For symptomatic patients, bowel obstruction and acute drug toxicity are the two most common indications for surgical intervention.",10.1016/j.ijscr.2023.108503,Web of Science
2023,"Huang, J.","Huang, JG; Tanpowpong, P",World Journal Of Gastroenterology,Paediatric gastrointestinal endoscopy in the asian-pacific region: recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques,"There has been a rapid expansion in the knowledge of paediatric gastroenterology over the recent decade, with a fast-growing repertoire of diagnostic techniques and management strategies for a wide spectrum of childhood gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. Paediatric GI endoscopy is a core competency every paediatric gastroenterologist should possess, and represents one of the most common procedures performed in children for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Yet there remains a dearth of literature on the utility and outcomes of paediatric GI endoscopy in the Asia-Pacific region. Data on the diagnostic value of paediatric GI endoscopy would be an important aspect of discussion, with the emergence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and eosinophilic GI disease as increasingly common endoscopic diagnoses. Time-based trends in paediatric GI endoscopy do point towards more IBD and gastroesophageal reflux disease-related complications being diagnosed, with a declining incidence of GI bleeding. However, the real-world diagnostic value of endoscopy in Asia must be contextualised to the region-specific prevalence of paediatric GI diseases. Helicobacter pylori infection, particularly that of multidrug-resistant strains, remains a highly prevalent problem in specific regions. Paediatric functional GI disorders still account for the majority of childhood GI complaints in most centres, hence the diagnostic yield of endoscopy should be critically evaluated in the absence of alarm symptoms. GI therapeutic endoscopy is also occasionally required for children with ingested foreign bodies, intestinal polyposis or oesophageal strictures requiring dilation. Endoscopic haemostasis is a potentially life-saving skill in cases of massive GI bleeding typically from varices or peptic ulcers. Advanced endoscopic techniques such as capsule endoscopy and balloon-assisted enteroscopy have found traction, particularly in East Asian centres, as invaluable diagnostic and therapeutic tools in the management of IBD, obscure GI bleeding and intestinal polyposis. State of the art endoscopic diagnostics and therapeutics, including the use of artificial intelligence-aided endoscopy algorithms, real-time confocal laser endomicroscopy and peroral endoscopic myotomy, are expected to gain more utility in paediatrics. As paediatric gastroenterology matures as a subspecialty in Asia, it is essential current paediatric endoscopists and future trainees adhere to minimum practice standards, and keep abreast of the evolving trends in the diagnostic and therapeutic value of endoscopy. This review discusses the available published literature on the utility of paediatric GI endoscopy in Asia Pacific, with the relevant clinical outcomes.",10.3748/wjg.v29.i18.2717,Web of Science

We implemented a Foreign Body Algorithm (FBA) designed to delay all but the most urgent endoscopy for EFI and FBI until regular working hours. Methods: Using endoscopy records from multiple academic and community hospitals within a large integrated health system in the United states, we identified esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) performed for food impactions and foreign body ingestions occurring between May 2011 and February 2021.Results: We identified 479 EGDs performed for FBI and EFI. The introduction of the FBA was associated with a shorter length of stay (LOS) for overall cases (0.35 vs. 0.8 d P < 0.001), day cases (0.16 vs. 1.0 d P < 0.001), and night cases (0.40 vs. 0.6 d P = 0.03). The introduction of the FBA did not change the rate of overall adverse events (AE) or night AE. AE from the entire cohort was rare (3%; 16 total). Of the AE, most were sedation related. The introduction of the FBA did not affect the overall rate of night cases or AE, but the rate of after-hours endoscopy for intentional ingestions decreased from 17.2% to 3.1% (P = 0.01).Conclusion: This is one of the largest studies of esophageal impactions and foreign bodies in adults in the United States, and the first to examine the effects of a protocol designed to avoid after-hours endoscopy.

X-ray and US images were obtained in various bowel-magnet orientations.ResultsWe identified several key US features to suggest bowel wall tethering. These include direct visualization of bowel wall entrapment between magnets (what we term the dangerous V sign), anti-dependent positions of the magnets, and inability to separate loops of bowel with compression.ConclusionThese findings could potentially provide valuable information when directing the urgency of intervention in foreign body ingestion.

Methods: The medical record was queried for all patients under 21 years old evaluated at our institution for button battery ingestion from 2008 to 2021. A severe outcome was defined as having at least one of the following: deep/circumferential mucosal erosion, perforation, mediastinitis, vascular or airway injury/fistula, or development of esophageal stricture. From a selection of clinically relevant factors, logistic regression determined predictors of a severe outcome, which were incorporated into a risk model. Results: 143 patients evaluated for button battery ingestion were analyzed. 24 (17%) had a severe outcome. The independent predictors of a severe outcome in multivariate analysis were location of battery in the esophagus on imaging (96%), battery size >/ 1/4 2 cm (95%), and presence of any symptoms on presentation (96%), with P < 0.001 in all cases. Predicted probability of a severe outcome ranged from 88% when all three risk factors were observed, to 0.3% when none were present. Conclusion: We report the presentation, management, and complication profiles of a large cohort of BB ingestions treated at a single institution.

In adults, foreign body ingestion is more common in patients with underlying psychiatric comorbidity, the elderly, alcohol intoxication, and in prisoners. This study reviewed the management of patients presenting to a tertiary hospital with foreign body ingestion.Patients and methods A retrospective review of patients presenting with foreign body ingestion to a tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Victoria, was undertaken from January 2017 to December 2021. Data collected included patient demographics, type of foreign body, length of stay, imaging modalities, management strategies, and complications. High-risk ingestion was defined as sharp objects, length >5 cm, diameter >2.5 cm, button battery and/or magnet ingestion or esophageal as per international guidelines.Results A total of 157 presentations by 63 patients with foreign body ingestion occurred between 2017 and 2021 (50% male; median age 30 years). Of the patients, 56% had underlying psychiatric comorbidities. The majority of presentations occurred in prisoners (65%). The most commonly ingested objects were batteries (23%), alleged drug-containing balloons (17%), razor blades (16%), and miscellaneous (40%). High-risk ingestion occurred in approximately two-thirds of presentations. Conservative management was the most common approach in 55% of patients. Complications, defined as perforation, bowel obstruction or fistula formation, did not occur in this cohort despite more than half presenting with high-risk ingestions. Thirty-day re-presentation rates were high (31%) and that was most common in patients with intentional ingestion, underlying mental health disorders, and a documented history of self-harm.Conclusions Conservative management for patients presenting with recurrent high-risk foreign body ingestion was safe in appropriately selected cases.

The patient underwent gastrostomy surgery, and 452 screws, nuts, keys, stones, and other metal parts weighing 2900 g were removed from the stomach. Five days after the operation, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric service in good general condition and was diagnosed with psychosis, and her condition returned to normal at follow-up.ConclusionSuccessful removal of this foreign body is rare. In chronic abdominal pain, especially in the context of psychiatric disorders, attention should be given to the ingestion of foreign bodies. In swallowing large amounts of sharp and metallic foreign objects, surgical intervention is necessary, especially in cases of obstruction, and saves the patient's life.",10.1186/s13256-024-04672-3,Web of Science

Patients were treated either conservatively (35 cases) or surgically (23 cases). The angle between the long axis of the foreign body and the intestinal canal (FB-IC angle) was measured. CT findings and clinical variables were evaluated to identify potential indicators for surgical treatment through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.ResultsUnivariate analysis revealed the FB-IC angle (P = 0.002), presence of free peritoneal gas (P = 0.002), white blood cell count (P = 0.018), and neutrophil count (P = 0.007) as significant factors associated with surgical treatment. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the FB-IC angle (odds ratio, 1.033; P = 0.045) and the presence of free peritoneal gas (odds ratio, 41.335; P = 0.002) are independent indicators for surgical management.

However, because expended lead shot ingested unintentionally by water-fowl and other avian species is fatal, the US Fish and Wildlife Service mandated exclusive use of steel shot for waterfowl hunting beginning in 1991. To discover the effects of implanted steel shot in a biological system, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed. Severe surface corrosion was evident when steel shot was placed in physiologic saline solution and sterile canine plasma. Eight laboratory dogs were surgically implanted with sterile steel shot in various superficial locations for intervals of 2 to 26 weeks. Corrosion of implants and tissue inflammation was observed in all biopsy specimens examined. It has been shown that steel shot embedded in tissues will corrode and result in a severe inflammatory response. If the accompanying inflammation is complicated by bacterial contamination, foreign body reactions resulting in infected, draining tracts could develop.

1996,"Leder, S.","Leder, SB",Head And Neck-Journal For The Sciences And Specialties Of The Head And Neck,Gag reflex and dysphagia,"Background. The gag reflex is a protective response that prevents foreign objects or noxious material from entering the pharynx, larynx, or trachea; it is not elicited during a normal swallow, Although no data have been reported to support a relationship between the gag reflex and dysphagia, the Sag reflex is nevertheless routinely assessed during the bedside dysphagia evaluation. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether absence of a gag reflex is a predictor of dysphagia. Method. Fourteen consecutive adult subjects referred for a bedside dysphagia evaluation because they were considered to be at increased risk for aspiration, specifically due to absence of a gag reflex, were investigated. In addition, the gag reflex was assessed in 69 normal adult volunteers. Results. Although all subjects were referred for bedside dysphagia evaluations specifically because they had no gag reflex, 86% (12/14) were nevertheless able to eat at least a puree diet, In addition, 86% (12/14) of subjects with no gag reflex had normal velar movement, reinforcing the physiologic differences between velar functioning during phonation and the gag reflex. The gag reflex, traditionally considered part of the bedside dysphagia evaluation, was absent in 13% (9/69) of nondysphagic subjects, raising further doubts regarding its clinical relevancy. Conclusion. The absence of a gag reflex does not appear to be a predictor of dysphagia.

With its branches squeezed to lie parallel, the cross is wrapped into a small strip of paper and ingested. After being released from its wrapper, the branches of the cross spring back to their original position and cause perforation of the bowel wall. Design: Case series. Setting: University hospital, Bulgaria. Patients: Five male prisoners from the same jail undergoing laparotomy for foreign body removal during 1 week in January 1994. Interventions: Laparotomy, removal of the foreign bodies through incisions of the bowel wall, immediate restoration of the gastrointestinal tract continuity, and peritoneal lavage and drainage. Outcome Measures: Morbidity and mortality. Results: Two of the patients were initially observed but subsequently underwent surgery for perforations of the gastrointestinal tract. Three of the patients underwent immediate operative treatment. There were 20 total crosses ingested; all foreign objects impacted and perforated the stomach (50%), first duodenal portion (25%), and fourth duodenal portion (20%). There was no morbidity or mortality among the five patients treated. Conclusions: Because ingested crosses that have been released from their wrappers never move distally, the only definitive solution is to operate early.",,Web of Science

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient (75 years old) was operated on  for cervical myelopathia due to cervical stenosis. Surgical treatment included an  anterior release with corporectomy of C4, C5 and C6 and iliac graft insertion,  and fixation using plate and screws. Immediate post-operative course was  uneventful. Plate incurvation and rupture were observed during the second  post-operative month, with partial anterior migration of the lower screw.

One hundred adult patients underwent a videofluoroscopic evaluation  of aspiration with either an esophagram (n = 31), upper gastrointestinal series  (n = 18), small bowel series (n = 23), or modified barium swallow procedure (n =  28), and concomitant evaluation of the gag reflex and velar movement on  phonation. All studies were performed using the lateral, upright position, and  all patients drank at least 5 cc of single contrast barium. Aspiration was  defined as penetration of material below the level of the true vocal folds. A  normal gag reflex and normal velar movement on phonation were observed in 14 of  15 (93%) patients who exhibited objective documentation of aspiration with  videofluoroscopy. Conversely, 19 of 20 (95%) patients without a gag reflex were  observed with videofluoroscopy to be without aspiration. Normal velar movement on  phonation was observed in 99 of 100 (99%) patients. There was no significant age  difference between patients with or without a gag reflex. No relationship was  found between the prevalence of aspiration and the gag reflex or velar movement  on phonation.

METHODS: A retrospective  review was done of the medical records of 112 infants and children who presented  with UGI bleeding. They underwent UGI endoscopy in the Taipei Veterans General  Hospital, Taiwan between July 1996 and December 2000. Patients with hematemesis  caused by swallowing caustic agents or foreign bodies were excluded. RESULTS:  There were 112 patients involved in this study. Clinical manifestations included  hematemesis (77 cases, 68.8%), tarry stool (37 cases, 33%) and hematochezia (9  cases, 8%). Fifty-three patients (47.3%) had underlying diseases, including  neuromuscular deficits (17), hepatobiliary disease (17), renal insufficiency (8),  Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) (3), and cow milk allergy (3). Another 34 patients  had a preceding acute febrile illness history. The endoscopic appearances  included esophageal varices (10.7%), esophagitis or esophageal ulcers (30.4%),  superficial gastric mucosal lesions (SGML) (44.6%), gastric ulcers (9.8%),  duodenal ulcers (DU) (15.2%), and hemorrhagic erosive duodenitis (2.7%).

Patients and Methods: As part of a larger study of the effects of retained lead bullets on blood lead, a retrospective review of study findings was completed on 5 of 8 patients who sustained injuries to the maxillofacial region. These 5 patients were recruited into the larger study within 11 days of injury and showed a penetration path for the projectile that engaged the upper aerodigestive tract. All subjects were recruited from patients presenting for care of their gunshot injuries to a large inner-city trauma center with a retained bullet resulting from a gunshot injury. An initial blood lead level was measured for all recruited patients and repeated 1 to 17 weeks later. Medical history was taken along with a screening and risk factor questionnaire to determine other potential or actual sources (occupational/recreational) of lead exposure. Cd-109 K-shell x-ray fluorescence determinations of bone lead were completed to determine past lead exposure not revealed by medical history and risk factor questionnaire. Radiographs taken of the abdomen and chest, required as a part of the patient's hospital care, were retrospectively reviewed for signs of metallic fragments along the aerodigestive tract. Results: All 5 patients retained multiple lead pellets or fragments at the site of injury, sustained fractures of the facial bones, and showed increases in blood lead. Three of the 5 study subjects who sustained maxillofacial gunshot injuries involving the mouth, nose, or throat region showed metallic densities along the gastrointestinal tract indicative of ingested bullet fragments. Each patient with ingested bullet fragments showed rapid elevation of blood lead exceeding 25 mug/dL and sustained increases well beyond the time when all ingested fragments were eliminated. A 3-year follow-up on these 3 patients showed significantly sustained elevation of blood lead but less than that observed during the initial 6 months after injury. None of the 5 study subjects showed any evidence of metallic foreign bodies within the tracheobronchial regions indicative of aspiration. Conclusion: Ingestion of lead fragments can result from gunshot injuries to the maxillofacial region and may substantially contribute to a rapid increase in blood lead level. Prompt diagnosis and elimination of ingested lead fragments are essential steps necessary to prevent lead being absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Increased blood lead in victims after gunshot injuries must be fully evaluated for all potential sources, including recent environmental exposure, absorption of lead from any remaining bullets in body tissues, and the possibility of mobilization of lead from long-term body stores such as bone.

METHODS: We  reviewed the medical records of children aged between 1 and 15 years old admitted  to Chang Gung Children's Hospital due to disc battery ingestion from September  1997 through July 2003). The diagnosis of disc battery ingestion was based upon  history, clinical symptoms, and results of imaging studies. The clinical data  reviewed included sex, age, clinical manifestation, hospital course, imaging  findings, and endoscopic results. RESULTS: We found 12 cases (8 males and 4  females) of disc battery ingestion with a mean age of 1.8 +/- 3.43 years (range,  9 months to 5 years). Two patients had symptoms of vomiting, nausea, and  abdominal pain. Two cases with no history of disc battery ingestion and were  accidentally found by X ray studies. Four cases had their batteries impacted in  the esophagus and eight cases had their batteries impacted in stomach. In those  patients with esophageal impaction, one died suddenly, and the batteries were  removed successfully by endoscope in the other three. Among those patients with  batteries in the stomach, two patients underwent endoscope removal and the other  6 patients experienced smooth courses and the batteries spontaneously passed  through the gastrointestinal tract within 5 days. The diameter of the ingested  disc batteries ranged from 12 mm to 23 mm. The duration of hospitalization varied  from 1 day to 61 days. Four patients had obvious damage of gastrointestinal  mucosa including three esophageal mucosal erosion lesions, and one gastric mucosa  erosion lesions with hemorrhage. Two patients experienced complications: one died  suddenly due to tension in the pneumothorax and penumoperitoneum and the other  had tracheoesophageal fistula. CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of disc battery ingestion  run uneventful courses. However, the ingestion of some disc batteries may be  fatal or complicated with life-threatening events. If the battery impacts in the  esophagus, emergency endoscopic management is necessary. Once in the stomach, the  battery will usually pass through the gastrointestinal tract without long-term  complications.",,PubMed

Children can ingest various foreign objects. One of such objects is safety pin, which is not widely reported in the literature. The purpose of this study is to consider the efficacy of Magill forceps for removal of safety pins from upper esophagus. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted for all children admitted to our hospital with safety pin ingestion from 1995 to 2003. In 58 children who had been found to ingest safety pin, the attachment site was gastrointestinal tract. In 12 of the cases, safety pins were located in the upper end of the esophagus. In seven of the children safety pin extraction was achieved by using A Magill forceps with the assistance of a laryngoscope maintaining general anesthesia with mask inhalation. Results: Safety pins were successfully removed with Magill forceps without any complications in seven patients whom they were located in the upper esophagus. Upper esophageal safety pins in the other five patients were extracted with rigid esophagoscopy for they were not seen under direct laryngoscopy. There were no complications. Conclusions: This is a preliminary report, but we believe that the Magill forceps technique for the removal of safety pin in the upper end of the esophagus is safe and minimally invasive method compared to rigid esophagoscopy.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A  prospective study was performed on 36 patients (26 F, 10 M, mean age 70 years)  with a history of foreign body impaction. All had negative findings at indirect  laryngoscopy. Radiologic assessment included unenhanced helical CT and a barium  contrast study. Patients with positive findings were taken to esophagoscopy. All  patients had a posterior clinical surveillance. RESULTS: Twenty patients had both  normal CT and barium study and satisfactory clinical outcome. In 12 patients a  foreign body was noted in the cervical esophagus by CT, barium study, and  endoscopy. In one patient a fish bone was detected by CT (and not by barium)  confirmed with esophagoscopy. Another patient had a fish bone esophageal  perforation which was observed only by CT and confirmed at surgery. Two patients  with normal barium and endoscopy presented a false-positive CT result.  CONCLUSION: Barium swallow is currently the first radiologic study, but may  involve a risk of aspiration and can impede a subsequent esophagoscopy.  Esophagoscopy is an invasive technique with a certain risk of serious  complications that can be avoided with a satisfactory radiologic assessment.

To assess the role CT in the evaluation of traumatic and spontaneous oesophageal perforation. Materials and methods. From March 2001 to May 2003, we studied 12 patients (7 males and 5 females; age range: 25-66 years, mean age: 43.5 years) with suspected oesophageal perforation due to motor-vehicle accidents (4 cases), stab wound (one case), post-intubation (2 cases),foreign body ingestion (2 cases) and spontaneous (3 cases). Five patients underwent standard chest and cervical radiography; two patients with suspected foreign body ingestion also underwent a gastrografin swallow study; all of the 12 patients underwent CT of the neck, chest and abdomen before and after intravenous, and in four cases oral, administration of contrast material. Results. In 5 patients with cervical, thoracic and abdominal trauma, the CT examination showed the presence of pleuroparenchymal injury (pneumothorax, pleural effusion and subcutaneous emphysema) as well as findings suggestive of oesophageal perforation: peri-oesophageal air (5 cases), peri-oesophageal fluid (4 cases), oesophageal wall thickening (3 cases), oesophageal wall laceration (2 cases) with abnormal course of the nasogastric tube in one of them and extraluminal extravasation of oral contrast material (2 cases). In 2 patients with post-intubation complications, CT showed the presence of a small peri-oesophageal fluid collection containing small gas bubbles in one case, and a gross perioesophageal abscess-like collection in the second case. In the 2 patients with foreign body ingestion, the plain radiography associated with CT showed the presence of a thin metal object in the cervical region (fragment of a dental plate) and a small extraluminal extravasation of gastrografin in one case, whereas in the other case CT showed the presence of a foreign body (chicken bone) in the hypopharynx with oesophageal wall thickening and peri-oesophageal oedema. In the remaining three patients with suspected spontaneous oesophageal perforation, CT showed the presence of a intramural haematoma in one case, oesophageal fluid distension with gas and a small peri-oesophageal fluid effusion (Mallory-Weiss syndrome) in another, and oesophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome) in the last case. Conclusions. Our experience shows that in patients with suspected traumatic and spontaneous oesopha-geal perforation, standard cervical and chest radiography may suggest a suspected oesophageal perforation in only a small proportion of cases, whereas oral contrast oesophagography has a higher sensitivity. Through the careful analysis of suggestive and specific signs of oesophageal perforation, a correct CT examination enables an accurate and timely diagnosis which significantly affects prognosis and provides valuable indications for treatment.",,Web of Science

Adolescent SIB commonly occurs during psychiatric inpatient hospitalization and in adolescents who are in group homes, residential treatment centers, and correctional facilities. There are reports of SIB in up to 61% of teen psychiatric inpatients (DiClemente, Ponton, and Hartley, 1991). Alongside self-cutting, self-burning, and other forms of SIB, an even more dangerous behavior has appeared that presents a major challenge in inpatient settings: deliberately swallowing indigestible objects. We first encountered this as a problem in an intermediate-term state hospital in 1992 when an older teen was transferred from an adult unit where she had been admitted on an emergency basis for repeated swallowing of batteries. The behavior is dangerous: endoscopy is sometimes needed to remove the foreign object, and other surgical procedures may be required. Such behavior has been classified as deliberate foreign body ingestion (DFBI). This report begins with a review of the literature on SIB and DFBI and discusses current thinking about the etiology of DFBI and related disorders. We then present our research, a systematic chart review describing 20 seriously ill youngsters who engaged in DFBI while hospitalized. Finally, we share our experience in working with this dangerous and maladaptive behavior. Our goal is to convey an understanding of these youth in the context of psychiatric practice, to enhance the treatment and prevention of DFBI and associated SIB.",,SCOPUS

This report  describes three selected cases and summarizes the 20 cases of magnet ingestion  identified by CPSC that occurred during 2003-2006. Caregivers should keep small  magnets away from young children and be aware of the unique risks (e.g., volvulus  and bowel perforation) that magnets pose if ingested.

Design and setting: Three hundred patients presenting with, a history of either aspirating or swallowing a foreign body were analyzed in a tertiary care, center. Data were collected by retrospective chart review and statistically analyzed. Results: Of the 300 patients studied, 90% (270 cases) did have a retained foreign body, with 233 (86.2%) cases found in the pharyngoesophagus and 37 (13.7%) cases in the tracheobronchial tree. With foreign bodies in the tracheobronchial passages, the most common sign and symptom were rhonchi (50%) and dyspnea (67%), respectively; in pharyngoesophagus, the most common symptom and sign were dysphagia (64%) and odynophagia (45%), respectively. The most common foreign body found was fish bone in 39% (106 cases) and the most common site of lodgment was the cervical esophagus 50.5% (136 cases). Rigid endoscopy with forceps removal under general anesthesia was the main treatment modality. Thirty-three (12.2%) cases had complications secondary to retained foreign body. Conclusion: Foreign bodies in the aerodigestive tract continue to be a common problem affecting adults and children alike. Rigid endoscopies with forceps removal under general anesthesia are the preferred management modality. From their experience, the authors recommend that no foreign body in the upper aerodigestive tract should be left alone with the hope that it will come out spontaneously.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen expandable covered metallic stents were placed with fluoroscopic guidance in 16 patients (14 men, two women; mean age, 60 years; age range, 26-75 years) with malignant and benign strictures of the cervical esophagus. The causes of strictures were ingestion of corrosive agents (n = 3), biopsy-proved squamous cell carcinoma (n = 12), and postsurgical scarring (n = 1). The mean dysphagia scores at presentation were compared with those after stent placement by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: Stent placement was technically successful in all patients. The reduction in the mean dysphagia score after stent placement was statistically significant (P = .0327). All patients complained of mild to severe foreign body sensation, with four reporting severe pain necessitating immediate stent removal. With the exception of one patient with limited follow-up, complications requiring intervention occurred in all patients, including migration in nine patients and tissue hyperproliferation in two. Of the 12 patients with a malignant stricture of the esophagus, four patients eventually underwent gastrostomy for the placement of a feeding tube and one patient underwent surgery.

When swallowed, open safety pins are mostly found within the esophagus or stomach, and they cannot be easily removed by rigid esophagogastroscopy. Our aim was to evaluate the removal of safety pins using flexible endoscopy in infants. Materials and Methods: We evaluated the cases of 7 infants who had ingested open safety pins between 2001 and 2004. In all the patients, the primary diagnostic tool was a direct x-ray of the neck, chest, and abdomen. In all cases, the safety pins were removed by flexible esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Clinical records for the cases were reviewed. Results: Four of the open safety pins were lodged in the esophagus, two in the stomach, and one in the duodenum. One infant had a safety pin lodged in the esophagus with the pin's open end pointed caudally; the pin was held with the endoscopic forceps by its tail end and removed. Three safety pins in the esophagus had their open ends pointing cephalad; these were held by their tail ends using the endoscopic forceps and pushed into the stomach. Then they were rotated in the stomach and removed tail end first. The safety pins located in the stomach or duodenum were also removed similarly. All safety pins were successfully removed, and there were no operative complications. Conclusion: Open surgery or other invasive removal methods are not necessary in infants with open safety pin ingestions. In our opinion, the best way to extract an open safety pin from the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum is by using a flexible endoscopic device.",10.1089/lap.2006.0060,Web of Science

Most commonly, FB are introduced through the anal passage or reach the rectum after oral ingestion. We describe our experience in the diagnosis and treatment of FB retained in the rectum. Method From 1997 to 2004, data were collected prospectively in 30 patients (20 men and 10 women; median age 42.5 years). Extraction method, size and type of object, and postextraction evolution were reviewed. Results The FB was introduced anally in 16 cases and by oral ingestion in 14. Principal associated factors were: mental disorder in 11, penitentiary confinement in two, and drug and alcohol intake in two. Recent sexual activity had taken place in 14 cases. The size and nature of the FB were varied. The most frequent symptom was constipation with or without pelvic or anal discomfort (n = 23, 77%). Treatment consisted of spontaneous ejection (n = 2), digital extraction with or without enemas (n = 10), digital extraction under local/regional anaesthesia after fragmentation (n = 11) and regional exploratory laparotomy under general anaesthesia (n = 7). Grade I rectal trauma was the most common (n = 23, 77%). Six patients required colostomy. Four patients (13.5%) suffered complications and none died. Only 17 patients were hospitalized, with a mean stay of 6 days. All patients recovered without sequelae. Conclusion The diagnosis of rectal FB should be suspected when faced with low pelvic or perianal abdominal pain and/or rectal haemorrhage within the context of an unconvincing story in patients without a history of recent instrumental rectal exploration for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. Because of potential complications, FB in the rectum should be considered a serious condition that must be treated without delay.",10.1111/j.1463-1318.2006.01184.x,Web of Science

This review discusses the anaesthetic potential risks and complications observed with tattooing and piercing, their management and prevention. Recent findings Airway management during anaesthesia is of particular interest with oral jewellery. Patients often refuse to remove their piercing for fear of tract closure. There are no serious complications reported after epidural puncture through a tattoo, although any long-term consequence cannot be discarded yet. Even theoretical concerns are more and more debated. Summary Oral and nasal piercing is of particular concern because of the risks of swallowing and aspiration. Consequently, patients should be advised to remove piercing before anaesthesia. Emergency situations are especially risky and anaesthesiologists should be aware of the piercing removal techniques. In case of piercing loss, radiographies and fiberoptic endoscopy of the upper airways and digestive tracts should be performed to eliminate aspiration or swallowing of the foreign body. Epidurals should not be denied to parturients with lumbar tattooing.

2009,"Schrom, T.","Schrom, T; Amm, S",Laryngo-Rhino-Otologie,Unusual case of oesophageal foreign body as part of a self-harm syndrome,"Introduction: Foreign bodies in the oesophagus represent a frequent emergency situation in ENT medicine. Usually the cases involve lumps of meat, bones, shards of glass, bottle tops, batteries or dentures. We would like to report about an unusual foreign body found in the oesophagus. Patient: A 45-year-old patient presented himself in our interdisciplinary casualty department where he claimed to have swallowed a butter-knife that morning as a bet. The ENT examination showed no abnormal findings. The thorax X-Ray revealed a 14 cm-long foreign body in projection to the oesophagus, which matched the knife. Following consultation with the thorax surgeon, a rigid oesophagoscopy was conducted under endotracheal intubation and the knife was easily removed using tongs. Archive searches conducted in the meantime showed that foreign bodies had been removed from the patient on numerous occasions by fellow surgeons either laparoscopically or via open surgery. As a result, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric ward with unimpeded swallowing reflex with a suspected self-harming syndrome.

Usually the cases involve lumps of meat, bones, shards of glass, bottle tops, batteries or dentures. We would like to report about an unusual foreign body found in the oesophagus. Patient: A 45-year-old patient presented himself in our interdisciplinary casualty department where he claimed to have swallowed a butter-knife that morning as a bet. The ENT examination showed no abnormal findings. The thorax X-Ray revealed a 14 cm-long foreign body in projection to the oesophagus, which matched the knife. Following consultation with the thorax surgeon, a rigid oesophagoscopy was conducted under endotracheal intubation and the knife was easily removed using tongs. Archive searches conducted in the meantime showed that foreign bodies had been removed from the patient on numerous occasions by fellow surgeons either laparoscopically or via open surgery. As a result, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric ward with unimpeded swallowing reflex with a suspected self-harming syndrome.

Current literature lacks good data documenting long-term outcomes in children. This makes it difficult to counsel some patients about realistic treatment expectations. The objective of this study is to evaluate our institutional experience and define the natural history and treatment outcomes. Methods: A retrospective review of clinical data obtained from children who underwent dilation for PS was performed. Results: Over the past 30 years, 114 children and adolescents received 486 dilations. The most common indications for stricture dilation were PS (42%) and esophageal atresia (38%). Other lesser indications included congenital, foreign body, corrosive, cancer, radiation, allergic, and infectious. This review focuses on the 48 children with PS. Of the children with PS, a congenital anomaly was identified in 23 children; and 12 had neurologic impairment. Average age at presentation was 10.2 years (range, 0.5-18.3 years). Most patients had had symptoms for many months before diagnosis. Peptic stricture was most common in the lower esophagus (n = 39). However, middle (n = 8) and upper (n = 1) strictures were occasionally identified. Noncompliance with medical therapy was a challenge in 12% (n = 5) of children. Children with a PS received a median of 3 dilations, but a subset of 5 patients with severe strictures underwent up to 48 dilations (range, 1-48). Repeated dilations were required for a median of 20 months (range, 1-242 months). Among patients receiving esophageal dilation for PS, 94% required an antireflux procedure (19% required a second antireflux surgery). A subgroup of patients (n = 10) was identified who required extended dilations, multiple surgeries, and esophageal resection. This subgroup had a significantly longer period of symptomatic disease and increased risk of esophageal resection compared with those patients requiring fewer dilations. Surgical resection of the esophageal stricture was ultimately required in 3 children with PS after failure of more conservative measures. Conclusion: Children and adolescents presenting with reflux esophageal stricture (PS) frequently require antireflux surgery, redo antireflux surgery, and multiple dilations for recurrent symptoms. We hope that these data will be of use to the clinician attempting to counsel patients and parents about treatment expectations in this challenging patient population. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Most foreign objects are incidentally detected at CT, but they may mimic a wide range of pathologic conditions. Some foreign objects (eg, an object that has been swallowed either intentionally or unintentionally) are the cause of the patient's signs and symptoms and require prompt medical attention. Other objects, such as a sponge or surgical instrument that has been retained postoperatively, may have medicolegal consequences. Furthermore, certain objects, such as intentionally concealed drug packets, may go undetected unless a high degree of suspicion exists and appropriate window settings are used to review the study. The radiologist should be familiar with the wide range of foreign objects that may be encountered at abdominopelvic CT, be able to recognize them promptly, and understand their implications for patient treatment.

Methods: Data were prospectively collected on patients presenting to the emergency department for treatment of injuries from 2008 to 2010 (n = 23,625). The subset of pediatric patients (n = 7233) underwent cross-sectional analysis to examine demographics, injury environment, timing and mechanisms. Results: Pediatric patients, (0-16 years) comprised 30.6% of all trauma patients. Mean age was 7.2 years. Falls were the most common injury (43%), followed by burns (11.1%), pedestrian road traffic injuries (9.7%), foreign bodies (7.5%), and assaults (7.2%). Statistically significant differences in injury pattern were observed between gender, age groups and season. After logistic regression, predictors of fall included male gender, home setting, and rainy season, whereas predictors of burn included female gender, age 0-5 yrs, home setting, and cold season. Predictors of pedestrian injury included age 6-10 yrs, female, and roadside setting. Predictors of foreign body ingestion included age 0-5 yrs, female gender, home setting, and daytime, and predictors of assault include male gender, age 11-16 yrs, nighttime hours.

Fully revised to incorporate the latest research and clinical strategies, the second edition uses a stepped-care framework to match interventions to client needs. It features new chapters on the relationship between suicide and self-injury; formal assessment; family therapy; residential treatment for adolescents; and severe types of self-injury. Walsh is joined by several colleagues who have contributed chapters in their respective areas of expertise. Part I offers a practical introduction to self-injury: what specific behaviors clinicians are likely to encounter, which populations are most at risk and why, and connections to suicidality. Part II, the core of the volume, addresses assessment and treatment. Chapters on a wide range of cognitive-behavioral interventions include vivid case examples that illuminate the thoughts and feelings of self-injurers and show what the therapeutic strategies look like in action. Clinicians get essential guidance for tailoring interventions for clients with different symptom presentations, levels of impairment, and co-occurring problems. Part III covers special topics, including managing self-injury in school settings and correctional facilities. Chapters also present vital information on dangerous behaviors such as the 'choking game,' foreign body ingestion, and major self-injury.

This study was undertaken in order to better define clinical patterns of IIFO among prisoners. We sought to determine factors associated with the need for endoscopic and surgical therapy for IIFO. Methods: After obtaining permission to conduct IIFO research in incarcerated populations, study patients were identified by ICD-9 codes. Patient charts were reviewed for demographics; past medical history; IIFO characteristics; and diagnostic, endoscopic, and surgical findings. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using statistical software. Results: Thirty patients with 141 episodes of IIFO were identified. The mean number of ingested items per episode was 4.60. Endoscopy was performed in 97 of 141 IIFO instances, with failure to retrieve the ingested object in 21 of 97 cases (22%). Eleven instances (7.8%) required surgical intervention. On multivariate analyses, hospital admission was associated with elevated white blood cell count (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, P < 0.05) and number of items ingested (OR 1.3, P < 0.05). The need for endoscopy was independently associated with ingestion of multiple objects (OR 3.3, P < 0.05) and elevated white blood cell count (OR 1.3, P < 0.05). Surgical therapy was significantly associated with elevated white blood cell count (OR 1.6, P < 0.01) and with increasing number of ingested items (OR 1.07 per item, P < 0.05). Endoscopy is associated with significantly lower odds of surgery (OR 0.13, P < 0.01). Conclusions: Intentional ingestion of foreign objects continues to pose a significant human and economic burden. The need for admission or therapy is frequently associated with leukocytosis. Further investigation is warranted into resource-appropriate triage of patients who present with IIFO.

Body packing is used for the smuggling of drugs such as  heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, hashish and ecstasy. Most body packers are  asymptomatic. However, packets may rupture or obstruct the alimentary tract.  Preventive surgery has been recommended for body packers with package retention  beyond 5-7 days to prevent the serious consequences of leakage and rupture. The  purpose of the present study was to evaluate a conservative protocolled approach  to body packers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively registered all patients  suspected of body packing who were brought to a department of surgical  gastroenterology. The study comprised a two-year study period from 1 March 2011  to 28 February 2013. RESULTS: A total of 57 patients suspected of body packing  were detained and admitted to a hospital. In 29 (53%) of the patients, body  packing was confirmed by CT. All 29 body packers were successfully treated  conservatively without surgical or endoscopical intervention. The median number  of packages ingested was 55 (range 2-120). The body packers were all foreigners  and originated from either Eastern Europe or West Africa. In one patient, body  packages were retained for 17 days. None of the body packers underwent emergency  operation or had signs of rupture. CONCLUSION: Body packers can be treated  conservatively unless there is clinical suspicion of acute obstruction,  perforation or intoxication. Package retention per se is not an indication for  emergency operation. FUNDING: not relevant. TRIAL REGISTRATION: not relevant.",,PubMed

The purpose of this study was to validate the usefulness of MDCT for diagnosis of a sharp or pointed esophageal foreign body according to esophageal level. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Forty-two patients with a history of sharp or pointed foreign body ingestion were reviewed retrospectively. Two observers interpreted the CT and the conventional radiography datasets separately. If a foreign body was directly identified, it was regarded as a positive finding. Even if no high-density foreign body was found, detection of a secondary finding was considered to be a positive finding. Diagnostic performance of MDCT and conventional radiography were compared according to esophageal level. Final diagnosis was made by esophagoscopy or surgery in addition to the clinicoradiologic result. RESULTS. MDCT was statistically superior to conventional radiography for diagnosis of a thoracic esophageal foreign body for both observers (p < 0.001 for each). No significant difference in sensitivity between CT and conventional radiography for diagnosis of cervical esophageal foreign body was noted regardless of observer. Both observers could identify all complicated conditions with MDCT regardless of esophageal level. However, in two of three cases of complicated thoracic esophageal foreign bodies, neither observer could detect foreign bodies on conventional radiography; furthermore, the observers could not identify pneumomediastinum.

Most cases  were managed conservatively (87.6%). Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal  tract was performed in 37 cases with a success rate of 46 per cent. In 9.3 per  cent of cases, the final treatment was endoscopic. Only five patients required  surgical treatment, being emergent just in one case. We advocate conservative  treatment for asymptomatic patients with foreign body ingestion. Endoscopic  removal is proposed for pointed objects or objects bigger than 2.5 cm located in  the stomach. Objects longer than 6 to 8 cm located in the stomach should be  removed by endoscopy or laparoscopy. Patients with objects in the small bowel or  colon should be treated conservatively unless there are complications or they  fail to progress.",,PubMed

The immediate risk to the patient ranges from negligible to life threatening. Initial and follow-up management strategies depend on multiple patient and ingested object-related factors. Available literature on this topic tends to focus on the small child or adult, leaving the clinician caring for adolescents to extrapolate this information to guide decision making for individual patients. This article reviews foreign body ingestion literature with important implications to the adolescent patient and raises awareness of some highly dangerous objects such as large button batteries, high-powered magnets, long sharps, narcotic packages, and super absorbent objects. An additional focus includes the management of esophageal food impaction. We highlight the unique aspects to the care of the adolescent with intentional ingestion and co-morbid psychiatric illness.

Study Design and Setting Cross-sectional analysis of national databases; literature review. Subjects and Methods The Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) was used to derive a national weighted estimate of emergency department visits for wire bristle injury from 2002 to 2014. Date, location of injury, demographics, and outcomes were analyzed. A literature search and a consumer-reported injury database (SaferProducts.gov) were interrogated to provide ancillary sources of data. Results A total of 43 cases were found within the NEISS database, which extrapolated to an estimated 1698 (95% confidence interval, 1468-1927) emergency department visits nationwide. In the NEISS database, the mean age was 30 years, and the sex distribution of the patients was similar (21 males vs 22 females). The most common location of injury was the oropharynx in both the NEISS database (23 of 43, 53.4%) and the literature review (11 of 36, 30.5%). However, the oral cavity was the most frequent site in the consumer-reported SaferProducts.gov database (9 of 24, 37.5%). The majority of patients in the NEISS were treated in the emergency department (31 of 43, 69.7%). Raw case counts were highest in June, July, and August, with the highest number of events in the month of July.

This study was to identify factors related to outcomes of FB ingestion, particularly BBs in the stomach. We evaluated whether the current recommendations are appropriate and aimed to suggest indications for endoscopic removal of BB in the stomach in young children. Methods: We investigated patient age, shape, size, location of FBs, spontaneous passage time and resulting complications among 76 children. We observed types, size, location of BB and outcomes, and analyzed their associations with complications. Results: Coins and BB were the two most common FBs. Their shapes and sizes were not associated with the spontaneous passage time. Size, spontaneous passage time, and age were also not associated with any specific complications. For BB ingestion, all 5 cases with lithium batteries (>= 1.5 cm, 3 V) presented moderate to major complications in the esophagus and stomach without any symptoms, even when the batteries were in the stomach and beyond the duodenum, while no complications were noted in 7 cases with alkaline batteries (<1.5 cm, 1.5 V) (p=0.001). All endoscopies were conducted within 24 hours after ingestion. Conclusion: The type and voltage of the battery should be considered when determining whether endoscopy is required to remove a BB in the stomach. For lithium battery ingestion in young children, urgent endoscopic removal might be important in order to prevent complications, even if the child is asymptomatic and the battery is smaller than 2 cm.",10.5223/pghn.2016.19.1.20,Web of Science

Therefore, this study compares the advantages and disadvantages of both endoscopic procedures from a clinical perspective. Methods: A retrospective review was made of 273 patients suspected of esophageal FBs in emergency consultations of a tertiary medical referral center from March 2010 to March 2014. All patients received routine physical examinations, otolaryngological examinations, and X-rays of the neck and chest. The door-to-endoscopy time, procedure time, postendoscopic hospital stay, successful removal rates, and complications were analyzed as well. Results: In this study, the most common esophageal FBs were fish and animal bones (76%) in adults and coins (74%) in children. The patients with existing esophageal FBs had significantly more frequent symptoms of dysphagia and signs of linear opacity as detected with lateral neck radiography than those without FB. Additionally, the door-to-endoscopy time, procedure time, and postendoscopic hospital stay was significantly shorter in FE patients than in RE patients. However, both RE and FE patients had high rates of successful FB removal (95%) and low complication rates (2%). Conclusion: Both FE and RE remove esophageal FBs successfully, as evidenced by their high success rates, low complication rates, and high detection rates. Although FE under local anesthesia is a less time-consuming procedure for adults, RE under general anesthesia may be preferable for children and can serve as an alternative to FE.

Unintentional foreign body ingestion commonly occurs accidentally in children aged between 3 months and 6 years and at advanced ages or results  from psychiatric disorders such as hallucination in patients with mental  retardation. Most of the ingested foreign bodies are naturally discharged from  the body but some of them may require surgical intervention. Presentation of  Case. A 29-year-old mentally retarded female patient was admitted to the  emergency service with a two-day history of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness, defense, and rebound on  palpation. Radiological examination revealed diffuse air-fluid levels and a  radiopaque impression of a metal object in the right upper quadrant. The metal  teaspoon causing ileal perforation was extracted by emergency laparotomy. On  postoperative day 7, the patient was uneventfully discharged following a  psychiatric consultation. Discussion. Foreign body ingestion can occur  intentionally in children at developing ages and old-age patients, or adults and  prisoners, whereas it may occur unintentionally in patients with mental  retardation due to hallucination. However, repeated foreign body ingestion is  very rare in individuals other than mentally retarded patients. Conclusion.

Pediatric emergency physicians and gastroenterologists often encounter nervous and distressed situations, because of children presenting with this condition in the common clinical practice. When determining the appropriate timing and indications for intervention, physicians should consider multiple patient-and FB-related factors. The utilization of a flexible endoscopy is considered safe and effective to use in these cases, with a high success rate, for the effective extraction of FBs from the gastrointestinal tract of a child. Additionally, a Foley catheter and a magnet-attached Levin tube have been used for decades in the case of FB removal. Although their use has decreased significantly in recent times, these instruments continue to be used for several indications. Using a Foley catheter for this purpose does not require special training and does not necessarily require sedation of the patient or fluoroscopy, which serve as advantages of utilizing this method for foreign object retrieval. An ingested magnet or iron-containing FB can be retrieved using a magnet-attached tube, and can be effective to retrieve an object from any section of the upper gastrointestinal tract that can be reached. Simple and inexpensive devices such as Foley catheters and magnet-attached tubes can be used in emergencies such as with the esophageal impaction of disk batteries if endoscopy cannot be performed immediately (e.g., in rural areas and/or in patients presenting at midnight in a facility, especially in those without access to endoscopes or emergency services, or in any situation that warrants urgent removal of a foreign object).",10.5223/pghn.2019.22.2.132,Web of Science

The aim of this study was to present some practical suggestions for ingested safety pins using an accompanying algorithm, presented for the first time in the literature to the best of our knowledge. Methods: Twenty children with ingested safety pins during a 4-year period were retrospectively included in the study. Results: Median age of patients was 9.5 months (interquartile range, 6.3-14 months), and 70% were girls. On endoscopic examination, safety pins were observed in the stomach (25%), duodenal bulb (20%), upper esophagus (15%), middle esophagus (10%), and second part of the duodenum (10%) but were not observed in 20% of the cases. Safety pins were removed using endoscopy in 15 cases (75%). In four cases (20%), no safety pin was observed on endoscopic examination. In one case (5%) involving a 6-month-old infant, the safety pin could not be removed although it was observed using endoscopy. No surgical intervention was needed for any patient. No complications such as perforation or deaths developed, except for erosions, due to the foreign body removal procedure. Conclusion: Safety pins are easily removed endoscopically. The best option is to remove the safety pin using endoscopy while it is still in the esophagus and stomach. For this reason, endoscopic procedures should be performed as soon as possible in children who have ingested safety pins.",10.5223/pghn.2019.22.5.441,Web of Science

In adults, foreign body ingestion can be accidental, related to specific pathological changes of the digestive tract, or deliberate, as observed in patients with psychiatric diseases or in those released from the prison. Case presentation: A 42-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with symptoms including choking, drooling from the mouth, holding his neck, and aphonia. He had a history of psychiatric illness with suicidal ingestion of a foreign body. After stabilization, he was sent for chest radiograph, which revealed a significant radiopaque shadow the shape of a spanner, occupying the whole length of the esophagus. Emergency rigid esophagoscopy was performed to save the patient's life. Discussion: The patient swallowed the largest hard foreign body to harm himself or his family, to get the attention of his family, or as a suicide attempt. Such patients require urgent intervention by rigid esophagoscopy to reduce the risk of complications and to save the patients' lives. Further follow-up is essential due to the possibility of repeated foreign body ingestion. Conclusion: While taking care of psychiatric patients, close observation by family members is mandatory to prevent them from harming themselves and to prevent suicide attempts by swallowing sharp, hard, large, and dangerous foreign bodies such as the size 17 wrench spanner observed in the present case.",10.1016/j.amsu.2020.04.039,Web of Science

This is particularly true when they lead to self-injurious  behavior that can only be prevented by either limiting the freedom of the  adolescent or forcing treatments on them that they do not want. Intentional and  repeated foreign-body ingestion (FBI) in youth is a poorly understood  self-injurious behavior that can be life-threatening. It poses unique clinical  and ethical challenges. Ingestion of sharp or magnetic objects increases the need  for endoscopic retrieval or surgical intervention with associated risks,  including perforation and anesthesia-related adverse events.

Injury remains a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in the developing world. The probability of injury occurrence is influenced by agent, host and environmental factors. Studies of repeat injuries in childhood therefore provide insight into factors in the epidemiological triad predisposing children to injury. Objectives. To determine the proportion of children and the factors associated with repeat presentations to the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital Trauma Unit (RCWMCH TU) in Cape Town, South Africa, for all non-transport-related injuries in childhood. Methods. This was a retrospective cohort study using data from the RCWMCH TU. We included children aged 0 - 10 years with first presentation from January 1997 to June 2013 and followed up until the earlier of age 13 years or June 2016. We assessed individual and population-level factors associated with repeat injury using multilevel Poisson regression analysis. Child dependency ratios were derived from the 2011 National Census. Results. Between 1997 and 2013, 72 490 children aged <10 years (59% male) presented to the RCWMCH TU for the first time with injuries. After the initial injury, 9 417 (13%) presented with a repeat injury by 2016 and before age 13 years. After adjusting for health subdistrict, distance from RCWMCH TU and age at first presentation, factors associated with reduced repeat presentation were injury identified as due to abuse (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 0.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4 - 0.7), fluid burn (aIRR 0.6; 95% CI 0.6 - 0.7), foreign body ingestion (aIRR 0.7; 95% CI 0.7 - 0.9), and moderate and severe (v. minor) initial injury (aIRR 0.9; 95% CI 0.8 - 0.9 and aIRR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6 - 0.8, respectively), while boys were more likely to have repeat injury presentations (aIRR 1.4; 95% CI 1.4 - 1.5). Conclusions. Repeat presentations were substantial and associated with male gender. They occurred less commonly after fluid burn injuries, foreign body ingestion and moderate to severe injuries. Children with intentional injuries were also less likely to have a repeat presentation. Further research is indicated for childhood injuries with greater propensity to repeat, including non-height falls and sport-related injuries. Secondary injury prevention education should not neglect patients with unintentional and minor injuries.

In this work, a case of perforation of the sigmoid colon is described, caused by a toothpick ingestion. The patient had to be surgically treated because of a complication: the formation of an entero-iliac fistula with subsequent development of a pseudoaneurysm of the right external iliac artery. Vascular perforation due to toothpick ingestion has rarely been reported.

Delay in their diagnosis and treatment may significantly increase morbidity and mortality. Causes of esophageal injury include iatrogenic (including esophagogastroduodenoscopy and stent placement), foreign body ingestion, blunt or penetrating trauma to the chest or abdomen, and forceful retching, also called Boerhaave syndrome. Although fluoroscopic esophagography remains the imaging study of choice according the American College of Radiology appropriateness criteria, CT esophagography has been shown to be at least equal to if not superior to fluoroscopic evaluation for esophageal injury. In addition, CT esophagography allows diagnosis of extra-esophageal abnormalities, both as the cause of the patient's symptoms as well as incidental findings. CT esophagography also allows rapid diagnosis since the examination can be readily performed in most clinical settings and requires no direct radiologist supervision, requiring only properly trained technologists and a CT scanner. Multiple prior studies have shown the limited utility of fluoroscopic esophagography after a negative chest CT scan and the increase in accuracy after adding oral contrast agent to CT examinations, although there is considerable variability of CT esophagography protocols among institutions. Development of a CT esophagography program, utilizing a well-defined protocol with input from staff from the radiology, gastroenterology, emergency, and general surgery departments, can facilitate more rapid diagnosis and patient care, especially in overnight and emergency settings. The purpose of this article is to familiarize radiologists with CT esophagography techniques and imaging findings of emergent esophageal conditions.

Methods A retrospective analysis of data of all the patients who underwent endoscopic management for foreign body removal by a single surgeon in a tertiary care hospital in southern India between 2015 and 2020 was conducted. Patient variables in terms of age, sex, type of foreign body, its location in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the time between ingestion and presentation, the time between presentation and endoscopy, treatment outcomes were reviewed. Results A total of 97 patients were studied. The age range of the patients studied was one month to 71 years. Males were predominant (n=64, 65.97%). The most common retrieved foreign body were coins (n=31, 31.9%). The most common site of foreign body lodgment was the esophagus (n=75, 77.31%), with the upper third esophagus (n=38; 39.37%) being the predominant site. The success rate of endoscopic retrieval in our study was 97%. No procedure-related complications were encountered in any patient.

In adults, intentional foreign body ingestion is frequently observed among individuals with psychiatric disorders and prisoners. Controversies exist regarding the management of sharp or pointed objects. We contribute to this existing controversy by presenting a case of a 43-year-old male who accidently ingested a metallic screw and was managed successfully through endoscopic retrieval.Case presentation: We discuss a case of a 43-year-old male presented to our emergency department after accidently swallowing a metallic screw, 1 h and a half prior to his presentation. He was initially asymptomatic then started to complain of vague abdominal symptoms. X-rays of the chest and abdomen demonstrated the presence of a metallic screw at the mid-abdomen. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen then confirmed its presence within the gastric lumen, with no evidence of gastric or bowel perforation. The patient was managed via esophagogastroduodenoscopy in which the ingested screw was extracted. He was discharged after 24 hours in a good condition. Clinical discussion: A limited number of epidemiological studies have shed light on the prevalence and incidence of foreign body ingestion among adult individuals. Probability of spontaneous passage depends on several factors including the size, shape and composition of the impacted item, as well as the age of patient and duration of ingestion prior to presentation.Conclusion: Considering the variation of ingested objects and the availability of several therapeutic approaches, a patient-tailored management plan should always be established.",10.1016/j.amsu.2022.104944,Web of Science

Mostly FBs are found ingested accidently or intentionally in children and adults with mental status alterations. Depending on the type of object, different complications can occur. There exist numerous methods for removing each specific FB. Fortunately, most FBs tend to move uneventfully through the gastrointestinal tract without any intervention; but managing some foreign objects can be difficult and lead to severe complications. Endoscopy helps with the diagnosis and treatment of these cases, but the time of the management plays an important role. Case presentation: A 26-year-old female who intentionally swallowed two sewing needles, presented to our emergency department with abdominal pain two months after the FB ingestion. One of the sewing needles was spontaneously excreted through the bowel, and the other was present in her body for two months. The FB had penetrated the stomach and migrated to the peritoneal cavity. The patient's condition was managed by laparoscopic removal of the FB and repair of the damaged tissue. According to the traumatic nature of the needle to abdominal viscera, and standing outside the GI tract on the pancreas surface, laparoscopic removal of the foreign metallic body was chosen to be performed. No complication was seen during the postoperative period. Conclusion: This report emphasizes the importance of prompt evaluation of FB patients and finding the appropriate method of managing its complications.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor has become one of the most common causes of EDKA. We present one of the lowest presenting blood glucose levels for the EDKA in the setting of SGLT2 inhibitor use. A 34-year-old female with a two-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) presented after accidental ingestion of a metal clip and lack of oral intake for 28 hours. She reported a recent intentional weight loss of 60 lbs. She takes metformin 1000 mg twice daily and empagliflozin 25 mg daily. An urgent endoscopy was planned in the intensive care unit given the proximal location of the foreign body. The basic metabolic profile after the procedure demonstrated a glucose level of 75 mg/dL, bicarbonate level of 11 mmol/L, and AG of 17 mmol/L. The venous pH was 7.27 with a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 30 mmHg. The urinalysis showed a glucose level greater than 500 mu mol/L with a ketone level of 80 mu mol/L. The blood and urine toxicology screening results were unremarkable. The patient was treated for EDKA with the administration of intravenous (IV) dextrose 5% in water with subsequent initiation of IV insulin. The assessment of her insulin reserve revealed a low C-peptide of 0.36 ng/mL, a high glutamic acid decarboxylase level greater than 250 IU/mL, and high zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) antibodies of 42 U/mL, consistent with an undiagnosed transition to latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). The blood glucose levels for previously reported cases remain between 90 and 250 mg/dL. In this case, the combination of a low carbohydrate diet and prolonged starvation may have led to the impressively low glucose. Additionally, the SGLT2 inhibitor use in patients with LADA serves as one of the known risk factors for EDKA. EDKA poses a diagnostic challenge, especially in the ICU setting where there exists a myriad of causes for high AG metabolic acidosis. Additionally, many of the ICU patients are in a ketotic state brought on by prolonged starvation. Therefore, prompt diagnosis and treatment for EDKA require careful history taking and complete investigation for other causes of high AG metabolic acidosis.",10.7759/cureus.24016,Web of Science

Multivariate logistic regression revealed that intentional ingestion was associated with endoscopic failure (odds ratio: 7.31; 95% confidence interval = 2.06-25.99; P = 0.002). ConclusionEndoscopy for FBIs is safe and successful, with low hospital admission rate in children, prisoners, and adults.

All articles were assessed for quality by 2 reviewers.Main ResultsThe 14 selected articles reported 52 FBI cases in which PoCUS successfully identified and located the ingested FB. Point-of-care ultrasound was used either as the primary imaging technique or after positive or negative x-ray findings. In 5 cases (9.6%), PoCUS was the only modality used for the diagnosis. Of these cases, 3 (60%) underwent a successful procedure to remove the FB and 2 (40%) received conservative treatment without complications.ConclusionsThis review suggests that PoCUS might be a reliable modality for the initial management of FBI. PoCUS can locate, identify, and evaluate the size of the FB in a wide range of materials and gastrointestinal locations. Point-of-care ultrasound could eventually become the go-to modality in the case of radiolucent FB, thus avoiding the use of radiation.

The disease patterns may be affected by breed and living and working conditions. This study reviewed medical data from the Armed Forces Medical Research Institute in the Republic of Korea. Gastrointestinal diseases due to foreign body ingestion were the most common. To prevent ingestive behavior disorders, such as foreign body ingestion, it is important to evaluate and improve the environment of military working dogs that may induce stress. Surgery for dental disease or the removal of a gastric foreign body was generally performed. Therefore, preventive care for dental disease and foreign body ingestion may be helpful for the effective performance and good quality of life in Korean military working dogs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate disease patterns among military working dogs (MWDs) at the Armed Forces Medical Research Institute (AFMRI) to provide basic medical data on Korean MWDs. The medical records of procedures performed at AFMRI between November 2017 and March 2021 were reviewed. Physical examination, diagnostic imaging, and laboratory tests were performed according to the status of each dog. A total of 353 MWDs (215 males and 138 females; mean age, 6 +/- 3 years) were analyzed in this study. Among Korean MWDs, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are the most frequently diagnosed, followed by dental and musculoskeletal disorders. Foreign body (FB) ingestion had the highest prevalence of GI disorders, with the most common FB being a leather collar or leash. General and dental surgeries, including removal of gastric FB and tooth extraction, were routinely performed at the AFMRI. Preventative care focusing on dental disease and FB ingestion may be helpful for effective performance and good quality of life in MWDs, with the regular assessment and prevention of environmental factors that may contribute to behavioral problems such as FB ingestion, coprophagy, and anorexia.",10.3390/ani13081400,Web of Science

In this case study, we report a case of lanthanum ingestion resulting in imaging consistent with ingested metallic foreign bodies. Hyperphosphatemia affects most patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with morbidity and mortality. Lanthanum carbonate reduces daily phosphate absorption and is indicated as a non-calcium-based phosphate binder in patients with ESRD. A 58-year-old man with a medical history of stage 5 chronic kidney disease was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hyperkalemia and acute respiratory failure after a missed dialysis session. He required vasopressors, intubation, and continuous renal replacement therapy. Admission imaging demonstrated several ingested metallic foreign bodies within the colon. There was consideration of colorectal surgery and gastroenterology consultation. On the initial medication reconciliation, no medications that would have the radiographic appearance of ingested metallic foreign bodies were identified. On further review of prescription data available through the electronic medical record, it was noted that the patient had recently filled a prescription for lanthanum despite its apparent discontinuation on a previous admission. After interviewing the patient's wife, it was confirmed that the patient had continued taking lanthanum and that he was swallowing it whole and not chewing it. No consultations or interventions were performed, and the metallic foreign bodies were no longer present on further imaging after a period of 35 days. Conclusion Escalation of care was avoided in this patient due to the performance of diligent medication reconciliation and recognition of the impact of lanthanum ingestion on imaging.",10.1093/ajhp/zxac380,Web of Science

Pediatric gastroenterologists and surgeons were increasingly tasked with removing these problematic objects. The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) in the management of ingested magnets. Patients and Methods: This is a single-center, retrospective assessment of surgical interventions for ingested magnets. International Classification of Disease, 10th revision codes were used to identify 349 patients ≤21 years of age evaluated for foreign body ingestion over a 4.5-year period. A medical record review helped isolate 29 (8.3%) magnet ingestions, 9 requiring surgical intervention. RedCap was used for analysis. Results: Of 9 surgical patients, 7 underwent SILS intervention by 1 surgeon. Another surgeon performed an open operation, whereas a third performed a multiport operation. Of the 7 SILS cases, 3 were completed without conversion to open. In one of these cases, bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed. For SILS cases, average operating room time was 109 minutes (38-170 minutes), time to enteral feeds was 23 hours (0.28-79.2 hours), and hospital length of stay (LOS) was 3.8 days (1.96-6.68 days). Thirty-day readmission for SILS was 14.3%. No other complications were observed. Conclusions: SILS has been safely utilized for magnet retrieval. It offers an ability to identify the affected intestinal segment and an opportunity to intervene extracorporeally through an uncapped port. In addition, knowing where matted bowel is located can direct a limited incision during conversion to laparotomy.

Most cases pass through the esophagus slowly; however, in some cases, the tumor may be located in narrower areas of the digestive tract that require endoscopic or surgical intervention. This study describes a rare case of successful removal of more than 450 pieces of metal objects from the stomach of a 36-year-old man via ingestion of foreign bodies at Imam Khomeini Hospital in Ahvaz. Case presentation: A 36-year-old male patient (Aryan race) presented with complaints of chronic abdominal pain, frequent vomiting, and intolerance to liquids and food. The patient’s companions mentioned a history of gradual ingestion of small metal objects 3 months prior. The patient was conscious and had stable vital signs. In the patient’s X-ray and endoscopy, multiple metal objects inside the patient’s stomach were observed, causing gastric outlet obstruction. The patient underwent gastrostomy surgery, and 452 screws, nuts, keys, stones, and other metal parts weighing 2900 g were removed from the stomach. Five days after the operation, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric service in good general condition and was diagnosed with psychosis, and her condition returned to normal at follow-up. Conclusion: Successful removal of this foreign body is rare. In chronic abdominal pain, especially in the context of psychiatric disorders, attention should be given to the ingestion of foreign bodies. In swallowing large amounts of sharp and metallic foreign objects, surgical intervention is necessary, especially in cases of obstruction, and saves the patient’s life.",10.1186/s13256-024-04672-3,Embase

While the phenomenon has been reported on, primarily from a psychiatric perspective, this report will present the effects of this behavior on the intestinal system from a pathology perspective. The report is of a 43-year-old female with a past medical history of foreign object ingestion, borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety, and prior suicidality who passed away due to bowel obstruction. Review of her history revealed an eighteen-year history of repeated foreign body ingestion with multiple surgical interventions. A particularly remarkable aspect revealed through the surgical history is the nature of the complications. They begin in 2008 with bowel perforation due to a blunt object and continue to present with perforation in the early years but show a gradual change to adhesions and obstruction as the primary concern. Her final presentation to the hospital and cause of death was due to obstruction, not perforation, even though the foreign bodies were six knives. While this case is not the only known report of foreign body ingestion, the extensive timeline and frequency allow for an examination of the gradual progression of fibrosis and adhesions within the intestines and abdominal wall, which led to the obstruction and death despite being a protective factor against further perforation. © 2024 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.",,SCOPUS

The diagnosis of intestinal perforation following blister ingestion is often delayed because of an unreliable history and nonspecific clinical presentation. The purpose of this case report is to raise awareness about a rare but difficult diagnosis and its importance in avoiding potentially fatal events. Case Reports: Herein, we describe successful cases of surgical and endoscopic removal after blister ingestion. The first case was that of a polymorbid 75-year-old man who presented with acute onset of abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant and epigastric regions. No indication of the cause was observed on initial computed tomography (CT). The patient developed an acute abdomen, and emergency laparotomy was performed, during which 2 small perforations were observed in the terminal ileum, and an empty tablet blister was retrieved. The second patient was a 55-year-old man who presented with a considerable lack of awareness. On the initial CT, a subdural hematoma, aspiration, and an unidentified foreign body in the stomach were observed. Gastroscopy was performed after emergency craniotomy. In addition to the initial foreign body, a second object, which had gone unnoticed on the initial CT, was found and removed from the esophagus.

Purpose: To evaluate the potential value of computed tomography (CT) in guiding the selection of surgical treatment for patients with ingested foreign bodies in the lower gastrointestinal tract. Methods: Between January 2014 and December 2023, we analyzed the data of 58 patients (median age: 65.4 years; range, 31–96 years) with ingested foreign bodies in the lower gastrointestinal tract who underwent CT examinations. Patients were treated either conservatively (35 cases) or surgically (23 cases). The angle between the long axis of the foreign body and the intestinal canal (FB-IC angle) was measured. CT findings and clinical variables were evaluated to identify potential indicators for surgical treatment through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results: Univariate analysis revealed the FB-IC angle (P = 0.002), presence of free peritoneal gas (P = 0.002), white blood cell count (P = 0.018), and neutrophil count (P = 0.007) as significant factors associated with surgical treatment. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the FB-IC angle (odds ratio, 1.033; P = 0.045) and the presence of free peritoneal gas (odds ratio, 41.335; P = 0.002) are independent indicators for surgical management. The FB-IC angle showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.755, with a cutoff value of 51.25 degrees. Conclusion: The FB-IC angle and presence of free peritoneal gas serve as potential predictive imaging markers for surgical intervention.
