\subsection{Subgroup Data}

From Table~\ref{tab:population_summary}, we observe that 39.7\% of the population had a psychiatric history, 20.7\% were prisoners, and 19.0\% had a history of previous ingestions. Smaller proportions were psychiatric inpatients (6.9\%), had a history of severe disability (5.2\%), were displaced persons (3.4\%), or were under the influence of alcohol (3.4\%) at the time of presentation.

From Table~\ref{tab:motivation_summary}, the most frequently recorded motivations were unknown (34.5\%), intent to harm (32.8\%), and psychiatric reasons (31.0\%). Psychosocial motivations accounted for 20.7\% of cases, followed by protest-related ingestion (13.8\%), and motivations classified as 'other' (12.1\%). Additional subcategories included 'Other Psych Hx' (6.9\%).

From Table~\ref{tab:object_summary}, the most commonly ingested object types were long objects (50\%), sharp objects (41.4\%), and multiple objects (39.7\%). Less frequently, ingestions involved long sharp objects (17.2\%), magnets (5.2\%), while no cases involved button batteries (0.0\%).

From Table~\ref{tab:outcome_summary}, surgical intervention was the most common outcome (72.4\%), followed by injuries requiring intervention (53.4\%) and perforation (36.2\%). Endoscopy was performed in 26.3\% of cases. Other outcomes included miscellaneous findings (22.4\%), conservative management (10.3\%), death (8.6\%), and obstruction (8.6\%).

We can expand on the 'Outcome\_Other' by examining the comments made during Data Extraction. This is shown in Table~\ref{tab:outcome-other-summary}.

\subsubsection*{Interpretation}

From Table~\ref{tab:top-correlations} several strong correlations were observed between key variables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Psychiatric history} showed a strong positive correlation with \textbf{psychiatric motivation} ($r = 0.83$), as expected.
    \item \textbf{Injury requiring intervention} was strongly associated with \textbf{perforation} ($r = 0.70$), aligning with clinical severity.
    \item \textbf{Being a prisoner} was notably linked to \textbf{protest-related motivation} ($r = 0.54$).
    \item \textbf{Surgical intervention} correlated positively with both \textbf{injury needing intervention} ($r = 0.51$) and \textbf{perforation} ($r = 0.47$), while showing negative associations with \textbf{conservative management} ($r = -0.55$) and \textbf{psychiatric motivation} ($r = -0.42$).
    \item \textbf{Endoscopy} was negatively associated with both \textbf{sharp object ingestion} ($r = -0.43$) and \textbf{perforation} ($r = -0.37$).
    \item \textbf{Conservative management} negatively correlated with \textbf{injury needing intervention} ($r = -0.36$) but showed a positive association with \textbf{previous ingestions} ($r = 0.41$).
    \item \textbf{Psychiatric motivation} also correlated positively with \textbf{multiple object ingestion} ($r = 0.37$), possibly reflecting impulsivity or complexity in intent.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Aggregate Data}

These columns represent aggregate data computed using Python and the \texttt{pandas} library. They summarise key demographic, clinical, motivational, object-related, and outcome variables—such as age ranges, gender distribution, psychiatric history, ingestion motivations, and clinical outcomes like endoscopy or surgery rates. Each variable is captured in terms of both absolute case counts (e.g., \textit{Psych\_Hx\_Cases}) and proportions relative to the total number of cases (e.g., \textit{Psych\_Hx\_Rate}). 

This structure enables case data from individual reports and small case series to be standardised into a common format. As described earlier in the report, this method of generating aggregate-level data is designed to support the integration of studies with differing data structures, particularly larger studies where individual-level data may not be available. By reducing heterogeneity in data format and content, these aggregated variables facilitate comparative analysis across diverse sources, strengthening the overall synthesis in case series and systematic reviews.

Columns are listed below and can be generated computationally where individual case data is available. The Python-based workflow allows for flexible and scalable creation of additional \texttt{\_Cases} and \texttt{\_Rate} columns for any new variables of interest, enabling consistent integration of diverse data sources into a unified structure.
