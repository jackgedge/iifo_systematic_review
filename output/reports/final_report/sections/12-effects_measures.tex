\subsection*{Effects Measures Analysis (Summary)}
Univariate associations between binary predictors (e.g., motivation, object type) and binary outcomes (e.g., endoscopy, surgery, complications) were assessed using odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), via chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests \cite{Machin_2008}. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors, with models adjusted for age, gender, motivation, and object characteristics, and fitted using \textit{statsmodels} in Python \cite{Seabold_2010}. For case series, meta-analyses of proportions and univariate meta-regression explored outcome frequencies and associated factors using random-effects models and inverse-variance weighted regression. Full methodology is detailed in Appendix~\ref{appendix:effects_measures}.
