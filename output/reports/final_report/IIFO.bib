It has attracted great interest among mental health  professionals over the last decades. However, this issue is rarely reported in  the literature. A deep exploration of its clinical and specific  psychopathological aspects remains limited. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a  32-year-old female patient, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for homicide  against her cousin, the daughter of an uncle who had raped her when she was 14.  This affair was hushed by the patient's family and the patient was submitted to  several acts of abuse by her family. Following her incarceration, she repeatedly  ingested metallic objects requiring repeated admissions in a department of  surgery for endoscopic extractions or surgical interventions. She impulsively  ingested more than 30 times various metallic objects such as wire, razor blades,  spoons, etc., under the pressure of impulsiveness and massive anxiety. Voluntary  metal ingestions, associated with iterative self-mutilation behaviors, took place  within the framework of a borderline personality disorder, the incarceration and  the conditions of imprisonment playing a role in initiating and retaining the  behavior. CONCLUSION: Through this case report, we examine the specific  psychiatric aspects of intentional ingestion of metallic objects in order to  better understand this behavior.},

The number of foreign bodies found at the emergency units of many hospitals is quite large. These include coins, safety pins, sewing needles, button batteries and nuts. However, many of the foreign bodies are excreted safely without any untoward events, except for foreign bodies with sharp ends, containing toxic chemicals and where there is a pre-existing anatomical abnormality in the gastro-Intestinal Tract (GIT). Foreign bodies, especially those with sharp ends are prone to getting arrested, inflicting mucosal erosion or even perforating any part of the GIT, particularly at the site of physiologic or anatomic constrictions. These areas are the three Oesophageal anatomic narrowing, the pylorus, Ileo-Caecal valve and the recto-sigmoid junction. Most foreign bodies can be seen on plain radiograph, removal, where indicated, can be done endoscopically or through an open surgery. But, majority can be managed expectantly, aided by patience, careful serial radiographic monitoring and perhaps use of lubricating solutions like liquid paraffin.},

The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate the risk factors that could prone cats to ingest FB. This study was retrospectively conducted on sixty-five cats that had been diagnosed with FB obstruction. On the other hand, sixty-five cats that had no clinical findings suggestive of gastrointestinal illnesses were used as controls. Among cats with gastrointestinal illnesses, we found that 9.97\% had FB obstructions. The most common presenting breeds of both cat patients with FB obstruction and controls were Persian and Siamese. Similarly, most of the presented normal and diseased cats were males. Cats with FB were younger (p{$<$}0.05) than those of control cats. There was no significant difference in the body weight for cats with FB versus control cats. Among the investigated factors, we also observed that living style, anxiety/stress, and frequency of exercise were the only factors that were strongly associated with the occurrence of FB obstruction. In conclusion, observations of this study indicate that a living style, anxiety/stress, and frequency of exercise have a significant impact on cat behavior and should be seen by cat-owned clients as important to prevent pica. Thus, the likelihood of blockage of the gastrointestinal tract by foreign bodies can be reduced.},

Material and methods The study was retrospective, conducted on peri-implant specimens submitted for histology between 2005 and 2021. Results Three hundred and thirty-five peri-implant biopsies were retrieved, of which 52 (15.5\%) were PGCG. The study population included 28 females and 24 males, age 35-92 years, mean 61. 51.2\% reported bone involvement. The lesion involved the margins of the specimen in 65.3\%, recurrence was reported in 46.1\%. In 58.8\% the implant was removed at the same time the specimen was submitted for histopathological analysis. Small foci of black granular foreign material were observed in 53.8\% of cases of which 67.8\% were birefringent under polarized light. The foreign material granules were not ingested inside multinucleated giant cells, but were scattered in the stromal compartment. Conclusions Peri-implant PGCG is locally aggressive, with frequent bone involvement and high recurrence rate, resulting in implant loss in the majority of cases. The high recurrence rate may be related to conservative or inadequate surgery. Foreign material although common does not seem to have a role in its development.},

We describe the case of a 27-year-old lady with recurrent episodes and the dilemma faced in management. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: 26-year-old lady with a past medical history multiple psychiatric disorders and an 8 year history of recurrent radio-opaque foreign body ingestion. She ingested a screw driver shaft and had previously ingested razor blades, 60 paper clips, spoons, bobby pins, pens, phone stylus. She required many esophagogastroduodenoscopies(EGDs) .Open laparotomy was done once for gastric perforation. Recurrent ingestion was related to craving anesthetic agents as a means of relieving anxiety. At review, her vital signs were stable. The foreign body was visualized on x ray and successfully removed from the stomach using a snare at EGD.Her medications were adjusted by psychiatry. She represented a month later after swallowing an unfolded paper clip confirmed on imaging. Due to lack of symptoms and adjudged low risk, EGD was not done, leaving her dissatisfied. DISCUSSION: Foreign body ingestion is more common in children compared to adults. Adult foreign body ingestion is increasing.(1) Recurrent intentional ingestion is more common in the elderly, prisoners and people with underlying psychiatric disorders.(2) Acuphagia is a form of pica, the consumption of non-nutritious substances. This patient had many psychiatric diagnoses. Most foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract spontaneously. Some require intervention. European guidelines recommend conservative management for asymptomatic patients with ingestion of small, blunt objects (except batteries and magnets)(3). Indications for endoscopy include symptomatic patients, ingestion of sharp or pointed materials, batteries, magnets and large substances. Those with complications, for example perforation, intestinal obstruction require surgery. Our patient required multiple upper gastrointestinal endoscopies. Although largely asymptomatic, she mainly ingested sharp metal objects that put her at a risk for perforation.Managing this patient was challenging due to multiple presentations. Medication readjustments to manage anxiety thereby preventing recurrences were not fully successful. The threshold for endoscopy was raised. Propofol is being avoided for endoscopy as much as possible as this was the specific agent she craved.},

  abstract = {Publication bias refers to a systematic deviation from the truth in the results of a meta-analysis due to the higher likelihood for published studies to be included in meta-analyses than unpublished studies. Publication bias can lead to misleading recommendations for decision and policy making. In this education review, we introduce, explain, and provide solutions to the pervasive misuses and misinterpretations of publication bias that afflict evidence syntheses in sport and exercise medicine, with a focus on the commonly used funnel-plot based methods. Publication bias is more routinely assessed by visually inspecting funnel plot asymmetry, although it has been consistently deemed unreliable, leading to the development of statistical tests to assess publication bias. However, most statistical tests of publication bias (i) cannot rule out alternative explanations for funnel plot asymmetry (e.g., between-study heterogeneity, choice of metric, chance) and (ii) are grossly underpowered, even when using an arbitrary minimum threshold of ten or more studies. We performed a cross-sectional meta-research investigation of how publication bias was assessed in systematic reviews with meta-analyses published in the top two sport and exercise medicine journals throughout 2021. This analysis highlights that publication bias is frequently misused and misinterpreted, even in top tier journals. Because of conceptual and methodological problems when assessing and interpreting publication bias, preventive strategies (e.g., pre-registration, registered reports, disclosing protocol deviations, and reporting all study findings regardless of direction or magnitude) offer the best and most efficient solution to mitigate the misuse and misinterpretation of publication bias. Because true publication bias is very difficult to determine, we recommend that future publications use the term ``risk of publication bias''.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Recognition of some of the limitations of titanium plates and screws used for the fixation of bones has led to the development of plates manufactured from bioresorbable materials. Whilst resorbable plates appear to offer clinical advantages over metal plates in orthognathic surgery, concerns remain about the stability of fixation and the length of time required for their degradation and the possibility of foreign body reactions. This review compares the use of titanium versus bioresorbable plates in orthognathic surgery and is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2007. Objectives To compare the effects of bioresorbable fixation systems with titanium systems used during orthognathic surgery. Search methods Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 20 January 2017); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 11) in the Cochrane Library (searched 20 January 2017); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 20 January 2017); and Embase Ovid (1980 to 20 January 2017). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov ( clinicaltrials.gov ; searched 20 January 2017), and the  World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform  (searched 20 January 2017) for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing bioresorbable versus titanium fixation systems used for orthognathic surgery in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the results of the electronic searches, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We resolved disagreement by discussion. Clinical heterogeneity between the included trials precluded pooling of data, and only a descriptive summary is presented. Main results This review included two trials, involving 103 participants, one comparing titanium with resorbable plates and screws and the other titanium with resorbable screws. Both studies were at high risk of bias and provided very limited data for the primary outcomes of this review. All participants in one trial suffered mild to moderate postoperative discomfort with no statistically significant difference between the two plating groups at different follow-up times. Mean scores of patient satisfaction were 7.43 to 8.63 (range 0 to 10) with no statistically significant difference between the two groups throughout follow-up. Adverse effects reported in one study were two plate exposures in each group occurring between the third and ninth months. Plate exposures occurred mainly in the posterior maxillary region, except for one titanium plate exposure in the mandibular premolar region. Known causes of infection were associated with loosened screws and wound dehiscence with no statistically significant difference in the infection rate between titanium (3/196), and resorbable (3/165) plates. Authors' conclusions We do not have sufficient evidence to determine if titanium plates or resorbable plates are superior for fixation of bones after orthognathic surgery. This review provides insufficient evidence to show any difference in postoperative pain and discomfort, level of patient satisfaction, plate exposure or infection for plate and screw fixation using either titanium or resorbable materials. Plain language summary Resorbable versus titanium plates for corrective jaw surgery Review question Are resorbable (biodegradable) plates better than titanium (metal) plates for the fixation of facial bones after corrective (orthognathic) jaw surgery? Background Under- or overgrowth of one or both of the jaw bones can lead to reduced function and an unattractive facial appearance, either of which may have lasting and significant psychosocial effects. Treatment of severe cases may require a combination of orthodontic appliances and orthognathic (corrective jaw) surgery. After surgery the cut bone needs to be immobilised to ensure that optimal healing takes place. Titanium plates used for fixation are recognised to be the 'gold standard' but recent developments in biomaterials have led to an increased use of bioresorbable plates or screws for corrective jaw surgery. The use of bioresorbable plates for the fixation of facial bones might appear to reduce the need for a further operation for the removal of metal plates. However, whilst resorbable plates do appear to offer certain advantages over metal plates, concerns remain about the stability of fixation, the length of time required for their resorption (being reabsorbed), the possibility of foreign body reactions, and with some of the technical difficulties experienced with resorbable plates. Study characteristics We included two studies that analysed a total of 103 participants. The evidence in this review is up to date as of 20 January 2017. Study participants were adults older than 16 years of age. One study compared titanium with resorbable plates and screws and the other titanium with resorbable screws. One study was conducted in China, the other in Germany. Key results Both studies were at high risk of bias and provided very limited data. We do not have sufficient evidence to determine if titanium plates or resorbable plates are superior for the fixation of bones after corrective jaw surgery. This review provides insufficient evidence to show any difference in postoperative pain and discomfort, level of patient satisfaction, plate exposure or infection for plate and screw fixation using either titanium or resorbable materials. Quality of the evidence Both included studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias and the very limited and weak evidence was of very low quality.},

Factors influencing morbidity and mortality among studied  patients will be deliberated as well. METHODS: It is a hospital-based descriptive  study where all children between birth and 16 years of age who were admitted to  Sohag University Hospital, Egypt from January 1st, 2018, to December 31st, 2020,  for FBs removal were analyzed. All cases were subjected to complete history  taking, physical, radiological, and bronchoscopic examination. RESULTS: A total  of fourteen [14] patients were presented with FBI based on a full history,  examination, and essential investigation. The vast majority 92.9\% of presented  cases (13 out of 14) were less than 6 years old. 50\% of them (50\%) (7 out of 14)  were less than one year old. Most cases presented early within a few hours after  ingestion (71.4\%). Two [2] patients had predisposing conditions like mental  retardation and cerebral palsy. 28.6\% of cases presented late ({$>$}\,24~h after  aspiration). Except for one case where a cervical oesophageal approach was  needed. Endoscopic extractions of foreign bodies were successfully done. 50\% of  patients required admissions to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). The  mortality rate was 14.3\%. CONCLUSION: FBI is a common clinical emergency in  children younger than 6 years. A high index of suspicion is the keystone for  diagnosis. Early detection and management are crucial for a positive outcome.},

  abstract = {Self-\-harm within immigration detention centres has been a widely documented phenomenon, occurring at far higher rates than the wider community. Evidence suggests that factors such as the conditions of detention and uncertainty about refugee status are among the most prominent precipitators of self-\-harm. While important in explaining self-h\- arm, this is not the entire story. In this paper, we argue for a more overtly political interpretation of detainee self-\-harm as resistance and assess the ethical implications of this view, drawing on interviews with detainees from Australia's offshore system. Self-\-harm by detainees is not only a medical 'condition' arising in response to oppression but a form of political action to lessen or contest it. We first establish how self-\-harm could be conceptualised as resistance. We then discuss its political purpose, noting it serves at least three functions: intrinsic, instrumental and disruptive or coercive. Viewing detainee self-\- harm as political resistance is a supplement to (rather than a substitute for) a medical approach. However, conceptualising self-\-harm this way has several advantages, namely, moving away from the idea that such behaviour is 'maladaptive', recognising detainees as political agents, combatting government claims of 'manipulation' and 'blackmail' and clarifying the duties of healthcare workers who work in detention.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to perform a comparative analysis of the examination and treatment outcomes of children with cylindrical and button  batteries (BB) ingestion depending on their size and anatomical locations.  METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of 124 children aged from  1~month to 18~years who ingested batteries and were treated in a tertiary care  center from January 1, 2014 to March 31, 2019. The data studied included age,  sex, presenting symptoms at the time of evaluation, type and size of battery and  modality of management. RESULTS: Twenty-three (18.5\%) patients ingested  cylindrical batteries (CBs), and 101 (81.5\%) ingested BBs. The duration of  hospital stay was significantly longer (p\,=\,0.004) in the group of children who  ingested BBs larger than 20~mm. Endoscopic removal was performed in 75 (60.5\%)  children, 46 (37.1\%) were followed up and three (2.4\%) underwent open surgeries.  Children with CBs ingestion, in 55\% of cases, had gastric mucosal injuries.  Children with BBs impacted in the esophagus in 96\% cases had visible severe  mucosal damage, whereas patients with gastric BB ingestion 19.5\% had superficial  gastric mucosal damage. CONCLUSION: Performing timely endoscopic retrieval in  children who are admitted early to the hospital will reduce the risk of damage to  the gastrointestinal mucosa, especially in the stomach. Unlike BBs, CBs, despite  their large size, have advantageous shapes, uneventfully pass the esophagus and  are more often retained in the stomach; thus, mucosal injuries are more often  observed in the stomach. Consequently, endoscopic extraction is the treatment of  choice for children with BB ingestion.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The swallowing of foreign bodies can be accidental or intentional. The majority of the cases of accidental foreign body ingestion are observed in children. In adults, foreign body ingestion can be accidental, related to specific pathological changes of the digestive tract, or deliberate, as observed in patients with psychiatric diseases or in those released from the prison. CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with symptoms including choking, drooling from the mouth, holding his neck, and aphonia. He had a history of psychiatric illness with suicidal ingestion of a foreign body. After stabilization, he was sent for chest radiograph, which revealed a significant radiopaque shadow the shape of a spanner, occupying the whole length of the esophagus. Emergency rigid esophagoscopy was performed to save the patient's life. DISCUSSION: The patient swallowed the largest hard foreign body to harm himself or his family, to get the attention of his family, or as a suicide attempt. Such patients require urgent intervention by rigid esophagoscopy to reduce the risk of complications and to save the patients' lives. Further follow-up is essential due to the possibility of repeated foreign body ingestion. CONCLUSION: While taking care of psychiatric patients, close observation by family members is mandatory to prevent them from harming themselves and to prevent suicide attempts by swallowing sharp, hard, large, and dangerous foreign bodies such as the size 17 wrench spanner observed in the present case.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A retrospective review was performed on 180 patients from 1975 to 1997 to evaluate the diagnosis, and management of esophageal foreign bodies. METHODS: All patients except two were symptomatic and 145 of them were younger than 14 years of age. Plain films were performed in every patient with a suspected esophageal foreign body (EFB). In all patients, rigid esophagoscopy was done under general anesthesia once the diagnosis of impacted EFB is made. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of the foreign bodies were coins. In children, the majority of impacted esophageal foreign bodies were located at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle while in adults the site of impaction was the lower esophageal sphincter. The most common symptoms were vomiting and or regurgitation. Of the 180 EFBs encountered, 169 were extracted endoscopically, five were pushed into the stomach, five were not found, and one patient needed cervicotomy. There were no deaths in this series. Predisposing factors were found in 15 patients. Fifteen patients (8.3\%) had benign strictures. In ten patients (5.5\%), minor complications were encountered, none of which were esophagoscopically related. Alternative diagnostic and therapeutic modalities are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: All patients with a history of suspected foreign body ingestion should have direct endoscopic examination. If the EFB is not detected a thorough radiographic examination, including CT scan, should be performed to detect a possible intra- or extraluminal object. Preservation of the airway is regarded to be the most important consideration in esophageal foreign body management.},

Ingestion of multiple  high-power magnet pieces is unique and increases the risk of morbidity and  mortality. The longer the duration of ingestion, the increased likelihood of  complications. Various management options have been reported, and there is no  consensus on the ideal management which necessitates the need for a practical  algorithm. The incidence of magnet ingestion has been increasing and directly  related to the laws and recalls. The aim of this review is to provide an easy and  practical pathway for management and to highlight the preventive rules of the  legislations and recalls. Methods: PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of  Systematic Reviews, and the list of references from all identified complete  publications were searched for all publications in English-language for pediatric  magnet ingestion. Conclusion: Practical and time-saving management pathways are  recommended to minimize the risk of complications. Preventive rules and recalls  are important for eliminating the availability of these hazardous magnets. Public  awareness about the unique risks posed by these magnets if ingested is important.},

  abstract = {Background: Foreign-body ingestion is a common event most often seen in children from 6 months to 6 years of age. In adults, foreign bodies are usually ingested accidentally together with food. This happens more commonly in persons with certain pathological changes of the gastrointestinal tract. Methods: We present a selective review of pertinent literature retrieved by a search in the PubMed database. Results: The foreign bodies most commonly ingested by adults are fish bones and chicken bones. The clinical approach to the problem depends on the type of material ingested and on the patient's symptoms and physical findings. In about 80\% of cases, the ingested material passes uneventfully through the gastrointestinal tract; endoscopy is performed in about 20\% of cases, and surgery in less than 1\%. Emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is recommended when the esophagus is completely occluded (because of the risk of aspiration and/or pressure necrosis), when the ingested object has a sharp point or edge (because of the risk of perforation, with ensuing mediastinitis or peritonitis), and when a battery has been ingested (because of the risk of necrosis and fistula formation). For non-occluding esophageal foreign bodies, including magnets, an urgent but non-emergency EGD within 12 to 24 hours is recommended. Conclusion: Most patients can be treated conservatively by observation alone, but there should be a low threshold for deciding to proceed to endoscopic retrieval. Surgery is reserved for complicated cases. ►Cite this as: Ambe P, Weber SA, Schauer M, Knoefel WT: Swallowed foreign bodies in adults. Dtsch Arztebl Int 2012; 109(50): 869-75.

This study aims to present the global prevalence of suicide between immigrants and refugees as well as to report the prevalence of suicide ideation, suicide mortality, suicide attempts, and plan of suicide. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA's) rules were used as a guide in the current research path. PubMed and EMBASE were targeted for the study until December 2019. After collecting the data, the number of events and sample size extracted for each study and also pooled odds ratio and confidence interval (CI) were used to investigate the suicide ratio among immigrants and refugees compared to the native population. Fifty-one studies were included in the meta-analysis to investigate suicide prevalence or suicide odds ratio. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 16\% (CI: 0.12--0.20, I2 = 99.4\%), for attempted suicide was 6\% (CI: 0.05--0.08, I2 = 98.0\%), and for suicide plan prevalence was 4\% (CI: 0.00--0.08, I2 = 96.8\%). The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 10\% (CI: 0.04--0.17, I2 = 0.0\%) in men and 17\% (CI: 0.10--0.24, I2 = 96.8\%) in women. The prevalence of attempted suicide was 1\% (CI: 0.01--0.02, I2 = 0.0\%) in men and 7\% (CI: 0.03--0.10, I2 = 94.4\%) in women. The odds ratio of suicide mortality among immigrants was 0.91 (CI: 0.90--0.93, p {$<$} 0.001; I2 = 97.6\%) and for attempted suicide was 1.15 (CI: 1.10--1.20, p {$<$} 0.001; I2 = 92.0\%). Begg's test (p = 0.933) (Egger test; p = 0.936) rejected publication bias. Given the high prevalence of suicide, especially suicide ideation and suicide attempts in immigrants, increased attention needs to be paid to the mental health of this population.},

In this context, the  Commissariat {\`a} l'Energie Atomique has created a working group on speciation to  share data both on thermodynamic constants and on speciation analysis methods of  interest to chemists, environmentalists and biologists. The initial focus was on  the 31 radionuclides described in different International Commission on  Radiological Protection models (HRTM, HAT) and the National Council on Radiation  Protection model (wound). Particular attention was devoted to selecting the  inorganic and organic ligands, most representative of biological media. The base  applied to speciation in solution and at interfaces and solubility (BASSIST)  thermodynamic database was developed for this purpose. The aim of this paper is  to present the state of the art on radionuclide speciation tools within  biological media and to emphasise some missing data in order to orient future  research.},

  abstract = {Foreign bodies may be ingested accidentally or intentionally. Generally, they pass through the digestive tract without causing complications unless they become  lodged. Patients often present with nonspecific clinical symptoms, and diagnosis  is frequently delayed because they do not recall ingesting anything. We report  the case of a 20-year-old man who was admitted to the emergency room for acute  moderate hematemesis. The patient had no significant medical history. An urgent,  nonsedated upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy was performed, which revealed  bleeding but no foreign objects. However, an abdominal CT scan identified a  linear calcified object in the antrum, which was later confirmed to be a chicken  bone upon endoscopic extraction. Ingested foreign bodies typically pass through  the digestive tract without incident. However, long, sharp, and thin objects can  remain in the gastrointestinal tract for 7-10 days and may become lodged in areas  of physiological narrowing. This can lead to complications such as bowel  obstruction, perforation, or bleeding.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Endoscopic foreign body retrieval in the upper gastrointestinal tract is well established, however indications for endoscopy for  retained foreign bodies in the lower gastrointestinal tract and specifically the  right colon is still being navigated [3]. A PubMed and Google Scholar search  discovered a variety of case reports detailing various methods and indications  for endoscopic retrieval of right sided colonic foreign bodies. This case report  endeavors to supplement the literature so that guidelines can one day be  established for colonoscopic retrieval of right-sided foreign bodies. CASE  PRESENTATION: 36-year-old male prisoner swallowed 6.5~cm nail clippers with a  long-standing history of intentional foreign body ingestion (FBI) including  multiple laparotomies for foreign body retrievals. Computerized tomography (CT)  was used initially to confirm the position of the nail clippers. After almost two  weeks of failure of the foreign body (FB) to move beyond the caecum as  demonstrated on plain abdominal X-rays, the patient had a colonoscopy with  successful retrieval of the FB. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: This case report hopes to  encourage the consideration of colonoscopy for retrieval of right sided colonic  foreign bodies that have failed to pass on their own and where an operation may  come with increased risk (multiple laparotomies, multiple comorbidities, and  higher anaesthetic risk for a general anaesthetic). Colonoscopy/endoscopy still  has inherent risk and this patient did have an episode of temporary laryngospasm  that required intubation and monitoring in the intensive care unit post  operatively. Despite this the patient recovered and was discharged day one post  procedure without further complication. The case report has been reported in line  with the SCARE 2020 criteria (Agha et al., 2020 [2]). CONCLUSION: Indications for  consideration of endoscopic retrieval of foreign bodies in the right colon have  not been entirely detailed as endoscopy is for upper gastrointestinal foreign  bodies. This case report documents the indications for endoscopy in the clinical  context of a recurrent FBI and a history of multiple laparotomies with failure of  the FB to move beyond the caecum.},

  abstract = {Background: A ban on neodymium magnets was lifted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission in 2016. Pediatric gastroenterologists and surgeons were  increasingly tasked with removing these problematic objects. The purpose of this  study was to assess the utility of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) in  the management of ingested magnets. Patients and Methods: This is a  single-center, retrospective assessment of surgical interventions for ingested  magnets. International Classification of Disease, 10th revision codes were used  to identify 349 patients {$\leq$}21 years of age evaluated for foreign body ingestion  over a 4.5-year period. A medical record review helped isolate 29 (8.3\%) magnet  ingestions, 9 requiring surgical intervention. RedCap was used for analysis.  Results: Of 9 surgical patients, 7 underwent SILS intervention by 1 surgeon.  Another surgeon performed an open operation, whereas a third performed a  multiport operation. Of the 7 SILS cases, 3 were completed without conversion to  open. In one of these cases, bowel resection with primary anastomosis was  performed. For SILS cases, average operating room time was 109 minutes (38-170  minutes), time to enteral feeds was 23 hours (0.28-79.2 hours), and hospital  length of stay (LOS) was 3.8 days (1.96-6.68 days). Thirty-day readmission for  SILS was 14.3\%. No other complications were observed. Conclusions: SILS has been  safely utilized for magnet retrieval. It offers an ability to identify the  affected intestinal segment and an opportunity to intervene extracorporeally  through an uncapped port. In addition, knowing where matted bowel is located can  direct a limited incision during conversion to laparotomy. This may confer  benefits of decreased pain, shortened time to enteral feeds, and decreased  hospital LOS.},

CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old man was admitted with massive upper  gastrointestinal bleeding 10 days after swallowing a fish bone. Computed  tomography demonstrated a fistula from the proximal descending thoracic aorta to  the mid esophagus. The bleeding was initially controlled by inflating a  Sengstaken-Blakemore tube. A 28-mm x 16-cm Talent stent-graft was delivered  transfemorally to repair the aortic defect; the esophageal injury was repaired  primarily using a pedicled intercostal muscle flap via a right thoracotomy. Chest  radiography at 12 months showed no migration of the stent-graft. Blood parameters  of infection were normal; the patient remains well 18 months after stent-graft  implantation.

On examination, she had multiple old self-inflicted scars on her arms, wrists and thighs. She admitted that she had swallowed ten razor blades after coating them with chewing gum but she denied any intentions to hurt herself. Vitals were stable and her physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory work up was within normal with stable hemoglobin and hemarocrit. Acute abdominal X-ray showed razor blades overlying the upper abdomen, likely in the gastric antrum (Figure 1). Four days later, repeated X-rays showed multiple razor blades present in the rectum (Figure 2). Eventually, all razor blades were passed. Psychiatry was consulted for management of schizoaffective schizophrenia and she was restarted on her home medications. She was discharged in a stable condition.},

Particularly, emergency treatment is required for cutting and drilling bodies. The majority of ingested foreign bodies (80-90\%) leave gastrointestinal tract without creating problems. In 10-20\% of cases, intervention is absolutely required. Less than 1\% of cases need surgery. In this paper, we present a schizophrenia patient who swallowed multiple lighters. Case. A 21-year-old male schizophrenic patient who uses psychotic drugs presented to the emergency department with the complaints of abdominal pain, severe vomiting, and inability to swallow for a week. His physical examination revealed epigastric tenderness. A plain radiograph of the abdomen revealed multiple tiny metallic densities. Gastroscopy was performed. The lighters were not allowing the passage, and some of them had penetrated the gastric mucosa, and bezoars were observed. One lighter was extracted with the help of the polypectomy snare. Other lighters as a bezoar were removed by surgery. Conclusion. Excessive vomiting of swallowed foreign bodies in the etiology of psychotic patients should be kept in mind. Endoscopic therapy can be performed in the early stages in these patients, but in the late stage surgery is inevitable.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A retrospective study was conducted in 400 patients with esophageal foreign bodies (EFB) to assess characteristics of EFB and methods of treatment. METHODS: From 1962 through 1998, 400 patients with EFB were treated in our department on an emergency basis. There were 202 men (50\%) and 198 women (49.6\%) ranging in age from 1.5 to 95 years. The main symptoms patients complained of were difficulty in swallowing and pain. Detailed anamnesis, oropharynx and hypopharynx examination and finally radiological examination were the diagnostic tools. The location of the FB was in the cervical esophagus in 57\% of cases, in the thoracic one in 26\% and at the cardioesophageal junction in 17\%. The most common objects found were bones, morsels, coins and needles. RESULTS: The treatment consisted of rigid esophagoscopy under general anesthesia in 343 (85.7\%) of our cases. In 57 cases (14.3\%) other means such as flexible esophagoscopy, Fogarty or Foley catheters and bougienage turned to be very useful. Only 12 patients (3\%) were led to surgery because either extraction was impossible or perforation was present. No major complications occurred in the surgical group, whereas in the group of rigid esophagoscopy, there was one iatrogenous esophageal perforation that presented with empyema thoracis successfully treated. Finally, there was a case of an aortoesophageal fistula with mortal outcome perioperatively. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Esophagoscopy is a reliable method in the treatment of EFB impaction. (2) Alternative methods such as bougienage, etc., can be used only in selected cases with smooth foreign bodies. (3) Surgical treatment is unavoidable in cases of irretrievable EFB or esophageal perforation.},

Our objective was to evaluate the  guidelines' impact on in-hospital resource utilization and short-term clinical  outcomes in hemodynamically stable patients after endoscopic battery removal.  METHODS: A single-center retrospective review of all EBBI admissions from 2010 to  2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on adoption of national  guidelines: pre-guideline (2010-2015) and post-guideline (2016-2020). RESULTS:  Sixty-five patients were studied (pre-guideline n\,=\,23; post-guideline n\,=\,42).  Compared with pre-guideline, post-guideline use of magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) increased (2/23 [8.7\%]; 30/42 [71.4\%]; p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Post-guideline increases  resulted for median days (IQR) receiving antibiotics (0 [0, 4]; 6 [3, 8];  p\,=\,0.01), total pediatric intensive care unit admission (0 [0, 1]; 3 [0, 6];  p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and total hospital length of stay (5 [2, 11]; 11.5 [4, 17];  p\,=\,0.02). Two patients in the post-guideline group had delayed presentations  despite normal imaging: one with TEF and one with aorto-esophageal fistula. All  survived to discharge. CONCLUSION: In EBBI cases managed using the consensus  based NASPHAGN guidelines, we report increased resource utilization without  improved patient outcomes. Further research should evaluate post-guideline costs  and resource utilization.},

  abstract = {Deliberate foreign body ingestion (DFBI) is a rare psychopathological disorder that involves the swallowing of non-nutritive objects to cause self-harm. It is  most commonly associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Very scant  literature has been published on the psychopathological understanding or  psychopharmacological interventions. Mostly, gastroenterological and surgical  management~regarding the removal of the foreign body has been discussed in the  literature. DFBI can be very challenging in terms of the treatment of the patient  and the morale of the health providers - it exhausts the patient and the family  and evokes frustration among the medical staff due to its resistance to  remission. By presenting the case of a patient in this article, we will discuss  what is known about the poorly understood DFBI and the challenges and  difficulties encountered while treating these patients. Further, we will discuss  how a biopsychosocial approach can be used in treating these patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of wire-bristle grill brush injury. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional  analysis of national databases; literature review. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The  Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance  System (NEISS) was used to derive a national weighted estimate of emergency  department visits for wire bristle injury from 2002 to 2014. Date, location of  injury, demographics, and outcomes were analyzed. A literature search and a  consumer-reported injury database (SaferProducts.gov) were interrogated to  provide ancillary sources of data. RESULTS: A total of 43 cases were found within  the NEISS database, which extrapolated to an estimated 1698 (95\% confidence  interval, 1468-1927) emergency department visits nationwide. In the NEISS  database, the mean age was 30 years, and the sex distribution of the patients was  similar (21 males vs 22 females). The most common location of injury was the  oropharynx in both the NEISS database (23 of 43, 53.4\%) and the literature review  (11 of 36, 30.5\%). However, the oral cavity was the most frequent site in the  consumer-reported SaferProducts.gov database (9 of 24, 37.5\%). The majority of  patients in the NEISS were treated in the emergency department (31 of 43, 69.7\%).  Raw case counts were highest in June, July, and August, with the highest number  of events in the month of July. CONCLUSION: Injury from wire-bristle grill brush  is uncommon but prevalent during certain seasons. Otolaryngologists play an  important in the diagnosis and treatment of these injuries. Awareness among  consumers and product manufacturers is necessary to promote safety.},

  abstract = {Foreign body ingestion comprises a true foreign body (ie, non-food) ingestion and food bolus impaction. Foreign body ingestion is not uncommon and accounts for roughly 4\% of urgent endoscopies undertaken.1 2 True foreign body ingestion is mostly encountered in paediatric populations with 75\% of cases occurring in less than 5-year-old children.1 Coins, buttons, plastic items, batteries and bones are common culprits.3 Food bolus impaction on the other hand is mostly seen in adults, usually accidental (95\% of cases). Steakhouse syndrome, animal bones, toothpicks and fish bones are the most frequent.2 True foreign body ingestion (coins and dentures) is rare in adults. Intentional true foreign body ingestion can be seen in patients with psychiatric illness, prisoners (secondary gain) and drug dealers (`body packing'). Underlying oesophageal conditions including eosinophilic oesophagitis (10\% in adults, up to 50\% in children), motility disorder, stenosis and diverticula are frequent.2 4 Most ingested foreign bodies will pass spontaneously.5 However, 10\%--20\% require endoscopic removal, and less than 1\% require surgical extraction or treatment of a complication.6 This review focuses on the management of foreign bodies located in the upper gastrointestinal tract, in adults. The quality of evidence of the guidelines is low; however, substantial clinical experience provides strong levels of recommendation.7 8 The management of rectal foreign bodies mostly relies on surgical, transanal extraction and is not detailed herein. Precise history (type of foreign body, time of onset) is essential. Physical examination is also mandatory. Most patients are asymptomatic. Symptoms arise when the foreign body is stuck in the oesophagus or when a complication occurs (obstruction and perforation).9 Emesis, retching, blood-stained saliva, hypersialorrhoea, wheezing and/or respiratory distress in non-communicative patients (children and psychiatric patients) are suggestive of foreign body impaction.7 Oesophageal impaction (food bolus) is often symptomatic: retching, {\dots}},

Patients with foreign body ingestion typically present with odynophagia, dysphagia, sensation of having an object stuck, chest pain, and nausea/vomiting. The majority of foreign bodies pass through the digestive system spontaneously without causing any harm, symptoms, or necessitating any further intervention. A well-documented clinical history and thorough physical exam is critical in making the diagnosis, if additional modalities are needed, a CT scan and diagnostic endoscopy are generally the preferred modalities. Various tools can be used to remove foreign bodies, and endoscopic treatment is safe and effective if performed by a skilled endoscopist.},

Aims We aimed to establish more precise estimates of suicide and suicidal behavior in refugees and asylum seekers, investigate the role of somatic and psychiatric comorbidities, and the effectiveness of preventative interventions. Methods We searched PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycInfo without time limitations from inception until June 5, 2024. Studies were included if systematic reviews or meta-analyses reporting data on suicide or suicidal behavior in refugees or asylum seekers, or detailing the results of preventive interventions. Quality was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Results Out of 49 papers, 10 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included. Refugees showed significantly higher suicide death rates and suicidal ideation, suicide plan and suicide attempt prevalence compared to people living in the host countries. Refugees who arrived in low-income and lower-middle-income countries displayed lower suicidal ideation, but higher suicide death rates and suicide attempt prevalence compared to refugees who arrived in high-income and upper-middle-income countries. However, no review provided data regarding somatic comorbidity, psychiatric comorbidity, or the effectiveness of treatments, and evidence on specific categories of refugees is scarce. Conclusion Refugees have been proven to be at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. More research is required to identify the targets and procedures of intervention.},

Quite a good number of interesting and unusual cases of foreign body ingestion has been reported in the surgical literature from time to time.

Accidental ingestion of the foreign body is by far the most common. Deliberate ingestion may result from an act of insanity, a dare, a habit or medicinal therapy. Retention of elongated or pointed objects in the duodenum is a frequent problem. Long, sharp, objects may perforate the duodenum and have been known to migrate widely in the abdomen. Early removal of such objects has been advised. This case forms rarity due to the fact that the 7 inches knife remained in the Duodenum for 07 long years without causing major catastrophe.

  abstract = {Thoughout the world the number of refugees and asylum seekers continues to increase at an astonishing rate. Given that most will have left their country due to persecution, war, or appalling violations of their human rights, many will have specific mental health needs. Cultural and socioeconomic factors play a major role in expressions of distress, help seeking, pathways into care, and acceptance or rejection of treatments. Being a refugee or asylum seeker raises questions about an individual's self respect and altered identity. Too often though, the needs of this population are ignored by policy makers and clinicians, and these people are left to fend for themselves. Mental Health of Refugees and Asylum Seekers presents both the theoretical and practical aspects of the mental health needs of refugees and asylum seekers. It looks at the impact of migration on mental health and adjustment, collective trauma, individual identity, and diagnostic fallacies. A practical section highlights cultural factors, ethnopsychopharmacology, therapeutic interaction, therapeutic expectation and psychotherapy. The final part of the book focuses on special problems - such as bereavement, sexual violence, and post traumatic stress disorders, as well as considering mental health problems in special groups, such as child refugees. This book will be an essential resource for all mental health professionals- helping them better understand the needs of refugees and asylum seekers, how their problems can be managed, and how they can best be helped.},

Methods: We undertook a systematic literature review of research about self harm that compared at least two ethnic groups in the United Kingdom. Results: 25 publications from 1765 titles and abstracts met our inclusion criteria. There was higher rate of self harm among South Asian women, compared with South Asian men and White women. In a pooled estimate from two studies, compared to their white counterparts, Asian women were more likely to self harm (Relative Risk 1.4, 95\%CI: 1.1 to 1.8, p = 0.005), and Asian men were less likely to self harm (RR 0.5, 95\% CI: 0.4 to 0.7, p {$<$} 0.001). Some studies concluded that South Asian adults self-harm impulsively in response to life events rather than in association with a psychiatric illness. Studies of adolescents showed similar methods of self harm and interpersonal disputes with parents and friends across ethnic groups. There were few studies of people of Caribbean, African and other minority ethnic groups, few studies took a population based and prospective design and few investigated self harm among prisoners, asylum seekers and refugees. Conclusion: This review finds some ethnic differences in the nature and presentation of self harm. This argues for ethnic specific preventive actions. However, the literature does not comprehensively cover the UK's diverse ethnic groups.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pediatric foreign body ingestion is a common occurrence that presents a challenge both to pediatric gastroenterologists and primary care  providers. Increasing prevalence of smaller, more technologically advanced toys  in the household has resulted in an increased exposure to higher voltage  batteries and powerful magnets that carry a high incidence of morbidity and  mortality. This review highlights the latest findings regarding the patients at  risk for button battery and magnet ingestions, the symptoms of presentation, and  complications of these objects in contributing to long-standing gastrointestinal  injury. RECENT FINDINGS: Button batteries may lead to esophageal injury within a  few hours. Batteries retained in the esophagus are larger in diameter on average  and size is associated with esophageal impaction as well as higher grade  esophageal injury. Magnet ingestions, when multiple or with another metallic  object, are often initially asymptomatic but may have acute worsening, and  therefore warrant close monitoring. SUMMARY: Button battery and magnet ingestions  have increased in incidence over the past two decades. Recent literature  demonstrates that higher voltage, larger lithium button batteries, and prevalence  of high-powered magnets can lead to significant morbidity. High suspicion, early  referral, and removal may lead to improved outcomes.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Intentional and accidental foreign body ingestion are commonly encountered in clinical practice. In adults, intentional foreign body ingestion  is frequently observed among individuals with psychiatric disorders and  prisoners. Controversies exist regarding the management of sharp or pointed  objects. We contribute to this existing controversy by presenting a case of a  43-year-old male who accidently ingested a metallic screw and was managed  successfully through endoscopic retrieval. CASE PRESENTATION: We discuss a case  of a 43-year-old male presented to our emergency department after accidently  swallowing a metallic screw, 1~h and a half prior to his presentation. He was  initially asymptomatic then started to complain of vague abdominal symptoms.  X-rays of the chest and abdomen demonstrated the presence of a metallic screw at  the mid-abdomen. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen then confirmed its  presence within the gastric lumen, with no evidence of gastric or bowel  perforation. The patient was managed via esophagogastroduodenoscopy in which the  ingested screw was extracted. He was discharged after 24 hours in a good  condition. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: A limited number of epidemiological studies have  shed light on the prevalence and incidence of foreign body ingestion among adult  individuals. Probability of spontaneous passage depends on several factors  including the size, shape and composition of the impacted item, as well as the  age of patient and duration of ingestion prior to presentation. CONCLUSION:  Considering the variation of ingested objects and the availability of several  therapeutic approaches, a patient-tailored management plan should always be  established.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Foreign body (FB) ingestion is a common condition. Mostly FBs are found ingested accidently or intentionally in children and adults with mental  status alterations. Depending on the type of object, different complications can  occur. There exist numerous methods for removing each specific FB. Fortunately,  most FBs tend to move uneventfully through the gastrointestinal tract without any  intervention; but managing some foreign objects can be difficult and lead to  severe complications. Endoscopy helps with the diagnosis and treatment of these  cases, but the time of the management plays an important role. CASE PRESENTATION:  A 26-year-old female who intentionally swallowed two sewing needles, presented to  our emergency department with abdominal pain two months after the FB ingestion.  One of the sewing needles was spontaneously excreted through the bowel, and the  other was present in her body for two months. The FB had penetrated the stomach  and migrated to the peritoneal cavity. The patient's condition was managed by  laparoscopic removal of the FB and repair of the damaged tissue. According to the  traumatic nature of the needle to abdominal viscera, and standing outside the GI  tract on the pancreas surface, laparoscopic removal of the foreign metallic body  was chosen to be performed. No complication was seen during the postoperative  period. CONCLUSION: This report emphasizes the importance of prompt evaluation of  FB patients and finding the appropriate method of managing its complications.  Preventing complications requires focusing on symptoms and instant management of  the ingested FBs.},

Method: Seven English- and Sinhala-language Sri Lankan newspapers were screened for articles reporting on self-harm and suicide (December 1, 2014 to January 31, 2015). A thematic analysis was conducted. Results: In the 78 articles identified for analysis, certain aspects were overemphasized (inappropriate behavior) and others underemphasized (alcohol and complexities of self-harm). Explanations of self-harm were one-sided and a suicide prevention narrative was lacking. Limitations: Another time-frame and inclusion of Tamil newspapers as well as social media and online publications would provide additional understanding. Conclusion: The study found an indication of simplistic reporting. Greater focus on prevention and a nuanced portrayal of self-harm could reduce stigma and imitative behavior.},

Intentional overdose  of potassium supplements is an uncommon occurrence. OBJECTIVE: This case  illustrates a novel approach to treatment of pharmacobezoar with  esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and demonstrates its effectiveness in the  setting of extended-release potassium chloride overdose. CASE REPORT: A  44-year-old female presented to the ED with intentional ingestion of an unknown  amount of extended-release potassium chloride (K-Dur{\textregistered}) tablets and alprazolam  (Xanax{\textregistered}). The patient's serum potassium was initially 7.3~mmol/L and she was  treated with standard treatments, including albuterol, calcium gluconate,  insulin, dextrose, and sodium bicarbonate. Radiographic investigation showed a  pharmacobezoar in the gastric fundus. Treatment was then augmented with whole  bowel irrigation (WBI) using polyethylene glycol solution via nasogastric tube.  Patient did not tolerate the nasogastric tube, became combative with increasing  alteration in her level of consciousness, and WBI therapy was stopped. After  discussion with the gastroenterologist, the patient was treated with EGD to  remove the pharmacobezoar. The EGD was successful in the removal of the  pharmacobezoar and the~patient's potassium normalized without complications.  CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that in cases of suspected or~confirmed potassium drug  bezoar in the stomach, physicians consider EGD for removal. This allows for  normalization of potassium level while preventing adverse sequelae.},

This study defines incidence, characteristics, and management of ingestions over time. METHODS: Cases were identified by searching radiology reports from June 2002 to December 2012 at a children's hospital and verified by chart and imaging review. Relative risk (RR) regressions determined changes in incidence and interventions over time. RESULTS: In all, 98\% of ingestions occurred since 2006; 57\% involved multiple magnets. Median age was 8~years (range 0 to 18); 0\% of single and 56\% of multiple ingestions required intervention. Compared with 2007 to 2009, ingestions increased from 2010 to 2012 (RR = 1.9, 95\% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.0). Intervention proportion was unchanged (RR = .94, 95\% confidence interval .4 to 2.2). Small spherical magnets comprised 26.8\% of ingestions since 2010; 86\% involved multiple magnets and 47\% required intervention.

Various instruments were developed for this purpose (by Voltolini,  Semeleder, Stoerk, Bevan, Waldenburg, Mackenzie) which however not proved to be  effective. Mostly angled or jointed tubes came into use which were stretched  after insertion. More successful were those applying simple straight tubes.  Except for Stoerk it was Kussmaul who had a sword-swallower swallow a tube  instead of a sword. Today flexible fiberglass endoscopes are used as well as  rigid tubes.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Foreign body (FB) ingestions represent a common problem in children. History and physical examination are commonly not enough to diagnose a foreign  body ingestion; therefore, conventional radiography is routinely used to detect  them. Point-of-care ultrasound is widely used in the emergency department for  several diagnostic applications but there are few articles describing the  possibility to use point-of-care ultrasound to detect ingested foreign bodies,  and the necessary training to get competent in this application. The main  objective of this paper is to illustrate the use of point-of-care ultrasound  (POCUS) to detect ingested foreign bodies. The secondary objective is to describe  a limited training, necessary for emergency pediatricians, to obtain this skill.  METHODS: This is a case series of eight pediatric patients who presented to the  pediatric Emergency Department (ED), with suspected ingestion of FB, and were  assessed with POCUS. Physician sonographers were two pediatricians and three  residents in pediatrics working in two Italian Pediatric EDs. All sonographers  participated in a 2-day POCUS workshop which included the most common pediatric  POCUS applications. RESULTS: POCUS, performed by emergency pediatricians who  participated to a limited training, allowed to always identify the foreign bodies  ingested. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that an appropriate and limited training  allows pediatric emergency physicians to correctly identify foreign body in the  esophagus or stomach. Point-of-care ultrasound in foreign body ingestion in the  Emergency Department may allow to prioritize the escalation of care in children  and it can contribute to reduce the time to endoscopic management when needed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Harmfulness of foreign body ingestion and food bolus impaction (FBIs) varies according to geographical area, population, habits, and diet. Therefore,  studies may not draw generalizable conclusions. Furthermore, data regarding FBIs  management in Europe are limited and outdated. This study aimed to analyze the  endoscopic management and outcomes of FBIs in an Italian tertiary care hospital  to identify risk factors for endoscopic failure. METHODS: We retrospectively  reviewed patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for FBIs between  2007 and 2017. Baseline, clinical, FBIs, and endoscopic characteristics and  outcomes were collected and reported using descriptive statistics and logistic  regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 381 endoscopies for FBIs, 288 (75.5\%) were  emergent endoscopy and 135 (35,4\%) included underlying upper gastrointestinal  conditions. The study population included 44 pediatric patients (11.5\%), 54  prisoners (15.8\%), and 283 adults (74.2\%). The most common type and location of  FBIs were food boluses (52.9\%) and upper esophagus (36.5\%), respectively. While  eight patients (2.1\%) developed major adverse events requiring hospital  admission, the remainder (97.9\%) were discharged after observation. No mortality  occurred. Endoscopic success was achieved in 263 of 286 (91.9\%) verified FBIs  endoscopies. Endoscopic failure (8.04\%) was associated with age, bone, disk  battery, intentional ingestion, razor blade, prisoners, and stomach in the  univariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that intentional  ingestion was associated with endoscopic failure (odds ratio: 7.31; 95\%  confidence interval\>=\>2.06-25.99; P \>=\>0.002). CONCLUSION: Endoscopy for FBIs is  safe and successful, with low hospital admission rate in children, prisoners, and  adults. Intentional ingestion is a risk factor of endoscopic failure.},

These foreign bodies can be classified under two major groups: the ones that are inserted from  the anus and the ones that are swallowed and thereafter become stuck in the  rectum. METHODS: Data of patients admitted with a foreign body in the rectum  between 1988 and 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 30 patients were  reviewed. RESULTS: The most common reason for a foreign body in the rectum was  insertion for erotic purposes, which was seen in 19 of the 30 patients. All these  patients were male. The remaining 11 patients reported nonerotic causes. The most  efficient and implemented therapeutic method was simple extraction during the  first examination. CONCLUSIONS: The most common reason for a foreign body in the  rectum is insertion for erotic purposes. The first target of therapy should be  extraction of the foreign body using the simplest method possible. Meanwhile,  protecting the integrity of the intestine is of the utmost importance. The care  for maintaining the integrity of the rectum should include an evaluation of the  patient's psychological status.},

METHODS: Retrospective review of patients treated for esophageal  coin ingestion at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin over a 1-year period using  bougienage or endoscopic retrieval was conducted. (inclusion criterion) RESULTS:  Twenty-seven patients were evaluated over the 1-year study period. Two patients  spontaneously passed the coins before arrival and needed no further treatment.  Twelve patients met criteria for bougienage, and this treatment was successful in  10 of the 12 patients. Mean length of hospital stay was 2.15 hours, and the mean  cost was \$546. Thirteen patients were treated successfully with endoscopy. The  mean length of hospital stay was 22.7 hours, and the mean cost was \$5,230. There  were no complications in any of the 25 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Bougienage is  equally safe, more efficient, and much less expensive than endoscopy for  treatment of esophageal coins in properly selected patients. Nearly half of the  patients were excluded from bougienage because of delayed presentation alone.  Education of parents and physicians regarding symptoms of coin ingestion would  allow primary treatment with bougienage in the majority of cases.},

Laboratory blood count reported  leukocytosis and alteration of principal inflammation index; at the abdominal  ultrasound no signs of perforation or collection were described. DISCUSSION:  Indication to surgery was posed and an explorative laparoscopy was performed. The  presence of local peritonitis at the right colonic flexure secondary to a full  thickness bowel perforation caused by a toothpick was found. There was also an  acute phlegmonous appendicitis. A laparoscopic appendectomy and a full-thickness  double running suture of the perforation were performed. CONCLUSION: Awareness  about dangers of ingested toothpicks needs to be taken and the intestinal  track/trace of the toothpick is mandatory until its expulsion.},

Foreign body injury (FBI) most commonly occurs in children younger than 6 years, and the incidence of FBI has increased in recent years. The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the characteristics of FBI due to ingestion and aspiration. METHODS: Data from patients who were hospitalized for FB ingestion and/or aspiration and underwent rigid bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy from 2008 to 2011 were retrospectively evaluated. Foreign body in the upper aerodigestive tract was evaluated with respect to the characteristics of patients, clinical presentation, management strategy, the outcome, and features of FB. RESULTS: A total of 192 patients admitted for FB ingestion or aspiration in the pediatric surgery department were evaluated. The mean age was 40.97 (SD, 35.73) months. The majority of patients were younger than 4 years. Foreign bodies were mainly located in the upper esophagus for ingested FBs (60.8\%), whereas for aspiration 43\% of FBs were in the main right bronchus. A total of 4 patients died. The hospitalization period of patients admitted for FB aspiration was longer than that of patients with FB ingestion. Surgery was performed in 4 patients. The most commonly ingested FBs were coins, whereas seeds were the most commonly aspirated. CONCLUSION: Prevention is the key to dealing with FBIs. Because the frequency of foreign bodies is higher in underdeveloped countries, education of parents regarding the dangers and prevention of aspiration and ingestion is important.},

She had abdominal tenderness and defense on the physical examination. Abdominal X-ray showed air and fluid levels. Metallic images were not considered at first as important in the diagnosis. Abdominal ultrasonography was reported as acute appendicitis. During the abdominal exploration, the appendix was normal, but there were dense adherences around the ileum and cecum. After adhesiolysis, intestinal perforations were seen in the cecum and 15 and 45 cm proximal to the cecum. Magnet and metal pieces were present in the perforated segments. Wedge resection and primary repair was performed. There were no postoperative complications, and she was discharged on the postoperative fifth day. Pediatric surgeons should be aware of the complications of multiple magnet ingestion.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis over 12~years was conducted of 45 cases of  buried fish bones in the surrounding tissue of upper gastrointestinal tract with  complications. Meanwhile, a control group, including 39 cases of prolonged buried  fish bones in the surrounding tissue of upper gastrointestinal tract without  complications, was set. Patient clinical data were collected and analyzed to  predict the risk factors for complications. RESULTS: The results of Chi-square  test and univariate analysis both showed a significant difference in length of  fish bone ({$>$}\,2~cm), a history of concurrent medical illness (diabetes mellitus  and renal hypofunction), symptoms (medium or heavy pain and dysphagia), and  duration of significant symptoms ({$>$}\,7 days) between the complication group and  non-complication group. Multivariate analysis further identified length ({$>$}\,2~cm),  diabetes mellitus, medium or heavy pain, dysphagia, and duration of significant  symptoms ({$>$}\,7 days) as independent risk factors for complications. CONCLUSIONS:  The consequences of fish bones migrating outside the upper gastrointestinal tract  are various in different people. Awareness should be raised when encountering a  patient ingesting a long fish bone, having a history of diabetes mellitus,  presenting with significant discomforts, or these discomforts lasting for a long  time.

  abstract = {Background and aims.- Introduction.- Intentional foreign body ingestion occurs among a relatively small number of patients with psychiatric disorders; however, it is potentially very harmful and costly. Literature is remarkably sparse, with discussions of associated psychiatric symptoms and treatments limited. Most reports on intentional swallowing are found in the surgical and gastroenterological literature. They contain little to no commentary about patient intentions, or psychopathology. Self-injurious behavior is a fairly common phenomenon in psychiatric patients, particularly those with severe personality disorders. Objectives.- We aim to help characterize the association between foreign body ingestion and psychiatric disorders by presenting a case report of a young man with borderline personality disorder and polysubstance use, who repeatedly swallowed pieces of glass as a form of self-injury. Methods.- Case report: 37-year-old Caucasian male who was admitted for a fourth time after ingesting a foreign body in the context of suicidal ideation. The patient has a past psychiatry history of mood disorder, borderline personality disorder, and polysubstance use. His history is notable for multiple ED visits after ingesting broken glass, resulting in multiple endoscopic procedures (28 pieces of glass removed by colonoscopy). Results.- Repetitive foreign body ingestion is often impulsively driven and difficult to treat. As such, it results in frequent yet ineffective medical treatment. Morbidity from the ingestion itself and the procedures to remove the foreign bodies lends itself to an elevated financial burden for the health care system. Conclusions.- Understanding behavioral factors is critical for developing collaborative treatment strategies for patients suffering from this life threatening, self-injurious condition.},

METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 159 adult patients with confirmed diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal FBs who received endoscopic management in the emergency department. RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 57.0 {\textpm} 19.2 years, and 66 (37.7\%) of the patients were 65 years or older. Majority had a clear history and symptoms of FB ingestion. However, 9 (5.7\%) initially ignored the accidental swallowing of FBs and were diagnosed late. The mean time spent for diagnosis was 1.8 days in those with uncertain history. Only 47.1\% of those with radiographic studies had positive findings. Fish bones, press-through package and dentures were the most common culprits in this population of Asian elderly. Majority of FBs were located in the esophagus, especially in the upper third. Endoscopic FB extraction was successful in 96.9\% of cases, while surgery was required in only 5 patients. The complication rate was 6.9\%, including mucosal laceration (n = 10) and suspected perforation (n = 1), all of which were successfully managed conservatively. There was no death due to FB ingestion or endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: In FB ingestion, history usually points toward the diagnosis. Patients with an uncertain history are usually diagnosed late, and plain radiography cannot reliably predict the presence of FB. Endoscopic management is safe and effective for FBs.},

Pediatric emergency physicians and gastroenterologists often  encounter nervous and distressed situations, because of children presenting with  this condition in the common clinical practice. When determining the appropriate  timing and indications for intervention, physicians should consider multiple  patient- and FB-related factors. The utilization of a flexible endoscopy is  considered safe and effective to use in these cases, with a high success rate,  for the effective extraction of FBs from the gastrointestinal tract of a child.  Additionally, a Foley catheter and a magnet-attached Levin tube have been used  for decades in the case of FB removal. Although their use has decreased  significantly in recent times, these instruments continue to be used for several  indications. Using a Foley catheter for this purpose does not require special  training and does not necessarily require sedation of the patient or fluoroscopy,  which serve as advantages of utilizing this method for foreign object retrieval.  An ingested magnet or iron-containing FB can be retrieved using a magnet-attached  tube, and can be effective to retrieve an object from any section of the upper  gastrointestinal tract that can be reached. Simple and inexpensive devices such  as Foley catheters and magnet-attached tubes can be used in emergencies such as  with the esophageal impaction of disk batteries if endoscopy cannot be performed  immediately (e.g., in rural areas and/or in patients presenting at midnight in a  facility, especially in those without access to endoscopes or emergency services,  or in any situation that warrants urgent removal of a foreign object).},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen expandable covered metallic stents  were placed with fluoroscopic guidance in 16 patients (14 men, two women; mean  age, 60 years; age range, 26-75 years) with malignant and benign strictures of  the cervical esophagus. The causes of strictures were ingestion of corrosive  agents (n = 3), biopsy-proved squamous cell carcinoma (n = 12), and postsurgical  scarring (n = 1). The mean dysphagia scores at presentation were compared with  those after stent placement by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS:  Stent placement was technically successful in all patients. The reduction in the  mean dysphagia score after stent placement was statistically significant (P =  .0327). All patients complained of mild to severe foreign body sensation, with  four reporting severe pain necessitating immediate stent removal. With the  exception of one patient with limited follow-up, complications requiring  intervention occurred in all patients, including migration in nine patients and  tissue hyperproliferation in two. Of the 12 patients with a malignant stricture  of the esophagus, four patients eventually underwent gastrostomy for the  placement of a feeding tube and one patient underwent surgery. All four patients  with a benign cervical stricture failed to achieve long-lasting improvement with  temporary stent placement. CONCLUSIONS: Although the placement of covered  metallic stents in the cervical esophagus provides adequate initial palliation,  it is associated with poor patient tolerance and a high complication rate.},

We report a case of  meat bolus with cartilaginous component impacted in the cervical esophagus, with  a brief literature review. CASE REPORT A 64-year-old man came to our attention  for retention in the cervical esophagus of a piece of meat accidentally swallowed  during lunch. After a few attempts of endoscopic removal carried out previously  in other hospitals, the patient has been treated by us with a cervical  esophagotomy and removal of the foreign body, without any complications. We  checked the database of PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library from January  2007 to January 2017 in order to verify the presence of randomized controlled  trials, clinical trials, retrospective studies, and case series regarding the use  of the cervical esophagotomy for the extraction of foreign bodies impacted in the  esophagus. CONCLUSIONS The crucial point is to differentiate the cases that must  be immediately treated from those requiring simple observation. Endoscopic  treatment is definitely the first therapeutic option, but in case of failure of  this approach, in our opinion, cervical esophagotomy could be a safe, easy,  viable, durable approach for the extraction of foreign bodies impacted in the  cervical esophagus. Our review does not have the purpose of providing definitive  conclusions but is intended to represent a starting point for subsequent studies.},

This condition is  generally observed in patients with limited consciousness or attention, such as  children, elders, or psychiatric patients. Here, we report a case of intestinal  perforation caused by ingestion of a foreign body that occurred during the  performance of a contrast-enhanced CT scan. CASE REPORT A 73-year-old diabetic  woman was admitted to the emergency room of our hospital with postprandial  abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Under the suspicion of bowel  ischemia, the patient underwent a contrast-enhanced CT scan. A thickened ileal  loop with an endoluminal bone-density foreign body was detected. The following  contrast-enhanced acquisitions additionally showed air bubbles adjacent to the  loop, as the sign of an intestinal perforation that occurred between the basal  and the contrast-enhanced acquisitions. CONCLUSIONS Caution should be always  exercised in patients with suspected gastrointestinal perforation, especially if  caused by ingested foreign bodies. A high degree of suspicion and a CT scan may  prevent delays in the diagnosis and clinical management of these patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A pictorial review of colorectal foreign bodies and their extraction. METHODS: A prospective data-base and photographic record of patients who presented with retained colorectal foreign bodies at our institution has been maintained since 1995. Information regarding the foreign body, clinical presentation and extraction technique were documented. RESULTS: All 13 patients were male: age range 2-66 years. Seven were Caucasian, 4 African and 1 Asian. The foreign bodies included a penknife, an aerosol deodorant spray can, a blue plastic tumbler, a plastic bag containing two bank-notes and some marijuana, a plastic packet containing fish hooks, a penlight torch, a broomstick, a battery powered vibrator, a primus stove, a cap of an aerosol can, a piece of wire, a piece of hosepipe wrapped with wire and an iron bar. They entered the alimentary tract for a variety of reasons; anal autoeroticism (3), concealment (2), attention seeking behaviour (3), accidental (1), assault (2) and to alleviate constipation (2). Plain radiographs accurately demonstrated the site of the foreign body in 8 patients. Extraction was at laparotomy in 2 patients with peritonitis and in 3 who required extraction by colotomy. In 7 patients who had transanal extraction, four required general anaesthesia to facilitate extraction and extraction was possible under conscious sedation in the emergency room in three. The remaining patient extracted the foreign body himself and presented to hospital with a rectal perforation. CONCLUSION: The emergency room physician must confirm the presence of a rectal foreign body. Extraction in the emergency room is usually not possible and patient's with retained rectal foreign bodies should be referred to a colorectal surgeon.},

  abstract = {Background Refugees, and other forcibly displaced people, face mental distress and may be disproportionately affected by risk factors for suicide. Little is known about suicidal behaviour in these highly mobile populations because collecting timely, relevant, and reliable data is challenging. Methods and findings A systematic review was performed to identify studies of any design reporting on suicide, suicide attempts, or suicidal ideation among populations of displaced people. A sensitive electronic database search was performed in August 2020, and all retrieved studies were screened for relevance by two authors. Studies were categorised by the population being evaluated: refugees granted asylum, refugees living in temporary camps, asylum seekers, or internally displaced people. We distinguished between whether the sampling procedure in the studies was likely to be representative, or the sample examined a specific non-representative subgroup of displaced people (such as those already diagnosed with mental illness). Data on the rates of suicide or the prevalence of suicide attempts or suicidal ideation were extracted by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer from each study and converted to common metrics. After screening 4347 articles, 87 reports of 77 unique studies were included. Of these, 53 were studies in representative samples, and 24 were based on samples of specific target populations. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries, and the most studied population subgroup was refugees granted asylum. There was substantial heterogeneity across data sources and measurement instruments utilised. Sample sizes of displaced people ranged from 33 to 196,941 in studies using general samples. Suicide rates varied considerably, from 4 to 290 per 100,000 person-years across studies. Only 8 studies were identified that compared suicide rates with the host population. The prevalence of suicide attempts ranged from 0.14\% to 15.1\% across all studies and varied according to the prevalence period evaluated. Suicidal ideation prevalence varied from 0.17\% to 70.6\% across studies. Among refugees granted asylum, there was evidence of a lower risk of suicide compared with the host population in 4 of 5 studies. In contrast, in asylum seekers there was evidence of a higher suicide risk in 2 of 3 studies, and of a higher risk of suicidal ideation among refugees living in camps in 2 of 3 studies compared to host populations. Conclusion While multiple studies overall have been published in the literature on this topic, the evidence base is still sparse for refugees in camps, asylum seekers, and internally displaced people. Less than half of the included studies reported on suicide or suicide attempt outcomes, with most reporting on suicidal ideation. International research networks could usefully define criteria, definitions, and study designs to help standardise and facilitate more research in this important area.

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM) complicates approximately 2\% of pregnancies and can be either spontaneous or iatrogenic in nature. Complications of PPROM include prematurity, chorioamnionitis, neonatal sepsis, limb position defects, respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary hypoplasia chronic lung disease, periventricular leukomalacia and intraventricular haemorrhage. A number of different sealing techniques have been employed which aim to restore a physical barrier against infection and encourage the re-accumulation of amniotic fluid. Routine use of sealants is currently not recommended due to a lack of sufficient evidence to support the safety and effectiveness of such interventions. Objectives To assess the effects of sealing techniques following PPROM against each other, or versus standard care (including no sealant), on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 May 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different techniques for sealing preterm prelabour ruptured membranes. Cluster-randomised trials and trials using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion in this review. We planned to include abstracts when sufficient information was provided. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed trial quality. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. Main results We included two studies (involving 141 women - with data from 124 women). We considered both studies as being at high risk of bias. Meta-analysis was not possible because the included studies examined different interventions (both in comparison with standard care) and reported on few, but different, outcomes. One study compared cervical adapter (mechanical sealing), and the other study examined an immunological membrane sealant. Neither of the included studies reported on this review's primary outcome of interest - perinatal mortality. Similarly, data were not reported for the majority of this review's secondary infant and maternal outcomes. Cervical adapter (mechanical sealing) versus standard care (one study, data from 35 participants) No data were reported for this review's primary outcome -  perinatal mortality . Data were reported for few of this review's infant or maternal secondary outcomes. There was no clear difference between the mechanical sealing group and the standard care control in relation to the incidence of  neonatal sepsis  (risk ratio (RR) 1.19, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 5.09 ( very low-quality evidence )) or  chorioamnionitis  (RR 1.19, 95\% CI 0.28 to 5.09 ( very low-quality evidence )). Oral immunological membrane sealant versus standard care (one study, data from 94 participants) No data were available for  perinatal mortality  (this review's primary outcome) or for the majority of this review's infant and maternal secondary outcomes. Compared to standard care, the immunological membrane sealant was associated with a reduction in  preterm birth less than 37 weeks  (RR 0.48, 95\% CI 0.34 to 0.68 ( very low-quality evidence )) and a reduction in  neonatal death  (RR 0.38, 95\% CI 0.19 to 0.75 ( very low-quality evidence) ). However, there was no clear difference between groups in terms of  neonatal sepsis  (RR 0.64, 95\% CI 0.28 to 1.46 ( very low-quality evidence )) or  respiratory distress syndrome  (RR 0.64, 95\% CI 0.28 to 1.46 ( very low-quality evidence )). Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to evaluate sealing procedures for PPROM. There were no data relating to this review's primary outcome (perinatal mortality) and the majority of our infant and maternal secondary outcomes were not reported in the two included studies. There was limited evidence to suggest that an immunological membrane sealant was associated with a reduction in preterm birth at less than 37 weeks and neonatal death, but these results should be interpreted with caution as this is based on one small study, with a high risk of bias, and the intervention has not been tested in other studies. Although midtrimester PPROM is not a rare occurrence, there are only a small amount of published data addressing the benefits and risks of sealing procedures. Most of these studies are retrospective and cohort based and could therefore not be included in our data-analysis. This review highlights the paucity of prospective randomised trials in this area. Current evidence provides limited information both on effectiveness and safety for the interventions described. Given the paucity of high-quality data, we recommend that future research efforts focus on the conduct of randomised trials assessing the effect of promising interventions that have been only evaluated to date in cohort studies (e.g. amniopatch). Future trials should address outcomes including perinatal mortality, preterm birth, neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal sepsis and developmental delay. They should also evaluate maternal outcomes including sepsis, mode of delivery, length of hospital stay and emotional well-being. Plain language summary Treatments for improving outcomes for mother and baby when the waters have broken too early What is the issue? Preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM) is when the waters break at less than 37 weeks' gestation. It occurs in one in 50 pregnancies and can happen spontaneously or after a medical procedure has been performed, for example, tests where a needle is placed in to the womb to get a sample of fluid or tissue, or after an operation has been performed on the baby inside the womb. Why is this important? Breaking of the waters early in pregnancy can lead to significant problems including the baby being born too soon to survive, having immature lungs, and serious infections. Preterm babies are overall more likely to be ill and to suffer from long-term disabilities, if they do survive. The survival of babies affected by PPROM is related to how early it occurs in the pregnancy and if an infection occurs. In some circumstances, the waters may reseal themselves. This is more likely to occur when no infection is present. Several treatments to reseal the membranes have been tried, with varying success. Resealing has been attempted by: a) injecting clotting factors and other medicines in to the hole in the womb to create a patch over the area that is leaking; b) taking tablets that may stimulate the body's immune system to mend the area where the seal has broken; c) placing a sponge over the hole in the waters; d) placing a seal over the neck of the womb to stop fluid leaking out and prevent infection. Our study is important because finding a successful treatment for PPROM may reduce the potential complications that may happen to the mother and baby such as preterm birth (being born before 37 weeks' gestation) and infections. What did we find? In our study we assessed the different techniques used for resealing the waters. We aimed to compare the survival of babies affected with this condition before and after birth and look at the rates of complications in both the babies and mothers. We searched for trials (30 May 2016) and found two studies that compared treatments for resealing the membranes after they had broken. These trials involved 141 women in total and compared two completely different modes of treatment. One trial compared the use of an oral immunological membrane sealant to stimulate the body's immune system to mend the area where the seal has broken and the other trial placed a mechanical sealing device over the cervix (neck of the womb) to stop fluid leaking. Unfortunately, neither trial provided any data relating to death of the baby within the womb or in the first 28 days of life (perinatal mortality). There was limited evidence to suggest that oral immunological membrane sealant was associated with a fewer babies being before 37 weeks' gestation and a reduction in the number of babies that died within the first 28 days. However, these results are based on  very low-quality evidence  from one small trial (with data from 94 women) that we judged to be at a high risk of bias. There was no clear difference between the mechanical sealing device group and the control group in relation to the number of babies who contracted a serious infection (neonatal sepsis) or chorioamnionitis (a bacterial infection that causes inflammation of the membranes surrounding the baby in the womb). Although these results are based on  very low-quality evidence  from one small trial (involving 35 women) judged to be at a high risk of bias. What does this mean? Overall, our question remains unanswered - we do not have enough data to fully evaluate sealing procedures for PPROM. This review demonstrates the lack of research in this area regarding the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments for PPROM. We recommend that more research is needed to look at the different techniques for sealing broken waters and that this research should focus on the effectiveness of the treatment in improving overall outcomes. The safety of the treatments to both mother and baby must be further evaluated before sealing techniques can be recommended to prevent adverse outcomes.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Foreign body ingestion is a common clinical presentation with less than 1\% of the cases requiring surgical intervention. In this report, we present  a rare case of razor blades lodged in the appendix as a result of intentional  ingestion. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 25\,year old male prisoner presented to our  hospital with persistent right iliac fossa pain after razor blade ingestion.  After 5\,days of conservative management, there was no sign of transition on  serial X-Rays. Laparoscopy with intraoperative image intensification confirmed  the presence of the razor blades in the appendix and appendicectomy was  subsequently performed without complications. DISCUSSION: Most ingested objected  with diameter less than 2.5\,cm and length less than 6\,cm can pass through the  gastrointestinal tract spontaneously in less than one week. The entry of foreign  objects into the appendix is thought to be due to relative low motility of the  caecum, the dependent position of the appendix and the size of the appendiceal  orifice. Radiographic localisation to the appendiceal lumen was complicated by  metallic artefact, but was consistent with failure to transit. Appendicectomy was  felt to be the safest mode of retrieval. CONCLUSION: Ingested foreign body lodged  in the appendix is a rare event. Once the exact location is confirmed, a simple  laparoscopic appendicectomy can be performed to facilitate the removal.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Foreign body ingestion is a common pediatric problem. Coins are by far the most common ingested foreign bodies. When ingested coins become lodged in  the esophagus, they may cause serious complications if they are not removed in a  timely manner. Endoscopic removal is the preferred treatment in many pediatric  centers as its safety and effectiveness are well established. OBJECTIVES: We  performed this study to evaluate safety and effectiveness of an alternative  method of managing esophageal coins, using bougienage technique. METHODS:  Previously healthy children presenting to the local emergency room with  uncomplicated, witnessed coin ingestion of less than 24 hours duration were  prospectively recruited with an intent-to-treat analysis. A single oral passage  of a Hurst bougie dilator was performed by a gastroenterologist to dislodge the  esophageal coin into the stomach. If bougienage was successful (x-ray showing  coin in the stomach), patients were discharged and instructions were given for  monitoring stools until passage of the coin through anus was confirmed. If  bougienage was unsuccessful, the child developed symptoms at any time or if a  coin remained intragastric for 4 weeks, endoscopic removal was planned. Children  whose parents declined to participate in the bougienage treatment received the  standard endoscopic removal and their hospital records were used as controls.  RESULTS: A total of 10 children were enrolled in this study, with a mean age of  3.2 years (11 mo to 10 y), 6 boys and 4 girls. All received little or no  sedation. Nine children (90\%) were successfully treated using bougienage, all of  whom spontaneously passed the ingested coins, with a mean duration of 2.6 days (1  to 7 d) without subsequent intervention. A single case failed bougienage and  underwent endoscopic removal. Three children declined bougienage treatment and  underwent endoscopic removal. There were no reported minor or major adverse  events with any of our cases. The mean health care cost for the hospital visit  for bougienage treatment was \$1210, compared with \$3100 for the endoscopic  removal (P{$<$}0.001). Furthermore, the mean time spent in the hospital from  diagnosis to discharge was 2 hours for bougienage-treated patients compared with  8 hours for endoscopic treatment (P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bougienage of impacted  esophageal coins is an effective, safe, and more economic treatment modality for  selected pediatric patients with uncomplicated coin ingestion. This simple  technique may provide a valuable tool to emergency room physicians or primary  care doctors especially when endoscopy is not readily available.},

  abstract = {Background: Intentional ingestion of foreign objects (IIFO) is common in the incarcerated population. This study was undertaken in order to better define clinical patterns of IIFO among prisoners. We sought to determine factors associated with the need for endoscopic and surgical therapy for IIFO. Methods: After obtaining permission to conduct IIFO research in incarcerated populations, study patients were identified by ICD-9 codes. Patient charts were reviewed for demographics; past medical history; IIFO characteristics; and diagnostic, endoscopic, and surgical findings. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using statistical software. Results: Thirty patients with 141 episodes of IIFO were identified. The mean number of ingested items per episode was 4.60. Endoscopy was performed in 97 of 141 IIFO instances, with failure to retrieve the ingested object in 21 of 97 cases (22\%). Eleven instances (7.8\%) required surgical intervention. On multivariate analyses, hospital admission was associated with elevated white blood cell count (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, P {$<$} 0.05) and number of items ingested (OR 1.3, P {$<$} 0.05). The need for endoscopy was independently associated with ingestion of multiple objects (OR 3.3, P {$<$} 0.05) and elevated white blood cell count (OR 1.3, P {$<$} 0.05). Surgical therapy was significantly associated with elevated white blood cell count (OR 1.6, P {$<$} 0.01) and with increasing number of ingested items (OR 1.07 per item, P {$<$} 0.05). Endoscopy is associated with significantly lower odds of surgery (OR 0.13, P {$<$} 0.01). Conclusions: Intentional ingestion of foreign objects continues to pose a significant human and economic burden. The need for admission or therapy is frequently associated with leukocytosis. Further investigation is warranted into resource-appropriate triage of patients who present with IIFO.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Alveolar osteitis (dry socket) is a complication of dental extractions more often involving mandibular molar teeth. It is associated with severe pain developing 2 to 3 days postoperatively with or without halitosis, a socket that may be partially or totally devoid of a blood clot, and increased postoperative visits. This is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2012.  Objectives To assess the effects of local interventions used for the prevention and treatment of alveolar osteitis (dry socket) following tooth extraction. Search methods An Information Specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 28 September 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of adults over 18 years of age who were having permanent teeth extracted or who had developed dry socket postextraction. We included studies with any type of local intervention used for the prevention or treatment of dry socket, compared to a different local intervention, placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies reporting on systemic use of antibiotics or the use of surgical techniques because these interventions are evaluated in separate Cochrane Reviews. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We followed Cochrane statistical guidelines and reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and calculated 95\% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects models. For some of the split-mouth studies with sparse data, it was not possible to calculate RR so we calculated the exact odds ratio (OR) instead. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the body of evidence. Main results We included 49 trials with 6771 participants; 39 trials (with 6219 participants) investigated prevention of dry socket and 10 studies (with 552 participants) looked at the treatment of dry socket. 16 studies were at high risk of bias, 30 studies at unclear risk of bias, and 3 studies at low risk of bias. Chlorhexidine in the prevention of dry socket When compared to placebo, rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthrinses (0.12\% and 0.2\% concentrations) both before and 24 hours after extraction(s) substantially reduced the risk of developing dry socket with an OR of 0.38 (95\% CI 0.25 to 0.58; P {$<$} 0.00001; 6 trials, 1547 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The prevalence of dry socket varies from 1\% to 5\% in routine dental extractions to upwards of 30\% in surgically extracted third molars. The number of patients needed to be treated (NNT) with chlorhexidine rinse to prevent one patient having dry socket was 162 (95\% CI 155 to 240), 33 (95\% CI 27 to 49), and 7 (95\% CI 5 to 10) for control prevalence of dry socket 0.01, 0.05, and 0.30 respectively.  Compared to placebo, placing chlorhexidine gel intrasocket after extractions reduced the odds of developing a dry socket by 58\% with an OR of 0.44 (95\% CI 0.27 to 0.71; P = 0.0008; 7 trials, 753 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The NNT with chlorhexidine gel (0.2\%) to prevent one patient developing dry socket was 180 (95\% CI 137 to 347), 37 (95\% CI 28 to 72), and 7 (95\% CI 5 to 15) for control prevalence of dry socket of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.30 respectively. Compared to chlorhexidine rinse (0.12\%), placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2\%) intrasocket after extractions was not superior in reducing the risk of dry socket (RR 0.74, 95\% CI 0.46 to 1.20; P = 0.22; 2 trials, 383 participants; low-certainty evidence).  The present review found some evidence for the association of minor adverse reactions with use of 0.12\%, 0.2\% chlorhexidine mouthrinses (alteration in taste, staining of teeth, stomatitis) though most studies were not designed explicitly to detect the presence of hypersensitivity reactions to mouthwash as part of the study protocol. No adverse events were reported in relation to the use of 0.2\% chlorhexidine gel placed directly into a socket. Platelet rich plasma in the prevention of dry socket  Compared to placebo, placing platelet rich plasma after extractions was not superior in reducing the risk of having a dry socket (RR 0.51, 95\% CI 0.19 to 1.33; P = 0.17; 2 studies, 127 participants; very low-certainty evidence).  A further 21 intrasocket interventions to prevent dry socket were each evaluated in single studies, and there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects. Zinc oxide eugenol versus Alvogyl in the treatment of dry socket Two studies, with 80 participants, showed that Alvogyl (old formulation) is more effective than zinc oxide eugenol at reducing pain at day 7 (mean difference (MD) -1.40, 95\% CI -1.75 to -1.04; P {$<$} 0.00001; 2 studies, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence) A further nine interventions for the treatment of dry socket were evaluated in single studies, providing insufficient evidence to determine their effects. Authors' conclusions Tooth extractions are generally undertaken by dentists for a variety of reasons, however, all but five studies included in the present review included participants undergoing extraction of third molars, most of which were undertaken by oral surgeons. There is moderate-certainty evidence that rinsing with chlorhexidine (0.12\% and 0.2\%) or placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2\%) in the sockets of extracted teeth, probably results in a reduction in dry socket. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of the other 21 preventative interventions each evaluated in single studies. There was limited evidence of very low certainty that Alvogyl (old formulation) may reduce pain at day 7 in patients with dry socket when compared to zinc oxide eugenol.  Plain language summary What treatments can be used to prevent and treat alveolar osteitis (dry socket)?  Key messages - Rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthwash before a dental extraction or beginning 24 hours after may help to prevent a dry socket. - Placing a chlorhexidine gel directly into the socket immediately after tooth extraction may help to prevent a dry socket. - Chlorhexidine rinses cause some minor adverse (unwanted) effects; chlorhexidine intrasocket gels do not appear to cause adverse effects. - Alvogyl reduces the pain of a dry socket when compared to zinc oxide eugenol, but the evidence for this is very uncertain. - Alvogyl does not appear to cause unwanted effects. - We need future studies to strengthen the evidence and investigate the best ways to prevent and treat dry socket in all teeth. What is dry socket? Dry socket is a painful condition that sometimes arises after a tooth has been extracted and is more likely to occur following extraction of wisdom teeth in the lower jaw. What causes dry socket? It is thought to be linked to the loss of some or all of the blood clot that forms at the bottom of a tooth socket after a tooth is taken out. How can we prevent dry socket? An option for prevention of dry socket is to reduce debris and the bacterial load in the mouth, though dry socket is not bacterial in origin. People with poor oral hygiene (food debris and plaque) are at greater risk of dry socket. Improved oral hygiene and rinsing before a dental extraction or beginning 24 hours after may reduce the likelihood of dry socket. How can we treat dry socket ? Options for treating dry socket largely focus on reducing pain locally around the tooth extraction site by placing an obtundent (a soothing medicated dressing). What did we want to find out ? We wanted to find out if antiseptic rinses, gels, or healing patches could help to prevent dry socket. We also wanted to find out if placing a medicated dressing could treat a dry socket and whether any unwanted side effects were produced. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared antiseptic rinses or intrasocket gels with a placebo (dummy) rinse or nothing and a placebo (dummy) intrasocket gel or nothing. To find the best way to treat dry socket we searched for studies that compared different soothing agents with a placebo (dummy) with other soothing agents or with nothing. We compared the results of the studies and summarised the findings. We made an assessment of our confidence in the evidence based on the design of the study and the number of patients recruited. What did we find? We identified 49 trials; 39 trials (6219 participants) investigated prevention of dry socket and 10 trials (552 participants) investigated the treatment of dry socket. We found that: - rinsing both before and after tooth extraction (commencing 24 hours after extraction) with chlorhexidine gluconate rinse (at 0.12\% and 0.2\% strength) probably results in a reduction in dry socket; - placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2\% strength) in the socket of an extracted tooth probably results in a reduction in dry socket; - chlorhexidine rinses and gels are equally effective at reducing dry socket, but the evidence for this comparison is very uncertain; - chlorhexidine rinses produced some minor unwanted effects; chlorhexidine intrasocket gels appeared to produce no unwanted effects; - there was a small amount of evidence of very low certainty from two studies that Alvogyl (old formulation) may reduce pain at day 7 in patients with dry socket when compared to zinc oxide eugenol. This evidence relates to the old formulation of Alvogyl which is no longer available. It should be noted that the formulation of Alvogyl has changed, it is now called Alveogyl.  Tooth extractions are generally undertaken by dentists for a variety of reasons, however, all but five studies included in the present review included participants undergoing extraction of third molars, most of which were undertaken by oral surgeons.  What are the limitations of the evidence? The main limitation of the evidence are that studies: - reported mostly on tooth extractions involving lower wisdom teeth; - were undertaken in ways that introduced errors in the conduct of the study leading to errors in the results; and - produced imprecise results when they were combined. Due to these errors we have some confidence in the results relating to chlorhexidine rinses and gels but further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. How up to date is this evidence? The search for existing studies was completed by 28 September 2021.},

No similar case of internal injuries following  unintentional ingestion of a barbecue grill cleaning brush bristle has been  reported. A 58-year-old Caucasian male with no significant history presented with  complaint of halitosis, not improving after oral care and dental hygiene  measures. He denied any other symptoms. After ruling out oral causes of  halitosis, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, which revealed a black  wire-shaped metallic FB embedded in the duodenum. The FB was identified as a  silver metallic flexible wire resembling the bristle of a barbecue grill cleaning  brush. The halitosis resolved completely within 3 weeks of the removal of the FB.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of duodenal impaction of a  barbecue grill cleaning brush bristle atypically presenting with halitosis.  Physicians' awareness of this potential injury from grill cleaning brush bristles  would lead to a quick diagnosis after a focused history. Also avid grillers must  be made aware of this potential hazard and should be encouraged to carefully  examine the barbecue grill surface for any remnant bristle of the grill cleaning  brush. Appropriate history taking, considering GI causes as potentially inducing  halitosis, and an awareness of this entity among providers are important to  facilitate prompt diagnoses and prevent major adverse outcomes.},

Timing of endoscopy relies on foreign body shape and size, localization  in gastrointestinal tract, patient's clinical conditions, occurrence of symptoms,  or onset of complications. We present a case of a 47-year-old male with no known  comorbidity, who accidentally swallowed a portion of a naso-pharyngeal swab  half-broken during the second diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2. The intact swab had  a total length of 15~cm and was made of wood. The patient was asymptomatic,  laboratory tests were normal, and neck-chest-abdominal X-ray and CT scan were  negative for major complications. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was promptly  performed to prevent the long sharp swab from crossing the pylorus leading to  serious complications and, therefore, risk surgical intervention. The patient was  intubated and the procedure was carried out under general anesthesia. In the  gastric body, broken naso-pharyngeal swab was detected among the food debris, and  using a latex rubber hood, the 7.5~cm foreign body was removed with a retrieval  alligator-tooth forceps. Our hospital is located in a high-risk area of COVID-19  outbreak where many naso-pharyngeal swabs are performed, and to our knowledge,  this is the first report of swab ingestion during SARS-CoV-2 test.},

The aim of this study was to present some  practical suggestions for ingested safety pins using an accompanying algorithm,  presented for the first time in the literature to the best of our knowledge.  METHODS: Twenty children with ingested safety pins during a 4-year period were  retrospectively included in the study. RESULTS: Median age of patients was 9.5  months (interquartile range, 6.3-14 months), and 70\% were girls. On endoscopic  examination, safety pins were observed in the stomach (25\%), duodenal bulb (20\%),  upper esophagus (15\%), middle esophagus (10\%), and second part of the duodenum  (10\%) but were not observed in 20\% of the cases. Safety pins were removed using  endoscopy in 15 cases (75\%). In four cases (20\%), no safety pin was observed on  endoscopic examination. In one case (5\%) involving a 6-month-old infant, the  safety pin could not be removed although it was observed using endoscopy. No  surgical intervention was needed for any patient. No complications such as  perforation or deaths developed, except for erosions, due to the foreign body  removal procedure. CONCLUSION: Safety pins are easily removed endoscopically. The  best option is to remove the safety pin using endoscopy while it is still in the  esophagus and stomach. For this reason, endoscopic procedures should be performed  as soon as possible in children who have ingested safety pins.},

Attempted suicide may take a variety of forms; those discussed by the authors include sharp force injury, immolation and inhalation, ingestion, hanging, firearm use, jumping from a height, and drowning. Certain radiologic findings are commonly seen in cases of attempted suicide and other self-injurious behaviors. In some cases, especially when the patient is unconscious or is unwilling to provide a history, it may not be apparent that suicide has been attempted until characteristic imaging findings are recognized. Correct identification of suicide attempts on the basis of such findings will ensure that these patients receive appropriate psychiatric treatment. When a suicide attempt is unsuccessful, it is important to be familiar with the complications that may contribute to delayed mortality and morbidity. The radiologist plays an integral role in the acute medical or surgical management of patients who have attempted suicide. In addition, imaging examinations may provide useful forensic information.

  abstract = {Introduction: Intentional swallowing of foreign objects is a relatively rare psychopathological behavior. Adolescents and young adults may carry out this act to hurt themselves or even suicide. Often, most reports related to deliberate swallowing are typically either surgical or gastrointestinal and rarely are found in psychiatric articles; more often, the swallowed foreign objects (80 - 90\%) are disposed of spontaneously, and 10 - 20\% of them require endoscopy for more study and less than 1\% of them need surgery to be removed or its complications. Case Presentation: The presented patient is a 17-year-old girl admitted to the psychosomatic ward of Afzalipour Hospital due to intentional poisoning. During the year before her admission, on three separate occasions, she detached the knife blade from its haft and swallowed it. She underwent laparotomy twice, one time for sigmoid tearing and damage to the left Ovary, to remove the knife and regeneration of the left ovary and sigmoid, and another time to remove the knife in order not to cause damage to her intestines. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in the world in which an ovary has been damaged. Further investigation into her background shows some extent of privation due to her family's long-term economic problems and instability; moreover, sexual and physical abuse was also confirmed. The patient was prescribed clozapine, which decreased her suicidal behavior and attempts noticeably. Conclusions: Swallowing foreign bodies in this patient is interpreted as both self-punishment and punishing others (those who thought they were hurt or may be blamed for their despair or rejection). Intentional swallowing of foreign objects behavior is more resistant than other self-harming activities and may have a worse prognosis. Swallowing foreign objects requires a sophisticated process that, if not correctly managed, may result in serious complications; therefore, appropriate psychiatric counseling and supportive treatment are necessary for these patients. Specific to this patient eliminating the effects of suicide and reaching medical stability with a short admission was necessary. Her suicidal behavior and attempts decreased significantly after starting clozapine treatment. Therefore, clozapine treatment is recommended for patients with suicidal behavior and self-harm. {\copyright} 2023, Brieflands. All rights reserved.},

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose is to identify  the number of inadvertent ingestions of beverage-can stay-tabs by children  recognized at our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical information  system of a children's hospital was searched with key terms to identify cases in  which a witnessed or self-reported inadvertent ingestion of a beverage-can  stay-tab resulted in a radiograph to rule out presence of a foreign body.  Demographics, identification of stay-tab on radiographs, associated  abnormalities, and patient management were reviewed. RESULTS: Nineteen cases of  stay-tab ingestion were identified over 16 years. Mean age of ingesters was 8.5  years with the majority being teenagers and 15 (79\%) {$>$}5 years of age. The  stay-tab could be seen radiographically only in 4 (21\%) cases-all with the  stay-tab identified in the stomach. CONCLUSION: The identification of 19 children  who inadvertently ingested beverage-can stay-tabs at a single children's hospital  suggests that such ingestions still occur. Radiologists should be aware that  stay-tabs are radiographically visible in the minority (21\%) of cases.},

METHODS:  This paper reports the case of a patient who intentionally ingested a butter  knife that lodged in the thoracic oesophagus. After multiple endoscopic attempts,  a lateral neck oesophagotomy, aided using a Hopkins rod camera and an improvised  trochar as a protective port, was performed. RESULTS: The foreign body was  successfully extracted without causing oesophageal perforation. The patient was  made nil by mouth, with nasogastric feeding only until a swallow assessment after  one week. The patient was discharged and recovered well. CONCLUSION: This case  illustrates a successful, innovative approach to removing a foreign body in a  high-risk patient, highlighting the significance of adaptability in surgical  practice. It emphasises the need for individualised approaches based on the  patient's history, the nature and location of the foreign body, and associated  risks.},

Method: This was a  retrospective audit of medical and psychological management of a cluster of 12  DFBI incidents over 9 months in 4 young female patients with Borderline  Personality Disorder (BPD). Results: All  four patients knew one another from outpatient psychotherapy programmes. DFBI  was associated with substance use in 5/12 incidents, and with precipitants  (experiencing strong emotions, witnessing self-harm) in 4/12 incidents. Most  DFBI involved sharp objects (razor blades, glass, safety pins). Medical  intervention was initially active (endoscopy/surgery) but progressed to a more  conservative, observational approach. Psychological management was initially  restrictive, but also changed over time to focus on identifying distress,  enhancing coping mechanisms and patient responsibility. Co-ordination of  patient care management involvedintensive liaison (provision of  interdisciplinary support and  education) between medical, surgical and psychiatric teams. Conclusion: Management of DFBI in patients with  BPD requires high levels of interdisciplinary collaboration. In this cluster of  DFBI incidents, effective management was achieved with conservative  medical/surgical methods  (observation) and non-restrictive psychological approaches that enhanced patient self-efficacy.},

  abstract = {Ingestion of sharp objects is a rare event. We report our experience in the care of prisoners who ingested razor blades and the in-time evolution of our management. This is a descriptive study including all detainees ingesting a razor blade, transferred from the prison to Farhat Hached University Hospital of Sousse, from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015. Thus, we counted 19 cases of swallowed razor blades in 16 prisoners; indeed, 1 prisoner ingested a razor blade three times and another had ingested a blade twice. Our study includes 19 episodes of swallowed razor blades. In 2 cases, these events were secondary to suicide attempts. In the other cases, it was an expression of discontent and rejection of the situation in the prison. Three patients had a psychiatric history. The mean age of the patients is 24 years. The initial clinical examination had not objectified signs of gastrointestinal perforation. Thoraco-abdomino-pelvic computed tomography scans allowed specifying the blade location in all cases. It also objectified a pneumo-mediastinum in 2 cases. The blade location was esophageal in 1 case, gastric in 6 cases, and in the small bowel in the other cases. The first 4 patients had surgical removal of the blade. In subsequent cases, surgical abstention was the rule, and spontaneous blade expulsion was observed. The average time of expulsion was 4 days. In our experience, surgical removal of sharp foreign bodies should not be performed systematically without complications.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As the demand for small electronics continues to grow so does the risk of oesophageal ingestion of button batteries. These small but powerful  sources of energy are ubiquitous in every household and when swallowed,  especially in small children, have been shown to create significant injury in a  short amount of time leading to long-term morbidity and possible death. This  review highlights the latest findings regarding epidemiology, pathophysiology,  diagnosis and management of ingested button batteries. RECENT FINDINGS: Updated  epidemiology from the National Capital Poison Center, new bench research looking  at injury patterns and possible mitigation strategies, updated ideas on  management algorithms including the use of a trauma protocol, close-look second  endoscopy and management of button batteries in the lower gastrointestinal tract  are reviewed in this paper. SUMMARY: Despite advances in the understanding of  injury mechanics and innovations leading to early diagnosis and improved  management of button battery ingestion, parental and provider education remain  the most important tools to keep children well tolerated from the sequelae of  these potentially fatal events. Collaboration between healthcare experts, public  health and industry is essential to find a safe answer to this ongoing threat.},

Clinical cases and  experience with body packers has increased since the first report appeared in  1971. These cases remain an uncommon cause of acute drug toxicity and/or bowel  obstruction. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 23 year-old man was brought to the emergency  department with seizures. CT imaging revealed numerous intestinal foreign bodies,  suspicious for body packing. The patient was stabilized and taken emergently to  the operating room for exploratory laparotomy and removal of 34 cocaine packets.  Ongoing treatment for cocaine overdose was also utilized. The patient recovered  without complications. DISCUSSION: This case provides insight and awareness for  proper diagnosis and management of body packers by physicians and surgeons alike.  CONCLUSION: We present a case report of acute cocaine intoxication in a young man  who ingested 34 packets of cocaine for means of drug trafficking. Medical  approaches are available for cases in which patients remain asymptomatic, but  surgical intervention is necessary for those with signs and symptoms of bowel  obstruction or drug overdose.},

  abstract = {Background/purpose Foreign body (FB) ingestion in children is very common. Children can ingest a wide variety of FBs. Most of the ingested FBs pass spontaneously through the gastrointestinal tract. Other FBs, especially uncommonly ingested objects, can present with complications and need intervention to be extracted. The aim of this study was to highlight the importance of timely intervention to extract these FBs. Patients and methods Between November 2012 and October 2017, patients who presented to our department with variously ingested FBs were retrospectively reviewed to detect those who needed intervention (surgical or endoscopic) to extract these FBs. Results During the specified time period, 480 patients with FB ingestion presented to our department. Out of these children, 12 patients ingested uncommon FBs or presented with symptoms of complications of impaction and needed intervention to extract these FBs. Three patients ingested multiple magnets. Three patients ingested pins which were impacted in and penetrated the duodenum. One patient ingested a screw which was impacted in the appendix. One patient ingested a sticky rubber toy which was impacted in the pylorus. One patient ingested hair (bezoar), which was also impacted in the pylorus. One patient ingested a disk battery which was impacted in and penetrated the esophagus, and all were surgically extracted. One patient had a slipped stent of repaired choanal atresia which was impacted in the gastroesophageal junction and one patient with repaired tracheoesophageal fistula ingested a stone which was impacted at the site of esophageal anastomosis, and both were endoscopically retrieved. Conclusion Children who ingested uncommon FBs or presented late with symptoms of complications of impaction needed intervention (surgically or endoscopically) to extract these FBs.

Removal of FBs is not an infrequent challenge for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The aim of this study is to elicit our experience in a 5-year period in dealing with FBs in the upper gastrointestinal tract using upper endoscopy. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at Zagazig University Hospitals, Egypt, over a 5-year period. We reviewed all patients' files with full notations on age, sex, type of FB and its anatomical location, treatments, and outcomes (complications, success rates, and mortalities). Patients with incomplete files and those with FBs not identified at the endoscopic examination were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients were identified. Their ages ranged from 6 months to 102 years. Slight male predominance was noticed (53.3\%). The most frequent presentation was a history of FB ingestion without any associated manifestations (44.4\%). Coins were the most commonly encountered FBs (14/45). Esophagus was the most common site of trapping (27/45). The overall success rate was 95.6\% (43/45). Upper endoscopy successfully resolved the problem by either FB removal (41/43) or dislodgment of the impacted fleshy meat to the stomach (2/43). Two cases were referred for surgical removal. The rate of complications was 6.7\%. Furthermore, no mortalities due to FB ingestion or removal had been reported throughout the study. CONCLUSION: Our experience with FB removal emphasizes its importance and ease when performed by experienced hands, at well-equipped endoscopy units, and under conscious sedation in most cases, with high success rates and minor complications.},

METHODS: Patients older than 16 years of age who presented to the ED between January 1(st) and December 31(st) of 2010 with complaints related to swallowed foreign bodies were identified from electronic health records and patient charts. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients presented with a complaint of foreign body ingestion during the study period. Overall, an X-ray was performed on 75 patients, and a fiberoptic evaluation was performed on 45 patients. A foreign body was detected in 46 (46\%) patients. The diagnostic yield of the X-ray was 27 (36\%) out of 75 patients, while the diagnostic yield of the fiberoptic evaluations was 21 (47\%) out of 45 patients. The detected foreign bodies were mostly located in the esophagus (17 out of 46 foreign bodies detected). When the types of ingested foreign bodies were evaluated, 52 (52\%) patients reported ingesting food, and 19 (19\%) patients reported swallowing pins. An X-ray was performed on 33 patients with accidental food ingestions but yielded a positive result in only two cases. In 12 out of 21 patients with accidental food ingestion who underwent fiberoptic evaluation, the foreign material was detected and removed. CONCLUSION: Plain radiography is helpful in the localization of radiopaque swollen foreign bodies, while fiberoptic methods are useful as both diagnostic and therapeutic tools, regardless of radiopacity.},

In this study, reasons for bezoar formation, measures to be taken and treatment modalities were investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The files of the patients who were found to have gastro-intestinal bezoars and who were treated at Istanbul University, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty General Surgery Department and Emergency Unit between the years 1970 and 2005 were analysed. RESULTS: Thirteen (30\%) of the 44 patients in the study were women, 31 (70\%) were men: the mean age was 55.5 +/- 19.6 (range 22-96) years. Enzymatic dissolution (3 patients) and endoscopic fragmentation (four patients) were unsuccessful. Laparoscopic gastrotomy (n = 2), gastrotomy (n = 16), gastric resection (n = 3), enterotomy (n = 12), segmental intestinal resection (n = 3), gastroduodenotomy (n = 1), and gastrotomy + enterotomy (n = 3) were performed. In two patients, bezoars were fragmented and milked to caecum. There were no major postoperative complications, except abdominal wound infection in 4 patients and one patient who had a recurrent intestinal bezoar five years after the operation. One of the patients died because of heart failure on the 7th postoperative day. Mean hospital stay was 9.5 +/- 3.6 days. CONCLUSION: Even though rarely seen in digestive tract diseases, the probability of BZ formation should always be remembered. After the removal of BZs by conservative methods or surgery, precautions should be taken against recurrence and possible underlying psychiatric disorders should be treated.},

Incidents often involve ingestion of small metal objects (e.g., paperclips, razor blades) or other commonly available items like pens or eating utensils. Despite ingestion of relatively sharp objects, most episodes can be clinically managed with either observation or endoscopy. Surgery should be reserved for those with signs or symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or obstruction. For those with a history of IIFO, efforts should focus on prevention of recurrence as subsequent episodes are associated with higher morbidity, significant healthcare and security costs. The pattern of IIFO is often repetitive, with escalation both in frequency of ingestions and in number of items ingested.

Most cases pass through the esophagus slowly; however, in some cases, the tumor may be located in narrower areas of the digestive tract that require endoscopic or surgical intervention. This study describes a rare case of successful removal of more than 450 pieces of metal objects from the stomach of a 36-year-old man via ingestion of foreign bodies at Imam Khomeini Hospital in Ahvaz. Case presentation{\enspace} A 36-year-old male patient (Aryan race) presented with complaints of chronic abdominal pain, frequent vomiting, and intolerance to liquids and food. The patient's companions mentioned a history of gradual ingestion of small metal objects 3 months prior. The patient was conscious and had stable vital signs. In the patient's X-ray and endoscopy, multiple metal objects inside the patient's stomach were observed, causing gastric outlet obstruction. The patient underwent gastrostomy surgery, and 452 screws, nuts, keys, stones, and other metal parts weighing 2900 g were removed from the stomach. Five days after the operation, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric service in good general condition and was diagnosed with psychosis, and her condition returned to normal at follow-up. Conclusion{\enspace} Successful removal of this foreign body is rare. In chronic abdominal pain, especially in the context of psychiatric disorders, attention should be given to the ingestion of foreign bodies. In swallowing large amounts of sharp and metallic foreign objects, surgical intervention is necessary, especially in cases of obstruction, and saves the patient's life.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Intravesical foreign bodies (FBs) are rare and have interesting pathology for urologists. There has been an increase in reports of intravesical  FBs in the last few decades, but they are still considered to be rare in  children, especially young girls. Here we present our experience in the  assessment and management of intravesical self-inserted sharp objects in  children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of children with  self-introduced intravesical FBs admitted to our hospital during the last 10  years. Twenty-four cases were included in this study (20 girls and 4 boys). The  presenting symptoms and methods of diagnosis and treatment were reviewed.  RESULTS: The ages of the patients ranged from 4 to 12 years. In all cases,  foreign bodies were self-inserted. All patients were subjected to KUB (kidney,  ureter, bladder radiograph) and abdominal ultrasonography. Based on the KUB  findings, the FBs in girls were found to be metal pins in 12, a hair clip in  four, and a wooden pencil in three (Figure). In boys, a coiled electric wire was  found in three, with a urinary calculus formed over one of them. There were small  metallic objects in two cases (1 boy and 1 girl). Endoscopic removal of FBs was  done successfully in 19 cases (18 girls and 1 boy), and open cystostomy was  performed in four cases (3 boys and 1 girl). DISCUSSION: Intravesical FBs are  important considerations in the differential diagnosis of pathological lower  urinary tract symptoms. They represent significant challenges to urologists.  Among children, the reasons for self-insertion of FBs might reflect psychiatric  disorders. Routine psychiatric evaluations should be offered to all patients with  intentional FB insertion to avoid missing any underlying psychiatric disorders.  In our study, psychiatric evaluations have been advised for all the affected  children and their parents. Self-inserted FBs are commonly seen in adults and are  rarely encountered in children. To our knowledge, this is the largest reported  series of children with self-inflicted intravesical FBs. In addition, all of the  FBs in this study had one or more sharp edges that made their endoscopic  extraction more difficult without causing bladder or urethral damage. In  children, removal of intravesical FBs represents a great challenge, as the size  of the pediatric urethra may hinder safe transurethral removal. Endoscopic  handling of intravesical FBs is mostly unsuccessful in boys because of the long  and narrow urethra, and open cystostomy might be the treatment of choice to save  the urethra. In contrast, the short female urethra renders the endoscopic removal  of intravesical FBs more successful. In this study, endoscopic removal of FBs was  done successfully in 19 cases (18 girls and 1 boy), and open cystostomy was  performed in four cases (3 boys and 1 girl). CONCLUSIONS: Although FBs in the  urinary tract of children are very rare, they need to be considered during any  evaluation of pathological lower urinary tract symptoms. Endoscopic management is  feasible for most of these patients. The size, number, nature of foreign bodies,  and any associated urinary calculi determine the treatment modality.},

  abstract = {Foreign body ingestion in small children is common yet only 1\% of cases require operative management of associated complications (Arana et al. in Eur J Pediatr 160:468-472, 2001). A 6-year-old boy was referred to our institution with a 12 h history of abdominal pain. This pain was diffuse and crampy in nature and associated with multiple episodes of non-bilious, non-bloody emesis. On evaluation he was stable and his abdomen demonstrated slight distention and tenderness without peritoneal signs. Plain abdominal radiographs demonstrated some distended loops of small bowel and a radio-opaque foreign object within the mid-abdomen. A small bowel obstruction secondary to foreign body ingestion was diagnosed and an emergent laparotomy performed. Upon exploration, a transition zone was noted near the ileocecal valve. Further exploration revealed the obstruction to be caused secondary to the apposition of two small (8 mm) magnets, one in the proximal ileum and the other near the ileocecal valve, resulting in an internal hernia. The magnets were easily separated relieving the obstruction and both were removed via two small bowel enterotomies. After being presented with the magnets, his parents suspected that they came from the clothes of a Polly Pocket (Mattel, Inc., El Segundo, CA) doll. The patient had an uneventful post-operative course and was discharged to home on the second post-operative day. This case demonstrates the complications that may occur with multiple magnet ingestion. It highlights the need for close observation and early surgical intervention in children with a suspected history of foreign body ingestion, a clinical picture of gastrointestinal distress, and radiographic evidence of a radio-opaque foreign object.},

  abstract = {Polyurethane adhesives are found in a large number of household products in the United States and are used for a variety of purposes. Several brands of these  expanding wood glues (those containing diphenylmethane diisocyanate [MDI]) have  the potential to form gastrointestinal (GI) foreign bodies if ingested. The  ingested adhesive forms an expanding ball of glue in the esophagus and gastric  lumen. This expansion is caused by a polymerization reaction using the heat,  water, and gastric acids of the stomach. A firm mass is created that can be 4-8  times its original volume. As little as 2 oz of glue have been reported to  develop gastric foreign bodies. The obstructive mass is reported to form within  minutes of ingestion of the adhesive. The foreign body can lead to esophageal  impaction and obstruction, airway obstruction, gastric outflow obstruction,  mucosal hemorrhage, ulceration, laceration, perforation of the esophageal and  gastric linings, and death. Clinical signs following ingestion include anorexia,  lethargy, vomiting, tachypnea, and abdominal distention and pain, and typically  develop within 12 hours. Clinical signs may depend upon the size of the mass. If  left untreated, perforation and rupture of the esophagus or stomach can occur.  The glue mass does not stick to the GI mucosa and is not always detectable on  abdominal palpation. Radiographs are recommended to confirm the presence of the  "glue-ball" foreign body, and radiographic evidence of the obstruction may be  seen as early as 4-6 hours following ingestion. Emesis is contraindicated owing  to the risk of aspiration of the glue into the respiratory tree or the subsequent  lodging of the expanding glue mass in the esophagus. Likewise, efforts to dilute  the glue and prevent the formation of the foreign body through administration of  liquids, activated charcoal, or bulk-forming products to push the foreign body  through the GI tract have proven ineffective. Even endoscopy performed to remove  the foreign body has been shown to be unreliable. The safest, most effective, and  successful therapy is surgical intervention to remove the GI foreign body. If  performed early enough, complete recovery of the animal can be expected.  Differential diagnoses for polyurethane adhesive ingestion include any potential  cause of GI obstruction. The public is largely unaware of the hazards that  ingestion of this product may produce. Public education efforts are needed to  inform pet owners about the hazards of these glues and the overall importance of  providing our companion animals with safe, poison-free environments.},

METHOD: Five primary caregivers of children  with a history of dysphagia and/or feeding difficulties post-ingestion injury (4  chemical, 1 button battery) completed the Children's Picky Eating Questionnaire  (CPEQ), and participated in a semi-structured interview. Interviews explored  experiences of caring for a child with dysphagia and/or feeding difficulties,  impressions of services and supports, and additional impacts to the child and  family. Content analysis was used to identify key themes. RESULT: Primary  caregiver report and CPEQ results confirmed all children had some degree of  persisting dysphagia and/or feeding difficulties at time of interview (mean 4.13  years' post-injury). Interviews identified five key themes: 1) The initial trauma  of the injury, 2) The experience of associated and ongoing medical issues, 3)  Managing altered oral intake, 4) Experiences of services and support, and 5)  Impacts on the child, primary caregiver, and wider family unit. All caregivers  reported significant challenges and concerns, and potential areas of service  improvement were highlighted. CONCLUSION: The current data highlights specific  issues experienced by primary caregivers, and poses areas for improving primary  caregiver and family supports. Family-centered models of care are needed to  support the whole family unit in caring for a child with dysphagia and/or feeding  difficulties post-ingestion injury.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic antigen-mediated eosinophilic inflammatory disease isolated to the esophagus. As a clinicopathologic disorder, a diagnosis of EoE requires a constellation of clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and histologic findings (at least 15 eosinophils/high-powered microscope field (eos/hpf)). Current guidelines no longer require the failure of response to proton pump inhibitor medications to establish a diagnosis of EoE, but continue to suggest the exclusion of other etiologies of esophageal eosinophilia. The treatment goals for EoE are improvement in clinical symptoms, resolution of esophageal eosinophilia and other histologic abnormalities, endoscopic improvement, improved quality of life, improved esophageal function, minimized adverse effects of treatment, and prevention of disease progression and subsequent complications. Currently, there is no cure for EoE, making long-term treatment necessary. Standard treatment modalities include dietary modifications, esophageal dilation, and pharmacologic therapy. Effective pharmacologic therapies include corticosteroids, rapidly emerging biological therapies, and proton pump inhibitor medications. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of medical interventions for people with eosinophilic esophagitis. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP to 3 March 2023. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any medical intervention or food elimination diet for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis, either alone or in combination, to any other intervention (including placebo). Data collection and analysis Pairs of review authors independently selected studies and conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We expressed outcomes as a risk ratio (RR) and as the mean or standardized mean difference (MD/SMD) with 95\% confidence interval (CI). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Our primary outcomes were: clinical, histological, and endoscopic improvement, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Secondary outcomes were: serious and total adverse events, and quality of life. Main results We included 41 RCTs with 3253 participants. Eleven studies included pediatric patients while the rest recruited both children and adults. Four studies were in patients with inactive disease while the rest were in patients with active disease. We identified 19 intervention comparisons. In this abstract we present the results of the primary outcomes for the two main comparisons: corticosteroids versus placebo and biologics versus placebo, based on the prespecified outcomes defined of the primary studies. Fourteen studies compared corticosteroids to placebo for induction of remission and the risk of bias for these studies was mostly low. Corticosteroids may lead to slightly better clinical improvement (20\% higher), measured dichotomously (risk ratio (RR) 1.74, 95\% CI 1.08 to 2.80; 6 studies, 583 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 4; low certainty), and may lead to slightly better clinical improvement, measured continuously (standard mean difference (SMD) 0.51, 95\% CI 0.17 to 0.85; 5 studies, 475 participants; low certainty). Corticosteroids lead to a large histological improvement (63\% higher), measured dichotomously (RR 11.94, 95\% CI 6.56 to 21.75; 12 studies, 978 participants; NNTB = 3; high certainty), and may lead to histological improvement, measured continuously (SMD 1.42, 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.82; 5 studies, 449 participants; low certainty). Corticosteroids may lead to little to no endoscopic improvement, measured dichotomously (RR 2.60, 95\% CI 0.82 to 8.19; 5 studies, 596 participants; low certainty), and may lead to endoscopic improvement, measured continuously (SMD 1.33, 95\% CI 0.59 to 2.08; 5 studies, 596 participants; low certainty). Corticosteroids may lead to slightly fewer withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.64, 95\% CI 0.43 to 0.96; 14 studies, 1032 participants; low certainty). Nine studies compared biologics to placebo for induction of remission. Biologics may result in little to no difference in clinical improvement, measured dichotomously (RR 1.14, 95\% CI 0.85 to 1.52; 5 studies, 410 participants; low certainty), and may result in better clinical improvement, measured continuously (SMD 0.50, 95\% CI 0.22 to 0.78; 7 studies, 387 participants; moderate certainty). Biologics result in better histological improvement (55\% higher), measured dichotomously (RR 6.73, 95\% CI 2.58 to 17.52; 8 studies, 925 participants; NNTB = 2; moderate certainty). We could not draw conclusions for this outcome when measured continuously (SMD 1.01, 95\% CI 0.36 to 1.66; 6 studies, 370 participants; very low certainty). Biologics may result in little to no difference in endoscopic improvement, measured dichotomously (effect not estimable, low certainty). We cannot draw conclusions for this outcome when measured continuously (SMD 2.79, 95\% CI 0.36 to 5.22; 1 study, 11 participants; very low certainty). There may be no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.55, 95\% CI 0.88 to 2.74; 8 studies, 792 participants; low certainty). Authors' conclusions Corticosteroids (as compared to placebo) may lead to clinical symptom improvement when reported both as dichotomous and continuous outcomes, from the primary study definitions. Corticosteroids lead to a large increase in histological improvement (dichotomous outcome) and may increase histological improvement (continuous outcome) when compared to placebo. Corticosteroids may or may not increase endoscopic improvement (depending on whether the outcome is measured dichotomously or continuously). Withdrawals due to adverse events (dichotomous outcome) may occur less frequently when corticosteroids are compared to placebo. Biologics (as compared to placebo) may not lead to clinical symptom improvement when reported as a dichotomous outcome and may lead to an increase in clinical symptom improvement (as a continuous outcome), from the primary study definitions. Biologics lead to a large increase in histological improvement when reported as a dichotomous outcome, but this is uncertain when reported as a continuous outcome, as compared to placebo. Biologics may not increase endoscopic improvement (dichotomous outcome), but this is uncertain when measured as a continuous outcome. Withdrawals due to adverse events as a dichotomous outcome may occur as frequently when biologics are compared to placebo. Plain language summary Medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis Key messages We found that while corticosteroids may improve patients' symptoms, they certainly reduce the amount of allergic cells (eosinophils) and they may improve what the disease looks like under visual inspection (endoscopy), when compared to placebo, for children and adults with eosinophilic esophagitis. They may be just as safe as a placebo (dummy treatment). We found that biologics (a type of treatment that uses substances made from living organisms to treat disease) may improve patients' symptoms, that they certainly reduce the amount of allergic cells, and that they may be no different in terms of what the disease looks like under visual inspection, when compared to placebo, for children and adults with eosinophilic esophagitis. They may be just as safe as a placebo. What is eosinophilic esophagitis? Eosinophilic esophagitis is a long-term allergic condition in which the esophagus becomes inflamed (sore), which can lead to difficulty swallowing, vomiting, heartburn, and chest and stomach pain. Particles in foods or the air cause the immune system to have an allergic reaction and produce immune cells, which are called eosinophils. These build up in the esophagus, the tube that connects the mouth with the stomach. Eosinophilic esophagitis was first identified in the 1990s and since then it has been recognized as a major digestive illness. It is not known what causes it, but it might be related to genetics combined with environmental triggers. People with eosinophilic esophagitis tend to have other allergies as well. Currently, there is no cure for eosinophilic esophagitis, making long-term treatment necessary. Standard treatments include diets, stretching of the esophagus (dilation), and drugs such as corticosteroids, biological medications, and proton pump inhibitor medications. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if the available medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis work for improving patients' symptoms, reducing the amount of allergic cells when measured under a microscope, and improving what the disease looks like under visual examination. We also wanted to find out how safe they are and if they improve quality of life. What did we do? We searched for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing any medical treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis with any other medical treatment, in both adults and children.  What did we find? We found 41 studies with 3253 participants. Eleven studies were in children only while the rest were in a mix of children and adults. We identified 19 comparisons. In this summary, we present the results of the two main comparisons: corticosteroids compared to placebo and biologics compared to placebo. We found that corticosteroids may be better than placebo at improving patients' symptoms. We are highly certain that corticosteroids are better than placebo at reducing the amount of eosinophils (allergic cells) when measured under a microscope. Corticosteroids may be better than placebo at improving what the disease looks like under visual examination (endoscopy). We also found that people taking corticosteroids may be less likely to leave a study due to unwanted or harmful effects (side effects), and that they probably experience a similar number of both serious side effects and side effects in total, compared to placebo. There may be no difference between corticosteroids and placebo in the improvement of quality of life. We found that biologics may be better than placebo at improving patients' symptoms. It is likely that biologics are better than placebo at reducing the amount of allergic cells when measured under a microscope. Biologics may be no different to placebo at improving what the disease looks like under visual examination. We also found that people on biologics may be equally likely to leave a study due to side effects, or have serious side effects, and may experience similar numbers of total side effects, compared to placebo. There may be no difference between biologics and placebo in the improvement of quality of life. What are the limitations of the evidence? The evidence in children only was quite limited and we do not know if the conclusions above can definitely apply to children specifically. Another limitation of the evidence is that the outcomes were measured in many different ways, which may have weakened our conclusions. Other treatments used by the participants were also something that varied a lot between people, and may have affected our conclusions. Finally, we were limited in the conclusions we could make about the effects of sex, age, extent of disease, dosage, and type of corticosteroid or biologic. How up-to-date is this review? This review is up-to-date to 3 March 2023.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The general guidelines on the management of ingested foreign bodies (FBs) do not address specific aspects raised by psychiatric patients,  particularly in patients with borderline personality disorders (BPD) who  repeatedly ingest FBs. The aim of this survey was to collect data on experience  and opinions on the management of FBs in psychiatric patients with BPD and to  review the relevant literature. METHODS: A survey focusing on the indication and  the timing of endoscopy for sharp FB removal in patients with BPD was e-mailed to  215 gastroenterologists, psychiatrists, and surgeons in Switzerland, Germany and  Austria, discussing this clinical problem using a specific case vignette.  RESULTS: Responses were received from 63 of 215 (29\%) contacted physicians.  Two-thirds of the respondents knew patients with BPD who had swallowed FBs  repeatedly; 86\% recommended removing sharp FBs endoscopically even in the case of  repeated FB ingestion and 14\% of respondents argued against emergent endoscopic  FB removal in the case of repeated ingestions. Different specialities expressed  partially divergent opinions regarding the management of these patients.  CONCLUSION: Repeated FB ingestions can be a problem in patients with BPD.  Although published data show that the perforation risk of unremoved FBs is low,  most clinicians support repeated endoscopies also in the case of repeated FB  ingestions. Nevertheless, in selected cases, repeated endoscopies need to be  discussed and an interdisciplinary consensus and/or the involvement of an ethical  committee is advised.},

  abstract = {Background: Accidental or intentional subcutaneous and/or intramuscular injection of metallic mercury is an uncommon form of poisoning. Although it does not carry the same risk as mercury vapour inhalation, it may cause destructive early and late reactions. Case Presentation: Herein we present the case of a 29-year-old male patient who developed an obsessive-compulsive disorder causing auto-aggressive behaviour with injection of elemental mercury and several other foreign bodies into the soft tissues around the left knee about 15 years before initial presentation. For clinical examination X-rays and a CT-scan of the affected area were performed. Furthermore, blood was taken to determine the mercury concentration in the blood, which showed a concentration 17-fold higher than recommended. As a consequence, the mercury depots and several foreign bodies were resected marginally. Conclusion: Blood levels of mercury will decrease rapidly following surgery, especially in combination with chelating therapy. In case of subcutaneous and intramuscular injection of metallic mercury we recommend marginal or wide excision of all contaminated tissue to prevent migration of mercury and chronic inflammation. Nevertheless, prolonged clinical and biochemical monitoring should be performed for several years to screen for chronic intoxication.},

  abstract = {Background: Ovarian teratoma is a rare tumor that occurs in dogs. Its origin comes from embryonic cells of the notochord and it is a unipotent tumor. Pyometra is the accumulation of purulent content in the uterine lumen. Cystic endometrial hyperplasia is one of the factors predisposing a dog to the development of pyometra. The safest and most efficient treatment for pyometra is ovariohysterectomy. The purpose of this report was to describe a case of ovarian teratoma and cystic endometrial hyperplasia with concomitant pyometra in a Labrador Retriever Bitch. Case: A 10-year-old bitch Labrador Retriever, weighing 42 kg, was evaluated at Animal Care Barueri Veterinary Clinic, in Barueri, Sao Paulo. The patient was referred from another veterinary service to our clinic for an ovariohysterectomy and removal of an intestinal foreign body as previous ultrasonography (US) had indicated the presence of pyometra and a foreign body in the descending colon (she had ingested cloth according to the owner's report). Laboratory tests, complete blood count, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, urea, and creatinine levels did not show any significant changes. Upon examination, the clinical signs were mucopurulent vaginal discharge, 5\% dehydration, rectal temperature 39.1 degrees C, mild abdominal pain on palpation, normophagy, normodipsia, and normal defecation and urination. Laboratory tests and a new US were requested on which the uterus was observed with the presence of luminal anechoic content and increased uterine diameter (uterine horns 3.97 cm), an acoustic intestinal shadow supposedly from a foreign body, and on the leukogram, leukocytosis (23,600/mm3) due to neutrophilia with a right shift (20,532/mm3) was observed. Therapeutic ovariohysterectomy and exploratory celiotomy were chosen as therapeutic options. Celiotomy with caudoumbilical mid ventral access was performed. When the left uterine horn was identified, an attempt was made to pull it in order to expose the left ovary, but this maneuver was not successful. For this reason, the abdominal incision was enlarged cranially. At that point, a huge mass was observed in the ovary (which was supposedly the acoustic shadow of the foreign body in the descending colon/left ovary). The intestines appeared normal. Macroscopically, the mass had an irregular surface, round shape, firm consistency, and was 15 cm long x 10 cm wide. Once removed, the mass was incised in the transversal direction, purulent content, hair, and mineralized areas inside it were observed. Histopathological examination showed neoplastic proliferation, consisting of cells with elongated epithelioid shape that were arranged in long irregular bundles among well-differentiated adipose tissue. An exuberant eosinophilic matrix with extensive cystic areas filled with lamellar keratin and hairy stems covered by squamous epithelium was also observed. Extensive areas exhibiting nervous tissue with minimal atypia are shown. The morphological picture was compatible with teratoma. Discussion: The present report describes the concomitant presence of ovarian teratoma and pyometra in a dog. The diagnosis of pyometra requires complementary tests (laboratory and imaging). The intestinal acoustic shadow observed on the two US images obtained by two different professionals was suggestive of intestinal foreign body but was also a wrong diagnosis, which was confirmed after an exploratory celiotomy when the mass in the left ovary was identified. On the histopathological examination of this present case, epithelial, nervous, and cartilaginous tissues were observed. This differentiation of tissues corroborated the teratoma diagnosis. Thus, the importance of an accurate diagnosis contributes to the resolution of a surgical conditions that may have had a poor prognosis when the procedure took a longer time to perform.},

Although different studies claim that migration could be a potential risk factor for self-harming behaviours, an in-depth exploration of the presence and characteristics of self-harm in the context of asylum is needed. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was conducted across the databases Scopus, PubMed, Web of Knowledge and PsycArticles, regarding the main features of self-harming behaviour among refugees in Europe. Twelve articles and 3 main trajectories were identified: (1)               A context at-risk: self-harm and detention centres               ; (2)               A target at-risk: self-harm and unaccompanied minors               ; (3)               A comparison between the mental health of asylum seekers and natives               . Research on this topic in Europe is still underdeveloped and disorganised. Studies have mainly carried out wider quantitative investigations on mental health, usually overlapping self-harm with suicide. Detention centres emerged as the most widely investigated context and the one with the highest risk for self-harming behaviours. Instead, unaccompanied minors emerged as a particularly vulnerable category. Research in this field should be improved, combining quantitative and qualitative methods for a deeper understanding of the meanings of self-harm across cultures.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Minimally invasive esophagectomy and gastric pull-up is a widely accepted method in adults. However, the experience in the pediatric population is  limited. Minimally invasive esophagectomy represents a new alternative technique  to the conventional open approach. We wish to report our small case series of  minimally invasive esophagectomy and gastric pull-up in pediatric patients. The  aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of the  procedure. METHODS: Three patients (2 girls and 1 boy) with average age 46 months  (34-57 months) and average weight 12.6 kg (11-15 kg) underwent the procedure. The  indications for esophagectomy were esophageal stricture from caustic ingestion (2  patients) and failed repair of esophageal atresia (1 patient). RESULTS: Average  operative time was 7 h (0519-0752 hours). There were no intraoperative  complications with the average blood loss of 50 cc (5-125 cc). No anastomotic  leaks were noted on the initial esophagrams that were obtained on postoperative  day five or six. One patient developed a cervical wound infection on  postoperative day seven due to a retained piece of Penrose, which required a neck  exploration, removal of foreign body and repair of a small leak. One patient  developed an anastomotic stricture at the 7-month follow-up. She was successfully  treated with two balloon dilatations. One patient developed a delayed  esophagogastric anastomotic leak at 3 months. The leak spontaneously closed after  surgical drainage. At average of 22-month follow-up (15-36 months), all patients  were eating regular food with excellent weight gain. CONCLUSION: Minimally  invasive esophagectomy and gastric pull-up is technically challenging but  feasible and safe with acceptable outcomes. However, further study is needed to  further validate the approach.},

The aim of this paper is to report the management and the outcomes in 67 patients admitted for suspected ingestion of foreign body between December 2012 and December 2014. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at Palermo University Hospitals, Italy, over a 2-year period. We reviewed patients' database (age, sex, type of foreign body and its anatomical location, treatments, and outcomes as complications, success rates, and mortalities). RESULTS: Foreign bodies were found in all of our 67 patients. Almost all were found in the stomach and lower esophagus (77~\%). The types of foreign body were very different, but they were chiefly meat boluses, fishbones or cartilages, button battery and dental prostheses. In all patients it was possible to endoscopically remove the foreign body. Complications related to the endoscopic procedure were unfrequent (about 7~\%) and have been treated conservatively. 5.9~\% of patients had previous esophageal or laryngeal surgery, and 8.9~\% had an underlying esophageal disease, such as a narrowing, dismotility or achalasia. CONCLUSION: Our experience with foreign bodies and food impaction emphasizes the importance of endoscopic approach and removal, simple and secure when performed by experienced hands and under conscious sedation in most cases. High success rates, lower incidence of minor complications, reduction of the need of surgery and reduced hospitalization time are the strengths of the endoscopic approach.},

Radiological examinations play a crucial role in  determining the exact location of the object within the gastrointestinal tract  and in planning for its removal by endoscopic or surgical intervention. METHODS:  Medical and radiological records of 8 patients who had swallowed the broken heads  or entire toothbrush were retrospectively reviewed. This series included 4 men  and 4 women, ranging in age from 21 to 57 years (mean: 34 years). RESULTS:  Radiographs and computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated the ingested  toothbrushes within the stomach in 3, lodged in the duodenum in 1, and entrapped  in various parts of the colon in 4 patients. They were removed by laparotomy in  3, laparoscopy in 2, colonoscopy in 2, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in 1  patient. There were no perforations or associated complications, and all patients  had uneventful recoveries. CONCLUSIONS: Ingested toothbrushes can be easily  identified on radiological studies because of the radiopaque wires holding the  nylon bristles. The plastic parts of it, however, are only visible on computed  tomography. All cases would require endoscopic or surgical removal of the  retained toothbrushes because spontaneous passage per rectum does not occur.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Most retained esophageal foreign bodies (FB) are identified soon after ingestion and are easily extracted. A minority of FB ingestions are  not identified for weeks to years and present significant problems for retrieval.  The purpose of this study was to describe the diagnostic and therapeutic  strategies needed to care for children who have chronic esophageal FBs. METHODS:  Five children were identified as having retained esophageal FBs 2 months to 2  years after ingestion. During the same 3-year period, 100 children who had acute  FBs were identified and had their foreign bodies removed endoscopically. The  average age of the children was 3 years (range, 2.4 to 3.5). RESULTS: The average  age of the five children identified in this study was 3 years. The items ingested  included coins, a heart pendant, a clothespin spring, and a toy soldier.  Complications from chronically retained foreign bodies were bronchoesophageal  fistula, mediastinitis, esophageal diverticulum, and lobar atelectasis. One  patient died from an aortoesophageal fistula. In all children, endoscopic removal  was attempted. Barium esophagram was then performed, and foreign bodies were  eventually removed via right thoracotomy. CONCLUSIONS: Long-retained esophageal  FBs are extremely morbid and life threatening. History most often identifies  excess salivation, new onset asthma, and/or recurrent upper respiratory  infections. Three diagnostic adjuncts are helpful in identifying the presence of  a long retained FB: (1) Chest x-ray (PA and lateral), (2) barium swallow, and (3)  esophagoscopy. Indications for thoracotomy for removal of foreign body include  (1) Poor endoscopic visualization of FB because of inflammatory tissue and (2)  Herald bleeding during endoscopy.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Ingesting a foreign body (FB) is not an uncommon occurrence. Most pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract uneventfully, and perforation is rare. The aim of this study was to report our experience with ingested FB perforations of the GI tract treated surgically at our institution. METHODS: A total of 62 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for an ingested FB perforation of the GI tract between 1990 and 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. Three patients with no definite FB demonstrated intraoperatively were included. RESULTS: The patients had a median age of 58 years, and 37 (60\%) were male. Of the 59 FBs recovered, 55 (93\%) were toothpicks and dietary FBs such as fish bones or bone fragments. A definitive preoperative history of FB ingestion was obtained for only two patients, and 36 of 52 patients (69\%) wore dentures. Altogether, 18 (29\%) perforations occurred in the anus or distal rectum, and 44 perforations were intraabdominal, with the most common abdominal site being the distal ileum (39\%). Patients with FB perforations in the stomach, duodenum, and large intestine were significantly more likely to be afebrile (P = 0.043), to have chronic symptoms ({$>$} 3 days) (P {$<$} 0.001), to have a normal total white blood cell count (P {$<$} 0.001), and to be asymptomatic or present with an abdominal mass or abscess (P {$<$} 0.001) compared to those with FB perforations in the jejunum and ileum. CONCLUSIONS: Ingested FB perforation in the adult population is most commonly secondary to unconscious accidental ingestion and is frequently caused by dietary FBs especially fish bones. A preoperative history of FB ingestion is thus rarely obtained, although wearing dentures is a common risk factor. FB perforations of the stomach, duodenum, and large intestine tend to present with a longer, more innocuous clinical picture than perforations in the jejunum or ileum.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: As part of the oral phase of development, children commonly ingest foreign bodies. The most common lodged foreign body, requiring operative removal,  in the United States is the penny. Valued at 1 cent, comprised of materials  valued at less than 1 cent, costing 1.62 cents to manufacture, and being never  removed from circulation, pennies are aplenty. But ingestion can lead to mucosal  damage, the consequences of which can be esophageal perforation or stricture  formation. We hypothesize that the monetary value of the penny is far less than  the cost of its ingestion and removal. This quality assurance study examines the  effect of the penny on the purse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective review  identified 180 foreign bodies in children under the age of 18 over a five year  period. Eighty-two were pennies. Operative notes revealed degree of injury.  Hospital charge assessments revealed the "cost" of each visit. RESULTS: There  were no esophageal perforations, and cases were divided evenly among injury  grades 0-III. The average total charge for all penny-related injuries was  \$7164.78. CONCLUSIONS: The purpose was to examine the actual cost of a penny  (more than its value in production) and the potential cost of its damage  (thousands of dollars in measurable costs, untold immeasurable costs). The goal  of this study is to draw healthcare professional and public attention to a  potentially serious and yet highly preventable injury in young children.},

Although the current view suggests that endovascular stent-graft treatment is  useful for AEF, whether a subsequent thoracic operation is necessary remains  controversial. The purpose of this report is to describe our experience using  endovascular stent-graft treatment without combined thoracic operations for the  treatment of AEF in two specific cases. CASE SUMMARY: We presented two cases of  patients complaining of retrosternal discomfort treated in our department for an  aortoesophageal fistula caused by the accidental ingestion of a fishbone. The two  patients were effectively managed with combined means of endoscopic, medical  (broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, fasting, gastrointestinal decompression,  etc.) and endovascular stent-graft treatment. The main difference in treatment  was that the first patient presented with hematemesis after endoscopic removal of  the fishbone. Subsequently, the patient underwent endovascular stent-graft  treatment. The second case was managed with endoscopic removal of the fishbone  with simultaneous endovascular stent-graft treatment, without any signs of  hematemesis or melena. Both patients had successful postoperative management and  were discharged home. Long-term follow-up is ongoing. CONCLUSION: The treatment  decision-making process should depend on the patients' specific situations. Our  practice indicates that endovascular stent-graft treatment without combined  thoracic operations could be a valuable alternative in selected patients.},

  abstract = {Objective: Unusual clinical course Background: Unintentional medication-blister ingestion is rare but frequently leads to intestinal perforation. The diagnosis of intestinal perforation following blister ingestion is often delayed because of an unreliable history and nonspecific clinical presentation. The purpose of this case report is to raise awareness about a rare but difficult diagnosis and its importance in avoiding potentially fatal events. Case Reports: Herein, we describe successful cases of surgical and endoscopic removal after blister ingestion. The first case was that of a polymorbid 75-year-old man who presented with acute onset of abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant and epigastric regions. No indication of the cause was observed on initial computed tomography (CT). The patient developed an acute abdomen, and emergency laparotomy was performed, during which 2 small perforations were observed in the terminal ileum, and an empty tablet blister was retrieved. The second patient was a 55-year-old man who presented with a considerable lack of awareness. On the initial CT, a subdural hematoma, aspiration, and an unidentified foreign body in the stomach were observed. Gastroscopy was performed after emergency craniotomy. In addition to the initial foreign body, a second object, which had gone unnoticed on the initial CT, was found and removed from the esophagus. Conclusions: With an increased risk of perforation and difficult clinical and radiological diagnoses, prophylactic measures and special awareness of high-risk patients are particularly important.},

Some personality traits measured by the NEO Five Factor Model have been found to alter entrainment using pulsing light stimuli, but as yet no studies have examined if this occurs using steady state presentation of binaural beats for a relatively short presentation of two minutes. This study aimed to examine if binaural beat stimulation altered vigilance or cortical frequencies and if personality traits were involved. Thirty-one participants were played binaural beat stimuli designed to elicit a response at either the Theta (7 Hz) or Beta (16 Hz) frequency bands while undertaking a zero-back vigilance task. EEG was recorded from a high-density electrode cap. No significant differences were found in vigilance or cortical frequency power during binaural beat stimulation compared to a white noise control period. Furthermore, no significant relationships were detected between the above and the Big Five personality traits. This suggests a short presentation of steady state binaural beats are not sufficient to alter vigilance or entrain cortical frequencies at the two bands examined and that certain personality traits were not more susceptible than others.},

In 49 patients the ingested foreign body had passed beyond the gastroesophageal junction, and these cases form the basis of this study. Of the 49 patients, 19 (38.7\%) required surgical intervention for removal of the swallowed object. Nearly 75\% of these patients had swallowed objects that were more than 6.5 cm in length. Of 30 adults, more than 50\% required surgery for removal of the foreign body. However, fewer than 16\% of children who had swallowed and retained foreign bodies required surgery for ultimate cure. Based on these findings, guidelines are presented for the management of foreign body ingestion.},

  abstract = {Background: Gastrointestinal foreign bodies are commonly encountered; however, little knowledge exists as to the causes of foreign body ingestions and why they occur repeatedly in some patients. OBJECTIVE: To identify and define patients at high risk for recurrent foreign body ingestion. Methods: A retrospective chart review of foreign body ingestion was conducted at a tertiary care medical centre over an 11-year period. Variables analyzed included age, sex, incarceration status, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV diagnosis, success of endoscopy, type of sedation used, method of extraction, complications, presence of gastrointestinal pathology, and incidence of recurrent food impaction or foreign body. Results: A total of 159 patients with a foreign body ingestion were identified. One hundred fourteen (77\%) experienced a single episode of ingestion and 45 (23\%) experienced multiple ingestions. Of the patients with multiple ingestions, 27 (60\%) had recurrent food impactions while 18 (40\%) ingested foreign objects. In the recurrent ingestor group, a psychiatric disorder had been diagnosed in 16 patients (35.6\%) and there were 13 incarcerated individuals (28.9\%). The average number of recurrences was 2.6 per patient (117 total recurrences). Individuals with a psychiatric disorder experienced 3.9 recurrences per patient, while prisoners averaged 4.1 recurrences per patient. The combination of a psychiatric disorder and being incarcerated was associated with the highest recurrence rate (4.33 per patient). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that male sex (OR 2.9; P=0.022), being incarcerated (OR 3.0; P=0.024) and the presence of a psychiatric disorder (OR 2.5; P=0.03) were risk factors for recurrent ingestion. Conclusion: Risk factors for recurrent ingestion of foreign bodies were male sex, being incarcerated and the presence of a psychiatric disorder.},

Unfortunately, these procedures can be complicated by high rates of  recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, tracheal stenosis, recurrent fistula and  significant patient mortality. Thus, several authors have advocated the use of  esophageal rest as conservative management of acquired TEF to permit closure by  secondary intention. This study describes a patient with spontaneous closure of  an acquired TEF following disc-battery ingestion. The late recurrence of the TEF  following conservative management, and endoscopic and radiographic evidence of  closure, illustrates the importance of long term evaluation before assuming  fistula resolution. Practitioners must carefully weigh the risks and benefits  before deciding surgical versus conservative management of TEF. An extended  follow-up of at least 6 months should be instituted with a high index of  suspicion if conservative management is utilized. Transtracheal repair using an  imbricated suture technique is a good surgical option when conservative  management fails.},

RECENT FINDINGS: Foreign body  ingestion (FBI) is a problem that is frequently encountered by pediatric  providers. As new toys and products enter the marketplace, there may also be new  dangers from those objects not initially recognized. Some of the recent trends  and findings in pediatric FBI include an increase in adolescent injury from  ingestion of laundry detergent pods because of a popular game where participants  are encouraged to bite or swallow the pods, and injuries associated with  ingesting parts of a popular toy known as a 'Fidget Spinner'. SUMMARY: Adverse  events resulting from FBI range the entire gamut from nonexistent or minor  symptoms to moderate injury and rarely may be fatal. Factors such as age, type of  object ingested, anatomic location of the foreign body, and timing from ingestion  to receipt of medical attention all determine the risk posed to the child and  guide management decisions. Because of the constant development of products, and  the potential for the emergence of new and dangerous trends among children,  continued surveillance by the medical community is important in monitoring and  managing injuries associated with FBI.},

In  this paper we describe a rare case of self-inflicted penetrating head trauma by  electric drill. We document neuroimaging studies and review the management  concerning this pathology. To our knowledge, this is the first case of  intracranial retained drill bit with such radiological findings reported in the  literature. An 80-year-old male with no previous psychiatric disorder presented  at our hospital after suffering an accident while working with an electric drill.  Physical examination revealed right lower extremity plegia and three penetrating  scalp wounds to the left parasagittal region. Skull X-ray and computed tomography  demonstrated an intracranial metallic foreign body located in the left parietal  lobe and an intraparenchymal hematoma with no mass effect close to the foreign  body. The patient was taken to the operating room to remove the drill bit  fragment. Antibiotic and antiseizure prophylaxis were administered. Postoperative  computed tomography confirmed no residual metallic fragments and functional  recovery was excellent. After psychiatric assessment, suicide attempt was  confirmed and antidepressive therapy was then started. On follow-up, no  complication was documented. It is essential to exclude penetrating brain trauma  whenever a scalp wound is noticed in order to provide proper treatment and  prevention care. The permanent neurological deficit in low velocity injuries is  related to the degree and location of the primary injury. It also depends on an  early diagnosis and treatment and the absence of delayed complications.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Impaction of a soft food bolus in the oesophagus causes dysphagia and regurgitation. If the bolus does not pass spontaneously, then the patient is at risk of aspiration, dehydration, perforation, and death. Definitive management is with endoscopic intervention, recommended within 24 hours. Prior to endoscopy, many patients undergo a period of observation, awaiting spontaneous disimpaction, or may undergo enteral or parenteral treatments to attempt to dislodge the bolus. There is little consensus as to which of these conservative strategies is safe and effective to be used in this initial period, before resorting to definitive endoscopic management for persistent impaction. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of non-endoscopic conservative treatments in the management of soft food boluses impacted within the oesophagus. Search methods We searched the following databases, using relevant search terms: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL. The date of the search was 18 August 2019. We screened the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews on the topic to identify any additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of the management of acute oesophageal soft food bolus impaction, in adults and children, reporting the incidence of disimpaction (confirmed radiologically or clinically by return to oral diet) without the need for endoscopic intervention. We did not include studies focusing on sharp or solid object impaction. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Main results We identified 890 unique records through the electronic searches. We excluded 809 clearly irrelevant records and retrieved 81 records for further assessment. We subsequently included one randomised controlled trial that met the eligibility criteria, which was conducted in four Swedish centres and randomised 43 participants to receive either intravenous diazepam followed by glucagon, or intravenous placebos. The effect of the active substances compared with placebo on rates of disimpaction without intervention is uncertain, as the numbers from this single study were small, and the rates were similar (38\% versus 32\%; risk ratio 1.19, 95\% confidence interval 0.51 to 2.75, P = 0.69). The certainty of the evidence using GRADE for this outcome is low. Data on adverse events were lacking. Authors' conclusions There is currently inadequate data to recommend the use of any enteral or parenteral treatments in the management of acute oesophageal soft food bolus impaction. There is also inadequate data regarding potential adverse events from the use of these treatments, or from potential delays in definitive endoscopic management. Caution should be exercised when using any conservative management strategies in these patients. Plain language summary Use of treatments to dislodge soft foods stuck between the throat and the stomach to try to avoid the need for an endoscopy Review question Can a period of observation, treatment with swallowed substances, or treatment with substances given via the blood help to dislodge soft foods that are stuck between the throat and the stomach in order to avoid the need for an endoscopic procedure to clear it? Background Food can sometimes get stuck in the oesophagus, the pipe connecting the throat to the stomach that passes through the chest. This food often dislodges on its own, without any medical help, but occasionally a doctor's help is needed to clear it. Removing or dislodging these lumps of food can be done using a flexible camera or a rigid instrument, called an endoscope, but endoscopic procedures can have serious complications, like causing holes in the oesophagus. However, waiting for too long for the food to clear on its own can also increase the risk of a hole in the oesophagus and may lead to saliva or food falling into the lungs, causing serious infections. A variety of treatments are currently used to try to clear the food, without having to resort to an endoscopy, many of which also have potential side effects, including difficulty breathing, increased blood sugar levels, low blood pressure, and irregular heartbeat. We wanted to know if any of these treatments were better than simply waiting for the food to clear on its own, before trying to dislodge it with instruments. Study characteristics The evidence is current to August 2019. We found one trial suitable to answer our question, which compared giving a patient two drugs into a vein in (diazepam and glucagon) to placebos (clear liquids which appeared similar to the drugs but have no effect on the body). We did not look at treating sharp or hard objects, as these are treated differently. Key results There was not enough evidence to say with certainty which treatments for food impacted in the oesophagus are safe or effective. Quality of the evidence We graded the overall certainty of the evidence as low. More studies with more participants are needed to be able to answer the review question.},

This is the first case of its kind to be reported in the US to our knowledge. 49 year old male with a history of schizophrenia and foreign body ingestion (FBI) presented complaining of epigastric pain, associated with vomiting. Exam was unremarkable. Plain abdominal radiographs demonstrated a foreign body resembling a cigarette lighter visualized within the stomach. Emergent EGD showed congestion and friability in the gastric mucosa with a 5mm non-bleeding cratered ulcer in the incisura. A cigarette lighter was found in the gastric fundus and successfully removed endoscopically with polypectomy snare. He was treated with pantoprazole and was scheduled for a follow up endoscopy. FBI occurs commonly, the of which result in benign passage. Endoscopic removal is necessary in 20\% of cases, however two recent studies have shown a much higher rate of intervention in the setting of intentional ingestion. Adults with psychiatric disorders, intoxication and incarcerated individuals present more frequently with FBI. The incidence of lighter ingestion is not well reported. Patients may identify and localize the discomfort however often it may not correlate with the site of impaction. With FBI the patient may be asymptomatic, have vomiting, drooling, wheezing or respiratory distress. It is imperative to evaluate for peritonitis and small bowel obstruction. Diagnosis can be made by X-rays, non-contrast CT scan or direct endoscopy. Recommendations for emergent endoscopic intervention include complete obstruction, batteries and sharp objects but do not comment on cigarette lighters. Harmful substances contained in lighter fluid include benzene and propane. The chemical properties of the individual hydrocarbon determine the specific toxicity, while the dose and route of ingestion affect which organs are exposed to the toxicity. In our case the material lead to direct destruction of the mucosa. Complications from this direct damage may have included perforation, abscess formation, internal fistula and hemorrhage. In conclusion, immediate removal of cigarette lighters and all other foreign bodies containing hazardous material regardless of size and shape should be done. (Figure Presented).},

  abstract = {Background: Systematic research into self-harm in the Australian asylum seeker population is scarce, largely due to the lack of accessible data. The aim of this study was to examine the incidence and characteristics of self-harm across the Australian asylum seeker population, and to ascertain whether self-harm rates and characteristics vary by processing arrangements (i.e. community-based arrangements, community detention, onshore detention, offshore detention (Nauru), and offshore detention (Manus Island)), and gender. Methods: Data relating to the incidence of self-harm, method(s) used to self-harm, processing arrangements, and gender were extracted from all self-harm incidents recorded as occurring among the Australian asylum seeker population between 1st August 2014 and 31st July 2015. Self-harm episode rates were calculated using the average estimated adult population figures for the 12-month period for each asylum seeker population. Results: 949 self-harm episodes were included in the analyses. Rates ranged from 5 per 1000 asylum seekers in community-based arrangements to 260 per 1000 asylum seekers in offshore detention in Nauru. Rates were highest among asylum seekers in offshore and onshore detention facilities, and lowest among asylum seekers in community-based arrangements and community detention. The most common methods of self-harm were cutting (37\%), self-battery (26\%), and attempted hanging (11\%), with asylum seekers in held detention using a wider variety of methods than those in community-based arrangements and community detention. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the exceptionally high rates of self-harm among detained asylum seekers compared to rates observed in the general Australian population, and among asylum seekers in communitybased settings. These findings point clearly to the deleterious impact of immigration detention, and warrant urgent attention.},

  abstract = {Introduction Asylum seekers and refugees are at an elevated risk of self-harm, with younger age and traumatic experiences found to further increase such risk. Despite this, evidence regarding self-harm among unaccompanied asylum seekers and refugee minors has not been synthesised. As self-harm among minors is a risk factor for a range of adverse clinical and social outcomes, including suicide, such information may help to inform evidence-based prevention strategies among these vulnerable populations. This systematic review will synthesise findings from the literature regarding the prevalence, methods and characteristics of self-harm, including risk and protective factors, among unaccompanied asylum seekers and refugee minors internationally. Methods and analysis We searched key electronic databases (PsycINFO, Scopus, PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE) and grey literature for relevant studies published in English from database inception to 10 February 2023. Our primary outcome is self-harm among unaccompanied asylum seekers and/or refugee minors. With the exception of single-case studies, clinical trials and case-control studies, we will include all types of study design that examine the prevalence of self-harm in unaccompanied asylum seekers and/or refugee minors. We will exclude dissertations, conference abstracts, letters, book chapters, editorials, study registrations, registered protocols and qualitative studies. Only studies reporting on participants aged {$<$}18 years will be eligible for inclusion. The Methodological Standard for Epidemiological Research Scale will be used to assess the quality of included studies. If there are sufficient studies and homogeneity between them, we will conduct meta-analyses to calculate pooled estimates of self-harm rates, as well as comparisons between subgroups of relevance. If the studies do not report sufficient data, or there is substantial heterogeneity, we will provide a narrative synthesis of the findings. Ethics and dissemination This review is exempt from ethics approval. Our findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

Clinical symptoms of such  behaviour can be the self-induced incorporation of foreign bodies. In the head  and neck area, this form of autoaggressivity causes primary or secondary  infectious complications with different clinical manifestations. Below follows a  description of diagnosis, therapy and follow-up of such a case, comparing our own  findings with the corresponding literature. CASE REPORT: A 24-year-old woman with  manifest borderline personality disorder was referred to the Department of  Maxillofacial Surgery after developing a swelling in the infra-auricular region.  After antibiotic therapy failed to reduce inflammatory symptoms, local revision  was performed including excision of two metallic foreign bodies. Comprehensive  radiological evaluation identified multiple foreign bodies in the head and neck  region and lower arms. A total of 76 metallic foreign bodies was removed  surgically. During early surgical follow-up and subsequent psychiatric treatment,  the patient incorporated new foreign bodies. DISCUSSION: The case reported  represents a pattern of foreign body incorporation which is unusual based on  review of the literature but characteristic for patients with borderline  personality disorder. Diagnostics and therapy require an individual concept which  only can be implemented in close co-operation with psychiatrists. Secondary  clinical benefit derived from surgical diagnostics and therapy as well as the  possibility of autoaggressive relapse have to be taken into consideration.},

The purpose of this retrospective case series was to describe the  ultrasonographic features, histopathological findings, and clinical presentation  in a group of cats with benign small intestinal stricture. Inclusion criteria  were cats presenting during the period 2010-2017, and that had ultrasonography  and small intestinal stricture confirmed at surgery. For each cat, clinical data  and ultrasonographic findings were retrieved from the medical record, and  histopathology, where available, was reviewed. Eight cats met the inclusion  criteria. The location of strictures was duodenum (1/8), mid- to distal jejunum  (4/8), and ileum (3/8). Ultrasonographic findings included gastric distension  (8/8) and generalized (3/8) or segmental (5/8) intestinal dilation consistent  with mechanical obstruction. Ingesta did not propagate beyond the strictured  segment. Wall thickening was mild to moderate (3-6~mm). Normal wall layering was  disrupted in all cats. Strictures were predominantly hypoechoic (7/8) and  associated with hyperechoic peri-intestinal mesentery (6/8). Annular strictures  (5/8) were less than 15~mm in length whereas long-segment strictures (3/8) were  greater than 15~mm in length. Histopathology showed transmural disease with  fibrosis and inflammation (8/8), often (6/8) extending into the bordering  mesentery. The mucosa was the most severely affected layer and epithelial injury  accompanied the mucosal fibrosis/inflammation. Clinical presentation reflected  delayed diagnosis of chronic bowel obstruction with debilitation (8/8), marked  weight loss (8/8), and prerenal azotemia (5/8). Benign fibrostenotic stricture  should be considered a differential diagnosis in debilitated young cats  presenting with chronic bowel disease and ultrasonographic features of intestinal  obstruction.},

Information regarding psychiatric risk indicators was extracted from participants' psychiatric records. Generalized linear models with negative binomial distribution and log link function, as well as chi-square tests, were used to address study aims. Clients with a lifetime atypical/severe NSSI history met criteria for a significantly greater number of psychiatric risk indicators than clients with a lifetime history of common NSSI only; however, these clients were not significantly more likely to report recent suicidal actions. Individuals with an atypical/severe NSSI history may demonstrate more severe psychopathology than those with a history of common NSSI only. Thus, it may be clinically useful to consider individuals with an atypical/severe NSSI history as a high-risk subgroup. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: The body packer swallows or embeds drugs in body cavities in a purposeful way. Packets usually contain of opium, cocaine, cannabis  and amphetamines. The significant complications of body packing usually are  symptoms of drug toxicity due to leaking or ruptured packets or symptoms of  ingesting relatively large foreign bodies. Herein, we present a case of heroin  body-packing that resulted in subsequent bowel obstruction. CASE PRESENTATION: A  30-year-old male, who was brought from the prison to the emergency department,  complained of abdominal pain. After the absence of intoxication symptoms and  insignificant plain abdominal radiograph results, abdominal computed tomography  (CT) scan revealed the presence of ingested packets in the stomach as well as in  the patient's small intestine. Therefore, the decision of surgery was immediately  made for the patient, and during the surgery, the drug packets were entirely  removed. The patient was discharged in good general condition three days after  his surgery. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Body packers are in considerable risk as  rupture of packet inside the body and risk of obstruction that both of them may  be fatal. Patients should be monitored for complications, possible early  treatment, and removal or assistance in expulsion drug packets from the body.  Initially on plain abdominal radiographs, classic findings suggest the presence  of drug packets. CONCLUSION: In case of an inconclusive plain abdominal  radiograph, further investigation with CT is indicated, with an almost 100~\%  sensitivity. For symptomatic patients, bowel obstruction and acute drug toxicity  are the two most common indications for surgical intervention.},

  abstract = {AIM: To investigate predictive risk factors associated with complications in the endoscopic removal of foreign bodies from the upper gastrointestinal tract.  METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 194 patients with a  diagnosis of foreign body impaction in the upper gastrointestinal tract,  confirmed by endoscopy, at two university hospital in South Korea. Patient  demographic data, including age, gender, intention to ingestion, symptoms at  admission, and comorbidities, were collected. Clinical features of the foreign  bodies, such as type, size, sharpness of edges, number, and location, were  analyzed. Endoscopic data those were analyzed included duration of foreign body  impaction, duration of endoscopic performance, endoscopic device, days of  hospitalization, complication rate, 30-d mortality rate, and the number of  operations related to foreign body removal. RESULTS: The types of upper  gastrointestinal foreign bodies included fish bones, drugs, shells, meat, metal,  and animal bones. The locations of impacted foreign bodies were the upper  esophagus (57.2\%), mid esophagus (28.4\%), stomach (10.8\%), and lower esophagus  (3.6\%). The median size of the foreign bodies was 26.2 {\textpm} 16.7 mm. Among 194  patients, endoscopic removal was achieved in 189, and complications developed in  51 patients (26.9\%). Significant complications associated with foreign body  impaction and removal included deep lacerations with minor bleeding (n = 31,  16\%), ulcer (n = 11, 5.7\%), perforation (n = 3, 1.5\%), and abscess (n = 1, 0.5\%).  Four patients underwent operations because of incomplete endoscopic foreign body  extraction. In multivariate analyses, risk factors for endoscopic complications  and failure were sharpness (HR = 2.48, 95\%CI: 1.07-5.72; P = 0.034) and a greater  than 12-h duration of impaction (HR = 2.42, 95\%CI: 1.12-5.25, P = 0.025).  CONCLUSION: In cases of longer than 12 h since foreign body ingestion or  sharp-pointed objects, rapid endoscopic intervention should be provided in  patients with ingested foreign bodies.},

We aimed to demonstrate the association between the corrosion of lithium button batteries in the esophagus on radiographs and their complications. Methods The nine pediatric patients included in this study were classified into two groups based on the presence of severe complications. The presence and degree of corrosion on plain radiographs were evaluated. The degree of corrosion was classified into the following three grades; none: 0\%; moderate: 1-50\%; severe: 51-100\%. Fisher's exact test was used for statistical analyses. Results Of the nine patients, five showed complications. The number of patients who had grade none, moderate, and severe degrees of corrosion was three, four, and two, respectively. The incidence of severe complications differed significantly between the incidence of lithium button batteries' contour (without vs. with severe complications [presence/absence of corrosion] = 1/3 vs. 5/0, respectively; P = 0.0476). In cases with none degree of corrosion, all three cases had no complication, and in cases with a severe degree of corrosion, all two cases had complications. Conclusion The cases with the presence of corrosion of lithium button batteries had a higher tendency to have severe complications. Therefore, physicians should anticipate the presence of severe complications in pediatric patients with corrosion more than those without corrosion.},

  abstract = {Many patients who experience esophageal food impaction (EFI) will have non-endoscopic resolution (NER) of their EFI, but this population is poorly defined. The purpose of this study is to describe the outcomes of patients with NER of EFI. A retrospective chart review from 2007 to 2017 was performed at a single tertiary care center. There were 593 patients who presented to the emergency department with EFI, defined as recent soft food ingestion and inability to tolerate oral secretions. Adequate follow-up was defined as a gastroenterology clinic visit or EGD within 6 months of EFI. Out of these, 149 patients (25.1\%) had NER of their EFI. Patients with NER were less likely to have adequate follow-up than those with ER (45.0\% vs. 59.5\%, P = 0.003). Of those without established esophageal disease and NER, 92.5\% had significant esophageal pathology on endoscopy, including stricture (34.0\%), features of eosinophilic esophagitis (30.2\%), and esophagitis (22.6\%). Recurrent EFI occurred at a similar rate between patients with NER and ER (9.4\% vs. 14.6\%, P = 0.14). Patients with established esophageal disease (odds ratio [OR]: 1.51, P = 0.04) and recommendation to follow-up at time of EFI (OR: 6.06, P {$<$} 0.001) were most likely to follow up after EFI. Approximately, a quarter of patients with EFI will experience NER of their EFI. Virtually, all patients (92.5\%) were found to have esophageal disease warranting longitudinal care. Importantly, follow-up rates are significantly lower in those with NER than their counterparts requiring EGD. Our study highlights the need to develop standardized protocols that improve follow-up for patients after NER of EFI.},

Although most cases have a clear history, foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract can be  an unexpected finding after operations for other conditions. This study compares  the clinical presentations and outcomes for patients requiring or not requiring  operations. Between January 1998 and December 2001, 80 patients with foreign body  ingestion were included and divided into two groups. Specifically, group 1  patients were managed nonoperatively, and group 2 patients were managed  operatively. The patient demographics, symptoms, foreign body ingestion  mechanisms, type of diagnostic studies and management, and outcomes were compared  between the two groups. Group 1 contained 44 patients, and group 2 contained 36  patients. Group 1 patients were significantly younger, but the incidence of  underlying disease and the proportion of patients who ingested foreign bodies  intentionally or incidentally was similar in groups 1 and 2. Most of the ingested  foreign bodies in group 1 were in the esophagus and stomach, but for group 2  patients they were mostly in the small bowel. Moreover, most of group 1 patients  were asymptomatic, which was not the case in group 2. Most group 2 patients had  no known history of foreign body ingestion, and diagnoses generally were  established during surgery. Neither group of patients displayed any mortality.  Nonoperative management of foreign body ingestion usually can succeed in  asymptomatic patients with a clear history; however, ingested foreign bodies can  cause serious problems for those patients without a clear history of foreign body  ingestion.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Guidelines support endoscopic removal of certain gastric foreign bodies (FBs) and all FBs lodged in the esophagus. We studied the poorly  understood group of patients who intentionally ingest FBs. METHODS: Cases of  intentional ingestion of FBs (n = 305) were identified, retrospectively, from an  electronic endoscopy database and followed. Cases occurred among 33 different  patients, who underwent endoscopy from October 1, 2001, to July 31, 2009 (39.0  cases/year); 79\% were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. Financial cost  analysis was performed using hospital billing and cost systems. RESULTS: Commonly  ingested FBs included pens (23.6\%), batteries (9.2\%), knives (7.2\%), and razor  blades (6.9\%). Most endoscopic procedures were performed under general  anesthesia. FBs were commonly retrieved by snares (58.0\%), rat-toothed forceps  (14.4\%), and nets (11.5\%), assisted sometimes by use of overtubes (10.8\%), and  hoods (4.6\%). FB extraction was unsuccessful at the initial endoscopy in only 20  cases; 2 cases eventually required surgical extraction. Minor complications  occurred in 11 endoscopies. There were no deaths or perforations. The total  estimated costs were \$2,018,073 (\$1,500,627 in hospital costs, \$240,640 in  physician fees, and \$276,806 for security services). Costs were significantly  higher for inpatients. Major payers were Medicare (48\%) and Medicaid (31\%).  CONCLUSIONS: Intentional FB ingestion occurs among a relatively small number of  patients with psychiatric disorders and is costly. Endoscopic retrieval is  relatively effective and safe, but often requires general anesthesia. These cases  utilize significant hospital and fiscal resources. Attention should be focused on  preventing these recurrent and costly episodes.},

  abstract = {There has been a rapid expansion in the knowledge of paediatric gastroenterology over the recent decade, with a fast-growing repertoire of diagnostic techniques  and management strategies for a wide spectrum of childhood gastrointestinal (GI)  diseases. Paediatric GI endoscopy is a core competency every paediatric  gastroenterologist should possess, and represents one of the most common  procedures performed in children for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.  Yet there remains a dearth of literature on the utility and outcomes of  paediatric GI endoscopy in the Asia-Pacific region. Data on the diagnostic value  of paediatric GI endoscopy would be an important aspect of discussion, with the  emergence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and eosinophilic GI disease as  increasingly common endoscopic diagnoses. Time-based trends in paediatric GI  endoscopy do point towards more IBD and gastroesophageal reflux disease-related  complications being diagnosed, with a declining incidence of GI bleeding.  However, the real-world diagnostic value of endoscopy in Asia must be  contextualised to the region-specific prevalence of paediatric GI diseases.  Helicobacter pylori infection, particularly that of multidrug-resistant strains,  remains a highly prevalent problem in specific regions. Paediatric functional GI  disorders still account for the majority of childhood GI complaints in most  centres, hence the diagnostic yield of endoscopy should be critically evaluated  in the absence of alarm symptoms. GI therapeutic endoscopy is also occasionally  required for children with ingested foreign bodies, intestinal polyposis or  oesophageal strictures requiring dilation. Endoscopic haemostasis is a  potentially life-saving skill in cases of massive GI bleeding typically from  varices or peptic ulcers. Advanced endoscopic techniques such as capsule  endoscopy and balloon-assisted enteroscopy have found traction, particularly in  East Asian centres, as invaluable diagnostic and therapeutic tools in the  management of IBD, obscure GI bleeding and intestinal polyposis. State of the art  endoscopic diagnostics and therapeutics, including the use of artificial  intelligence-aided endoscopy algorithms, real-time confocal laser endomicroscopy  and peroral endoscopic myotomy, are expected to gain more utility in paediatrics.  As paediatric gastroenterology matures as a subspecialty in Asia, it is essential  current paediatric endoscopists and future trainees adhere to minimum practice  standards, and keep abreast of the evolving trends in the diagnostic and  therapeutic value of endoscopy. This review discusses the available published  literature on the utility of paediatric GI endoscopy in Asia Pacific, with the  relevant clinical outcomes.},

Postoperative outcomes were evaluated in a short- and  long-term follow-up using the PPOPS questionnaire. The average period of  follow-up was 26 months. All patients received the PPOPS questionnaire by  telephone in a period between April and August 2019. Results: 51\% of patients  complained of swallowing problems after surgery. In 91\% of cases, the problem  cleared up spontaneously. At the time of the interview, only 9\% of patients had a  residual swallowing difficult. At the time of PPOPS evaluation, rhinolalia was  observed in 8\% of patients, whereas nose regurgitation was present in 2\% of  patients. In 20\% of patients, the foreign body sensation was present during  follow-up. The value of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) reduced from the preoperative  value of 31.5 to the postoperative value of 11.4.

This review provides an outline of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, management,  and anesthetic implications in children who have ingested a button battery.  SOURCE: A literature search was conducted in the United States National Library  of Medicine PubMed database using the terms "button battery ingestion" and  "children' and "removal" and "surgery" and "anesthesia". Ninety-six articles  published in English were found from 1983-2017, and 62 of these articles were  incorporated into this review. Additionally, the Internet was searched with the  terms "button battery ingestion and children" to identify further entities,  organizations, and resources affiliated with button battery ingestion in  children. These additional sources were studied and included in this review.  PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Button batteries are ubiquitous in homes and electronic  devices. Since 2006, larger-diameter and higher-voltage batteries have become  available. These are more likely to become impacted in the esophagus after  ingestion and lead to an increase in severe morbidity and mortality due to  caustic tissue injury. Children at the highest risk for complications are those  under six years of age who have ingested batteries {$>$} 20 mm in diameter and  sustain prolonged esophageal impaction at the level of the aortic arch with the  negative pole oriented anteriorly. CONCLUSION: Anesthesiologists need to know  about the epidemiology, pathophysiology, complications, and anesthetic management  of children who have ingested button batteries.},

Results: Eight patients presented a total of 52 times. The incidence of DFBI increased over time. Swallowed objects included knives, needles, magnets, glass, batteries, pencils, gloves, lighters, and screws. Each patient underwent an average of 21 X-rays, 2 CT scans, and 3 OGDs. Eleven laparotomies and 1 laparoscopy were performed. The average length of stay was 44.5 days. Complications included pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, enterotomy, hernia, and infection. The average cost per patient was {\pounds}30,866.25. Conclusions: DFBI poses a significant burden on healthcare systems. Patients face radiation exposure and repeated invasive interventions, necessitating a comprehensive approach. Understanding DFBI from a biopsychosocial and ethical perspective is crucial. A multidisciplinary team should be involved early, with clear goals. Further research is needed for optimal management pathways.},

  abstract = {Deliberate single foreign body ingestion is a scenario that many gastroenterologists commonly see in psychiatric units and prisons. However,  multiple foreign body ingestions, especially located in the duodenum, provide the  endoscopist with unique challenges for management and treatment. Although most  foreign objects pass spontaneously, one should have a low threshold of  intervention for multiple objects, especially those that are wide, sharp and at  risk of perforation. Diagnosis is typically made when there is a history of  ingestion coupled with corresponding radiographic verification. The symptoms tend  to be non-specific although some patients are able to delineate where the  discomfort level is, correlating with the site of impaction. Most foreign bodies  pass spontaneously; however when multiple sharp objects are ingested, the  gastroenterologist should perform endoscopic procedures to minimize the risks of  bowel perforation. We describe here a successful case of multiple ingested  foreign bodies retrieved across the C-loop of the duodenum and the  pharynges-esophageal curve via endoscopy and review the literature of multiple  foreign body ingestion.},

METHODS:  Retrospective study, included all patients undergoing RE or FE for impacted UGIT  foreign body over an 11-year-period. RESULTS: A total of 144 patients were  included (95 FE and 49 RE). FE were performed under local anaesthetic or  sedation, and RE under GA. Success rate of FE and RE were 95.8\% and 95.9\%  respectively. During FE an intra-procedural biopsy was performed in 45/95  (47.3\%); with 26/95(27.4\%) identifying mucosal pathology. Complications was  significantly higher in patients having RE (40.8\% versus 6.3\%, p\,=\,.001).  CONCLUSION: FE and RE are effective for the therapeutic management of impacted  UGIT foreign bodies. However, FE can be performed under LA and was associated  with fewer complications, favouring FE where possible as a first line option.},

The chest radiograph showed metallic foreign bodies in both main bronchi; foreign bodies in the stomach were not observed clinically. The woman died from repeated cardiac arrest shortly after hospital admission. At the autopsy a screw and a nail were found in both main bronchi. The abdominal cavity contained 2 L of greenish purulent fluid and a massive fibrinoid peritonitis was observed. Two perforations of the stomach, each 1 cm in diameter, were detected. The stomach was completely filled with a mass of metallic foreign bodies, greenish fluid, and a bezoar of a total weight of 1,400 g; 422 distinguishable and mostly metallic foreign bodies were counted. Death was attributed to cardiac arrest in delayed shock after massive purulent peritonitis caused by two gastric perforations combined with obstruction of the airways by aspirated foreign bodies. Cases of massive swallowing of foreign bodies are mainly restricted to mentally handicapped persons, especially schizophrenics, whereas acute impaction of the larynx by large food particles occurs nearly exclusively in heavily intoxicated adults.},

We present the case of a patient with an extensive history of FBIs  and suicide attempts and a multitude of psychiatric diagnoses including  borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress  disorder from significant abuse in foster care, obsessive-compulsive disorder,  and pica. During the single hospitalization described in this report, she had  multiple incidents of self-harm, aggression, and 9 FBIs. A multidisciplinary team  involving psychiatry, emergency medicine, gastroenterology, surgery, internal  medicine, nursing, social work, behavioral health technicians, case management,  chaplain, the legal department, police officers, and hospital maintenance was  necessary for care coordination. Interventions included 8 endoscopies and an  abdominal surgery to retrieve swallowed foreign bodies, pain management,  psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions for agitation, and  environmental precautions to minimize the risk of ingestion. Ultimately, to  prevent further trauma and limit additional opportunities for FBI, a  collaborative decision was made with the patient to discharge her to her home  with outpatient psychologist and psychiatrist support. This case describes the  complexities of hospital management of a patient with intentional recurrent FBI,  highlighting the importance of a critical assessment of risk versus benefit for  prolonging hospitalization. Development of practical management protocols and  risk assessments for continued hospitalization is necessary for patients with  recurrent intentional FBIs.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients often face difficulties with swallowing, which can be due to the cancer itself or the treatment modalities like radiation therapy. The presentation of HNC can vary between developing and developed countries due to socioeconomic factors. The current study aimed to profile the swallowing function of HNC patients before starting radiation therapy in a tertiary hospital in India. Method: This cross-sectional observational study examined patients with HNC who were scheduled for radiation therapy. The Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) and Karnofsky Performance Status Scale were used to assess the patients' swallowing status and functional abilities, respectively. The study also evaluated the relationship between swallowing function and clinical-demographic factors. Results: Our assessment of 162 HNC patients found that the cancer site significantly affects swallowing. Although 92\% of patients had an oral diet, 64\% made dietary modifications. Patients with non-oral intake had either oral or pharyngeal cancer, and over 80\% of oral cancer patients and 60\% of those with pharyngeal cancer had already made changes to their diet. Patients with laryngeal cancer had a better oral intake, with 58\% reporting no swallowing issues. Conclusion: Patients with HNC scheduled for radiation therapy may experience varying degrees of swallowing difficulty. Early intervention and teaching of safe swallowing strategies are crucial to prepare for the potential worsening of swallowing difficulties resulting from the treatment. Advanced tumor stages and oral/pharyngeal cancers increase the risk of significant swallowing issues.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Foreign body ingestion is a common problem among paediatric populations. A variety of foreign bodies are ingested, some of which are particularly harmful and life threatening such as button batteries, magnets and bones. Common household items such as small toys, marbles, batteries and erasers are often ingested. The aim of this systematic review is to study the problem of foreign body ingestion among paediatric populations in terms of commonly ingested objects, and attempt to identify the link between location of impaction, associated symptoms, complications, spontaneous passage, methods and timing of removal. METHODS: A literature search of multiple databases including PubMed, Embase, Current Contents Connect and Medline were conducted for studies on foreign body ingestions. Based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 studies were selected. A qualitative review of these studies was then performed to identify commonly ingested foreign bodies, symptoms, signs and complications of foreign body ingestion, rates of spontaneous passage and methods of retrieval of the ingested objects. RESULTS: Coins are the most commonly ingested foreign body. A variety of gastrointestinal symptoms such vomiting and drooling as well as respiratory symptoms such as coughing and stridor are associated with foreign body ingestion. The oesophagus, in particular the upper third, is the common site of foreign body obstruction. Objects in the stomach and intestine were spontaneously passed more frequently than at any other sites in the gastrointestinal system. Complications such as bowel perforations, infection and death are more commonly associated with ingestion of objects such as batteries and sharp objects such as bones and needles. Ingested objects are most commonly removed by endoscopic means. CONCLUSION: Foreign body ingestion is a common paediatric problem. Batteries and sharp objects should be removed immediately to avoid complications while others can be observed for spontaneous passage. Endoscopy has a high success rate in removing ingested foreign bodies.},

Case Presentation:~           The authors present the case of a 39-year-old man who arrived at the hospital with symptoms of abdominal distension and occasional black stools for a week. The patient was known to have schizophrenia but had not received regular hospital follow-up or treatment for the past 5 years. He had a history of exogenous stimulation, which led him to surreptitiously swallow metallic objects. Upon physical examination, he displayed abdominal distension and mild tenderness in the upper abdomen. Radiographs revealed multiple foreign objects in his stomach, leading to the decision for laparotomy, gastric opening, and removal of the foreign objects under general anesthesia.           Clinical Discussion:~           Mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and multiple substance abuse, are recognized as being significant risk factors for ingesting foreign bodies. In such cases, it is crucial to intervene quickly. For patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms, the involvement of family caregivers is of even greater importance than endoscopic or surgical treatments.           Conclusion:~           Foreign body ingestion is more prevalent in individuals with psychosis, highlighting the importance of ongoing care and follow-up for patients with mental illness.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Intentional ingestion of foreign objects (IIFO) is prevalent among U.S. prisoners. IIFOs often require surgical or endoscopic interventions, extended hospital stays, and may result in significant morbidity or even mortality. Although psychiatric illness is prevalent among prisoners engaging in IIFO, this association remains poorly defined. The aim of this study is to describe the psychiatric illness profile among prisoners diagnosed with IIFO. We hypothesized that repeated episodes of IIFO are associated with an escalating pattern of documented psychiatric illness. Methods: After approvals were obtained from our Institutional Review Board and the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, a retrospective study was conducted of prisoners presenting to our facility with IIFO between 2004 and 2011. All historical and concurrent psychiatric diagnoses were abstracted from the medical record and classified into Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition based categories. In addition, medical history, alcohol/drug use, and prior episodes of IIFO were recorded. Statistical analyses included Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests for categorical and continuous data, respectively. Results: We analyzed 136 IIFO episodes involving 27 patients. Repeat IIFO episodes were associated with an increasing number of psychiatric diagnoses. Patients with their fifth or later IIFO had a larger number of psychiatric diagnoses and the number of objects ingested as compared to patients presenting with a first episode (P {$<$} 0.01). Similarly, patients who went on to present with additional episodes of IIFO during the study had more psychiatric diagnoses identified throughout their visits (P {$<$} 0.01). The proportion of patients with mood and anxiety disorders (including post-traumatic stress) was progressively greater among prisoners with recurrent episodes of IIFO (P {$<$} 0.05). Other psychiatric disorders were not significantly associated with IIFO escalation. Conclusions: We observed a significant association between IIFO recurrences and increases in both the quantity of ingested items and the number of documented psychiatric diagnoses. Of note, psychiatric diagnoses of malingering or secondary gain were not identified in the current patient sample. Consideration of early psychiatric evaluation and intervention in the setting of IIFO, especially recurrent IIFO, is strongly encouraged.

Repeated ingestions impose a high burden on staff and resources. Despite the increasing incidence of such behaviours, there is limited literature to provide effective preventative and therapeutic strategies. Aims \& Methods: We aimed to assess the characteristics of patients admitted with DFBI, report the types of foreign bodies ingested and evaluate the medical care and outcomes of those presentations. Adult patients with endoscopic records of attempted foreign body retrieval between April 2013 and September 2020 were identified retrospectively from endoscopic databases at three metropolitan hospitals within South Australia and an outer metropolitan hospital in Queensland. Only patients with intentional ingestion and underlying mental health illness were included in the study. Standard medical records were reviewed and data collected included: demographics, comorbidities and endoscopy-related, mental health-related and admission-related information. Descriptive statistics were applied. Results: Patient demographics, comorbidities and admission details are summarised in Table 1. Between 1 and 25 foreign bodies were ingested per episode with a mean number of 3.6 (SD 3.7). Most ingested objects were: razor blades and miscellaneous sharp objects (60\%), followed by button batteries (18\%) and dry cell lithium batteries (16\%). The proportion of admissions involving button batteries was observed to have increased over the 8-year study period-14 and 13 admissions reported in 2018 and 2019 respectively, compared to just 4 admissions between 2014 and 2015. Endoscopic retrieval was attempted in 160 cases with success in 111 cases, partial success in 18 cases where not all the FB were retrieved. The mean time from presentation to endoscopy procedure was 13.9 hours (SD 27.2). Only three cases of perforations leading to laparotomies were reported, 2 due to a sharp object and one to a magnet. Conclusion: We describe an increasing prevalence of DFBI in our cohort over the duration of the study, largely from patients with borderline personality disorder. A small proportion of patients have serious complications, such as gastrointestinal perforations. The increase in button battery consumption does not equate to an increase in serious complications. DFBI leads to a high number of unnecessary hospital admission stays likely associated with a huge healthcare cost burden.},

Presentation history, demographics, comorbidities and  endoscopic findings were recorded and described. RESULTS: A total of 166  admissions were accounted for by 35 patients, 2/3 of which had borderline  personality disorder (BPD). Repetitive presentations occurred in more than half  of the cohort. There was an increased trend of hospital admissions throughout the  years. At least half of the cohort had a documented mental health review during  their admission. An average of 3.3 (2.9) foreign bodies were ingested per single  episode. Endoscopic intervention was performed in 76.5\% of incidents. The  combined Length of stay for all patients was 680~days. CONCLUSION: Deliberate  foreign body ingestion in mental health patients is a common, recurring and  challenging problem that is increasing in frequency and requires collaborative  research to further guide holistic management.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: In our country, safety pin ingestion by infants is commonplace. When swallowed, open safety pins are mostly found within the esophagus or stomach, and  they cannot be easily removed by rigid esophagogastroscopy. Our aim was to  evaluate the removal of safety pins using flexible endoscopy in infants.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the cases of 7 infants who had ingested open  safety pins between 2001 and 2004. In all the patients, the primary diagnostic  tool was a direct x-ray of the neck, chest, and abdomen. In all cases, the safety  pins were removed by flexible esophagogastroduo-denoscopy. Clinical records for  the cases were reviewed. RESULTS: Four of the open safety pins were lodged in the  esophagus, two in the stomach, and one in the duodenum. One infant had a safety  pin lodged in the esophagus with the pin's open end pointed caudally; the pin was  held with the endoscopic forceps by its tail end and removed. Three safety pins  in the esophagus had their open ends pointing cephalad; these were held by their  tail ends using the endoscopic forceps and pushed into the stomach. Then they  were rotated in the stomach and removed tail end first. The safety pins located  in the stomach or duodenum were also removed similarly. All safety pins were  successfully removed, and there were no operative complications. CONCLUSION: Open  surgery or other invasive removal methods are not necessary in infants with open  safety pin ingestions. In our opinion, the best way to extract an open safety pin  from the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum is by using a flexible endoscopic  device.},

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type of complication, treatment and operative outcome. FINDINGS: The patients ranged in age from 26 to 46 years. One patient died while awaiting surgical consultation of massive gastrointestinal bleeding from a large gastric ulcer caused by a vinyl glove bezoar (VGB). Four VGBs were removed surgically. Endoscopic removal was difficult or impossible because the gloves had become hardened and matted. CONCLUSIONS: VGB should be considered in institutionalized mentally retarded people with a history of pica when they present with gastrointestinal symptoms. VGBs should be removed directly by laparotomy, gastrotomy or enterotomy. Endoscopic removal is not recommended.},

DESIGN AND SETTING: Three  hundred patients presenting with a history of either aspirating or swallowing a  foreign body were analyzed in a tertiary care center. Data were collected by  retrospective chart review and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 300  patients studied, 90\% (270 cases) did have a retained foreign body, with 233  (86.2\%) cases found in the pharyngoesophagus and 37 (13.7\%) cases in the  tracheobronchial tree. With foreign bodies in the tracheobronchial passages, the  most common sign and symptom were rhonchi (50\%) and dyspnea (67\%), respectively;  in pharyngoesophagus, the most common symptom and sign were dysphagia (64\%) and  odynophagia (45\%), respectively. The most common foreign body found was fish bone  in 39\% (106 cases) and the most common site of lodgment was the cervical  esophagus 50.5\% (136 cases). Rigid endoscopy with forceps removal under general  anesthesia was the main treatment modality. Thirty-three (12.2\%) cases had  complications secondary to retained foreign body. CONCLUSION: Foreign bodies in  the aerodigestive tract continue to be a common problem affecting adults and  children alike. Rigid endoscopies with forceps removal under general anesthesia  are the preferred management modality. From their experience, the authors  recommend that no foreign body in the upper aerodigestive tract should be left  alone with the hope that it will come out spontaneously.

Sodium-glucose  cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor has become one of the most common causes of  EDKA. We present one of the lowest presenting blood glucose levels for the EDKA  in the setting of SGLT2 inhibitor use. A 34-year-old female with a two-year  history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) presented after accidental ingestion  of a metal clip and lack of oral intake for 28 hours. She reported a recent  intentional weight loss of 60 lbs. She takes metformin 1000 mg twice daily and  empagliflozin 25 mg daily. An urgent endoscopy was planned in the intensive care  unit given the proximal location of the foreign body. The basic metabolic profile  after the procedure demonstrated a glucose level of 75 mg/dL, bicarbonate level  of 11 mmol/L, and AG of 17 mmol/L. The venous pH was 7.27 with a partial pressure  of carbon dioxide of 30 mmHg. The urinalysis showed a glucose level greater than  500 {$\mu$}mol/L with a ketone level of 80 {$\mu$}mol/L. The blood and urine toxicology  screening results were unremarkable. The patient was treated for EDKA with the  administration of intravenous (IV) dextrose 5\% in water with subsequent  initiation of IV insulin. The assessment of her insulin reserve revealed a low  C-peptide of 0.36 ng/mL, a high glutamic acid decarboxylase level greater than  250 IU/mL, and~high zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) antibodies of 42 U/mL, consistent  with an undiagnosed transition to latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).  The blood glucose levels for previously reported cases remain between 90 and 250  mg/dL. In this case, the combination of a low carbohydrate diet and prolonged  starvation may have led to the impressively low glucose. Additionally, the SGLT2  inhibitor use in patients with LADA serves as one of the known risk factors for  EDKA. EDKA poses a diagnostic challenge, especially in the ICU setting where  there exists a myriad of causes for high AG metabolic acidosis. Additionally,  many of the ICU patients are in a ketotic state brought on by prolonged  starvation. Therefore, prompt diagnosis and treatment for EDKA require careful  history taking and complete investigation for other causes of high AG metabolic  acidosis.},

One of such objects is safety pin,  which is not widely reported in the literature. The purpose of this study is to  consider the efficacy of Magill forceps for removal of safety pins from upper  esophagus. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted for all children  admitted to our hospital with safety pin ingestion from 1995 to 2003. In 58  children who had been found to ingest safety pin, the attachment site was  gastrointestinal tract. In 12 of the cases, safety pins were located in the upper  end of the esophagus. In seven of the children safety pin extraction was achieved  by using a Magill forceps with the assistance of a laryngoscope maintaining  general anesthesia with mask inhalation. RESULTS: Safety pins were successfully  removed with Magill forceps without any complications in seven patients whom they  were located in the upper esophagus. Upper esophageal safety pins in the other  five patients were extracted with rigid esophagoscopy for they were not seen  under direct laryngoscopy. There were no complications. CONCLUSIONS: This is a  preliminary report, but we believe that the Magill forceps technique for the  removal of safety pin in the upper end of the esophagus is safe and minimally  invasive method compared to rigid esophagoscopy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic procedures for foreign body ingestion (FBI) and esophageal food impactions (EFI) performed during on-call hours are associated  with increased stress, risk, and cost. We implemented a Foreign Body Algorithm  (FBA) designed to delay all but the most urgent endoscopy for EFI and FBI until  regular working hours. METHODS: Using endoscopy records from multiple academic  and community hospitals within a large integrated health system in the United  states, we identified esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) performed for food  impactions and foreign body ingestions occurring between May 2011 and February  2021. RESULTS: We identified 479 EGDs performed for FBI and EFI. The introduction  of the FBA was associated with a shorter length of stay (LOS) for overall cases  (0.35 vs. 0.8~d P {$<$}0.001), day cases (0.16 vs. 1.0~d P {$<$}0.001), and night cases  (0.40 vs. 0.6~d P =0.03). The introduction of the FBA did not change the rate of  overall adverse events (AE) or night AE. AE from the entire cohort was rare (3\%;  16 total). Of the AE, most were sedation related. The introduction of the FBA did  not affect the overall rate of night cases or AE, but the rate of after-hours  endoscopy for intentional ingestions decreased from 17.2\% to 3.1\% ( P =0.01).  CONCLUSION: This is one of the largest studies of esophageal impactions and  foreign bodies in adults in the United States, and the first to examine the  effects of a protocol designed to avoid after-hours endoscopy. These results  suggest that postponing after-hours EGD until the daytime is not associated with  adverse safety outcomes or increased LOS.},

  abstract = {Introduction: In adults with foreign body ingestion (i.e non-food objects), are usually secondary to psychiatric disorders, alcohol intoxications, and individuals seeking secondary gains. Studies suggest 80\% of these foreign bodies will pass without interventions and the mortality rate is under 0.1\%. Patients with recurrent foreign body ingestion and previous gastrointestinal tract surgeries are at higher risk of impactions, perforation, and obstruction. Sharp objects raise concern for perforation rates to 35\%, commonly at the ileocecal valve and less commonly at appendiceal lumen, cecal-ascending colon junction, colonic flexures, and rectosigmoid junction. Objects larger than 6 cm impose a risk for small bowel obstruction. There is limited evidence on the role of colonoscopy after the distal migration of foreign bodies into the ileum and colon. Case description/methods: A 53-year-old male presented with an intentional ingestion of 2 screws, 2 thumbtacks, and 1 razor head. He has a history of opioid abuse, borderline personality disorder, depression, and seven previous foreign body ingestion requiring three exploratory where he had resection of part of his stomach, small bowel, and colon. Three hours after ingestion of foreign bodies, he experienced abdominal pain and nausea and presented to the emergency department. The razer and thumbtacks were successfully removed via upper endoscopy. The screws had passed further in the small bowel. The patient was given bowel prep to increase the chance of passage of the retained screws. Serial KUB did show one screw excreted, however, the second screw did not move from the distal ileum. Repeat CT abdomen/pelvis did not show any perforation. The patient continued to have abdominal discomfort. Colonoscopy was performed with a cap. The screw was found at the ileocolic anastomosis, stuck in a fold with penetration of mucosa. It was removed with a snare. The patient's symptoms resolved. Discussion: In our case, the sharp foreign body was impacted at the ileocolonic anastomosis. Although most sharp-pointed objects in the stomach will pass without incident, the risk of a complication caused by a sharppointed object is as high as 35\%. Once Sharp-pointed things have migrated distally to the ligament of Treitz, daily radiographs should be done to document their passage. Serial abdominal exam, and surgical consultation are needed. Although the failure of a sharp object to pass through the ileocecal valve is an indication for surgery, endoscopic management can be tried first.},

  abstract = {Ingestion of foreign bodies is a common pediatric problem, with more than 100,000 cases occurring each year. The vast majority of pediatric ingestions are  accidental; increasing incidence of intentional ingestions starts in the  adolescent age group. In the United States, the most common pediatric foreign  bodies ingested are coins, followed by a variety of other objects, including  toys, toy parts, sharp objects, batteries, bones, and food. In adolescents and  adults, meat or food impactions are the most common accidental foreign body  ingestion. Esophageal pathology underlies most cases of food impaction.  Management of foreign body ingestions varies based on the object ingested, its  location, and the patient's age and size. Esophageal foreign bodies as a group  require early intervention because of their potential to cause respiratory  symptoms and complications, esophageal erosions, or even an aortoesophageal  fistula. Ingested batteries that lodge in the esophagus require urgent endoscopic  removal even in the asymptomatic patient due to the high risk of complications.  Sharp foreign bodies increase the foreign body complication rate from less than  1\% to 15\% to 35\%, except for straight pins, which usually follow a relatively  benign course unless multiple pins are ingested. Magnets are increasingly  ingested, due to their ubiquitous nature and the perception that they do not pose  a risk. Ingestion of multiple magnets creates a significant risk of obstruction,  perforation, and fistula development. Methods to deal with foreign bodies include  the suture technique, the double snare technique, and the combined forceps/snare  technique for long, large, and sharp foreign bodies, along with newer equipment,  such as retrieval nets and a variety of specialized forceps.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Eczema and food allergy are common health conditions that usually begin in early childhood and often occur in the same people. They can be associated with an impaired skin barrier in early infancy. It is unclear whether trying to prevent or reverse an impaired skin barrier soon after birth is effective for preventing eczema or food allergy. Objectives Primary objective To assess the effects of skin care interventions such as emollients for primary prevention of eczema and food allergy in infants. Secondary objective To identify features of study populations such as age, hereditary risk, and adherence to interventions that are associated with the greatest treatment benefit or harm for both eczema and food allergy. Search methods We performed an updated search of the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in September 2021. We searched two trials registers in July 2021. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and scanned conference proceedings to identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).  Selection criteria We included RCTs of skin care interventions that could potentially enhance skin barrier function, reduce dryness, or reduce subclinical inflammation in healthy term ({$>$} 37 weeks) infants ({$\leq$} 12 months) without pre-existing eczema, food allergy, or other skin condition. Eligible comparisons were standard care in the locality or no treatment. Types of skin care interventions could include moisturisers/emollients; bathing products; advice regarding reducing soap exposure and bathing frequency; and use of water softeners. No minimum follow-up was required. Data collection and analysis This is a prospective individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, and primary analyses used the IPD dataset. Primary outcomes were cumulative incidence of eczema and cumulative incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated food allergy by one to three years, both measured at the closest available time point to two years. Secondary outcomes included adverse events during the intervention period; eczema severity (clinician-assessed); parent report of eczema severity; time to onset of eczema; parent report of immediate food allergy; and allergic sensitisation to food or inhalant allergen. Main results We identified 33 RCTs comprising 25,827 participants. Of these, 17 studies randomising 5823 participants reported information on one or more outcomes specified in this review.  We included 11 studies, randomising 5217 participants, in one or more meta-analyses (range 2 to 9 studies per individual meta-analysis), with 10 of these studies providing IPD; the remaining 6 studies were included in the narrative results only.   Most studies were conducted at children's hospitals. Twenty-five studies, including all those contributing data to meta-analyses, randomised newborns up to age three weeks to receive a skin care intervention or standard infant skin care. Eight of the 11 studies contributing to meta-analyses recruited infants at high risk of developing eczema or food allergy, although the definition of high risk varied between studies. Durations of intervention and follow-up ranged from 24 hours to three years. All interventions were compared against no skin care intervention or local standard care. Of the 17 studies that reported information on our prespecified outcomes, 13 assessed emollients. We assessed most of the evidence in the review as low certainty and had some concerns about risk of bias. A rating of some concerns was most often due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors or significant missing data, which could have impacted outcome measurement but was judged unlikely to have done so. We assessed the evidence for the primary food allergy outcome as high risk of bias due to the inclusion of only one trial, where findings varied based on different assumptions about missing data. Skin care interventions during infancy probably do not change the risk of eczema by one to three years of age (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.31; risk difference 5 more cases per 1000 infants, 95\% CI 28 less to 47 more; moderate-certainty evidence; 3075 participants, 7 trials) or time to onset of eczema (hazard ratio 0.86, 95\% CI 0.65 to 1.14; moderate-certainty evidence; 3349 participants, 9 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may increase the risk of IgE-mediated food allergy by one to three years of age (RR 2.53, 95\% CI 0.99 to 6.49; low-certainty evidence; 976 participants, 1 trial) but may not change risk of allergic sensitisation to a food allergen by age one to three years (RR 1.05, 95\% CI 0.64 to 1.71; low-certainty evidence; 1794 participants, 3 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may slightly increase risk of parent report of immediate reaction to a common food allergen at two years (RR 1.27, 95\% CI 1.00 to 1.61; low-certainty evidence; 1171 participants, 1 trial); however, this was only seen for cow's milk, and may be unreliable due to over-reporting of milk allergy in infants. Skin care interventions during infancy probably increase risk of skin infection over the intervention period (RR 1.33, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.75; risk difference 17 more cases per 1000 infants, 95\% CI one more to 38 more; moderate-certainty evidence; 2728 participants, 6 trials) and may increase the risk of infant slippage over the intervention period (RR 1.42, 95\% CI 0.67 to 2.99; low-certainty evidence; 2538 participants, 4 trials) and stinging/allergic reactions to moisturisers (RR 2.24, 95\% 0.67 to 7.43; low-certainty evidence; 343 participants, 4 trials), although CIs for slippages and stinging/allergic reactions were wide and include the possibility of no effect or reduced risk. Preplanned subgroup analyses showed that the effects of interventions were not influenced by age, duration of intervention, hereditary risk, filaggrin ( FLG ) mutation, chromosome 11 intergenic variant rs2212434,   or classification of intervention type for risk of developing eczema. We could not evaluate these effects on risk of food allergy. Evidence was insufficient to show whether adherence to interventions influenced the relationship between skin care interventions and eczema or food allergy development. Authors' conclusions Based on low- to moderate-certainty evidence, skin care interventions such as emollients during the first year of life in healthy infants are probably not effective for preventing eczema; may increase risk of food allergy; and probably increase risk of skin infection. Further study is needed to understand whether different approaches to infant skin care might prevent eczema or food allergy. Plain language summary Skin care interventions for preventing eczema and food allergy Does moisturising baby skin prevent eczema or food allergies? Key messages Skin care treatments in babies, such as using moisturisers on the skin during the first year of life, probably do not prevent babies from developing eczema; may increase the chance of food allergy; and probably increase the chance of skin infection. This review looked at the prevention of eczema and food allergy only. Skin care treatments are still important to treat eczema.  What are allergies? An immune response is how the body recognises and defends itself against substances that appear harmful. An allergy is a reaction of the body's immune system to a particular food or substance (an allergen) that is usually harmless. Different allergies affect different parts of the body, and their effects can be mild or serious. Food allergies and eczema Eczema is a common skin condition  that causes dry, itchy, cracked skin. Eczema is common in children, often developing before their first birthday, and may be long-lasting. Allergies to food can cause itching in the mouth, a raised itchy red rash, swelling of the face, stomach symptoms, or difficulty breathing. They usually happen within two hours after a food is eaten. People with food allergies often have other allergic conditions, such as asthma, hay fever, and eczema. Why we did this Cochrane Review We wanted to learn how skin care affects the risk of a baby developing eczema or food allergies. Skin care treatments included: {$\bullet$} putting moisturisers on a baby's skin; {$\bullet$} bathing babies with water containing moisturisers or moisturising oils; {$\bullet$} advising parents to use less soap, or to bathe their child less often; {$\bullet$} using water softeners.  We also wanted to know if these skin care treatments cause any unwanted effects.  What did we do? We searched for studies of different types of skin care for healthy babies (aged up to one year) with no previous food allergy, eczema, or other skin condition. Search date:  we incorporated evidence published up to July 2021. We were interested in studies that reported: {$\bullet$} how many children developed eczema, or food allergy, by age one to three years; {$\bullet$} how severe the eczema was (according to a researcher and to parents); {$\bullet$} how long it took for eczema to develop; {$\bullet$} parents' reports of immediate (under two hours) reactions to a food allergen; {$\bullet$} how many children developed sensitivity to a particular food allergen; {$\bullet$} any unwanted effects. We assessed the strengths and weaknesses of each study to determine how reliable the results might be, and then combined the results of the relevant studies and looked at overall effects.   What we found We found 33 studies, involving 25,827 babies, that assessed any type of skin intervention. The included studies took place in Europe, Australia, Japan, and the USA, most often at children's hospitals. Skin care was compared against no skin care or usual skin care for babies in that country. Treatment and follow-up times ranged from 24 hours to three years. Many studies (13) tested the use of moisturisers; the other studies mainly tested the use of bathing and cleansing products and how often they were used. Of the 33 included studies, only 11 studies had comparable outcomes of eczema, food allergy, or adverse effects and were combined for analysis. All of these studies enrolled babies before they were one month old, and  eight of these studies included babies thought to be at high risk for developing eczema.  What are the main results of our review? Compared to no skin care or standard care, moisturisers: {$\bullet$} probably do not change the chance of developing eczema by age one to three years (7 studies; 3075 babies), or the time needed for eczema to develop (9 studies; 3349 babies); {$\bullet$} may increase the chance of developing a food allergy as judged by a researcher (1 study; 976 babies) by age one to three years; {$\bullet$} may slightly increase the number of immediate reactions to a common food allergen at two years, as reported by parents (1 study; 1171 babies); {$\bullet$} probably cause more skin infections (6 studies; 2728 babies); {$\bullet$} may increase unwanted effects, such as a stinging feeling or an allergic reaction to moisturisers (4 studies; 343 babies); {$\bullet$} may increase the chance of babies slipping (4 studies; 2538 babies); {$\bullet$} may not affect the chance of developing sensitivity to food allergens (3 studies; 1797 babies) by age one to three years. Confidence in our results We are moderately confident in our results for developing eczema and the time needed to develop eczema. We are less confident about our results for food allergy or sensitivity, which are based on small numbers of studies with widely varying results. These results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. Our confidence in the review findings for skin infections is moderate, but low for stinging or allergic reactions and slipping.},

METHODS: Patients admitted with ingested  foreign bodies were identified in the Kids' Inpatient Database (1997-2009).  RESULTS: Overall, 7480 cases were identified. Patients were most commonly {$<$}5years  of age (44\%), male (54\%), and Caucasian (57\%). A total of 2506 procedures were  performed, GI surgical procedures (57\%) most frequently, followed by GI endoscopy  (24\%), esophagoscopy (11\%), and bronchoscopy - in cases of inhaled objects (9\%).  On multivariate analysis, length of stay increased when cases were associated  with intestinal obstruction (OR=1.7), esophageal perforation (OR=40.0),  intestinal perforation (OR=4.4), exploratory laparotomy (OR=1.9), and gastric  (OR=2.9), small bowel (OR=1.5), or colon surgery (OR=2.5), all p{$<$}0.02.

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this report is to describe our experience in management of aortoesophageal fistulas (AEF) with special emphasis on the value of in situ aortic allograft replacement. Patients: Nine patients presenting with AEF were observed between May 1988 and April 2002. There were 4 men and 5 women with a mean age of 54.3 years (range, 32-77 years). Six patients presented secondary AEF after aortic repair. Two patients presented primary AEF after rupture of an atherosclerotic aneurysm into the esophagus. In the remaining patient, AEF was caused by swallowing a fishbone. In 6 cases involving true AEF with a direct communication between the aorta and esophagus, massive exsanguinating hematemesis occurred. It was usually preceded by minor sentinel bleeding, Two patients presented esophagoparaprosthetic fistula (EPPF). One patient presented primary AEF that was contained by a large thrombus in the communication. The clinical picture in these 3 patients involved severe sepsis without hemorrhage. Results: Two patients died as a result of massive hemorrhage before assessment and surgical treatment could be undertaken. One 77-year-old woman presenting EPPF refused to undergo surgery and died because of infection. The remaining 6 patients underwent surgical treatment with various outcomes. One man died during thoracotomy caused by exsanguinating hemorrhage. One woman presenting EPPF was treated by exclusion followed by ascending aorta to abdominal aorta bypass grafting, removal of the prosthesis, esophageal exclusion, and directed esophageal fistula. She died of infection. The other 4 patients were treated by in situ aortic allograft replacement. The damaged esophagus was repaired by using the Tha1 technique in 1 patient. In the remaining 3 cases subtotal esophagectomy was performed in association with cervical esophagostomy, ligation of the abdominal esophagus, gastrostomy, and jejunostomy. One patient died of sepsis during the first 24 hours after the operation. The other 3 patients underwent secondary esophagoplasty and survived with no further sign of infection. Mean duration of follow-up in the survivor group was 53 months (range, 15-95 months). Overall 6 patients, including 3 that did not undergo surgical treatment, died and 3 patients survived. Conclusion: Our experience confirms that AEF is a rare but catastrophic disorder. In situ allograft replacement usually in association with subtotal esophagectomy appears to be an excellent salvage modality whenever emergency surgery is feasible.},

In this study, aspiration of screwdriver  and healing abutment is reported with literature review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A  26-year-old male patient was referred from a local dental clinic with the  suspicion of ingestion of a screwdriver and healing abutment during the  second-stage surgery. The patient reported symptoms including dyspnea, cough, and  foreign body sensation. On the chest radiograph, a radiopaque foreign body  resembling the screwdriver and healing abutment was observed at the right mid  lung. RESULTS: Bronchoscopic examination using flexible cable was performed under  conscious sedation, and microforceps were used to remove the instruments.  Aspirated screwdriver and healing abutment were removed safely under intravenous  sedation. The patient did not have any symptoms associated with lung aspiration  after removal of the foreign body during follow-up periods. CONCLUSION:  Bronchoscopic removal is the most recommended procedure for removal of the  aspirated foreign body. This can be performed under conscious sedation.  Precautions, such as tethering the screwdriver, are recommended during implant  procedures.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article was to evaluate the usefulness of ultralow-dose chest CT as an initial imaging study for evaluation of sharp fish bone esophageal foreign body (FB). MATERIALS AND METHODS. A total of 57 subjects who underwent ultralow-dose chest CT were included in this retrospective study. All subjects had a history of ingestion and symptoms of esophageal FB. All ultralow-dose chest CT data were reconstructed twice, once with filtered back projection (FBP) and once with iterative reconstruction, and three observers reviewed the images independently. ROC analysis was used to evaluate diagnostic performance of ultralow-dose chest CT. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for analysis of interobserver agreement. RESULTS. Among 57 patients, 42 were confirmed as having esophageal FB. Significant objective noise reduction of mediastinum was achieved using an iterative reconstruction technique. Subjective image noise of iterative reconstruction was significantly better than that of FBP. Overall diagnostic performance of ultralow-dose chest CT for esophageal FB of iterative reconstruction (AUC = 0.999) was significantly better than that of FBP (AUC = 0.95) (p = 0.02). Interobserver agreement was greater for iterative reconstruction (ICC = 0.944) than for FBP (ICC = 0.778). CONCLUSION. Ultralow-dose chest CT using iterative reconstruction provided satisfactory diagnostic image quality for identifying fish bone esophageal FB with reduced radiation dose and high observer accuracy. Therefore, ultralow-dose chest CT would be adequate as a first-line imaging modality for fish bone esophageal FB.},

The purpose of this study is to utilize a comprehensive database to  describe the epidemiology of pediatric injuries at a tertiary hospital in Malawi.  METHODS: Data were prospectively collected on patients presenting to the  emergency department for treatment of injuries from 2008 to 2010 (n = 23,625).  The subset of pediatric patients (n = 7233) underwent cross-sectional analysis to  examine demographics, injury environment, timing and mechanisms. RESULTS:  Pediatric patients, (0-16 years) comprised 30.6\% of all trauma patients. Mean age  was 7.2 years. Falls were the most common injury (43\%), followed by burns  (11.1\%), pedestrian road traffic injuries (9.7\%), foreign bodies (7.5\%), and  assaults (7.2\%). Statistically significant differences in injury pattern were  observed between gender, age groups and season. After logistic regression,  predictors of fall included male gender, home setting, and rainy season, whereas  predictors of burn included female gender, age 0-5 yrs, home setting, and cold  season. Predictors of pedestrian injury included age 6-10 yrs, female, and  roadside setting. Predictors of foreign body ingestion included age 0-5 yrs,  female gender, home setting, and daytime, and predictors of assault include male  gender, age 11-16 yrs, nighttime hours. All predictors were statistically  significant (p {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed patterns of injury based  upon age, gender, location, and season. Our results may prove useful to  stakeholders in injury prevention for designing, evaluating, and implementing  programs to improve public safety in children in Malawi and similar resource poor  nations.},

  abstract = {Background/Aim: Appendicitis and its complications remain a common problem affecting patients of all age groups. Foreign bodies are a rare cause of appendicitis. We tried to define potentially dangerous foreign bodies that may cause appendicitis and summarize general guidelines for their clinical management. Methods: A 100-year literature review including 256 cases of ingested foreign bodies within the appendix with emphasis on: (1) objects that are more prone to cause appendicitis or appendiceal perforation; (2) foreign bodies that are radiopaque and may be detected during follow-up with plain abdominal films, and (3) guidelines for clinical management. Results: Complications usually occur with sharp, thin, stiff, pointed and long objects. The majority of these objects are radiopaque. An immediate attempt should be made to remove a risky object by gastroscopy. If this fails, clinical follow-up with serial abdominal radiographs should be obtained. If the anatomical position of the object appears not to change and, most commonly, remains in the right lower abdominal quadrant, an attempt at colonoscopic removal is indicated. If this is unsuccessful, laparoscopic exploration with fluoroscopic guidance should be carried out to localize and remove the objects either by ileotomy, colotomy, or by appendectomy. Conclusion: Foreign bodies causing appendicitis are rare. However, if stiff or pointed objects get into the appendiceal lumen they have a high risk for appendicitis or perforation. These foreign bodies are almost always radiopaque.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To study the effect of penile constriction devices used on a large series of patients who presented at our emergency facility. We explored treatment  options to prevent a wide range of vascular and mechanical injuries occurring due  to penile entrapment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2001 and March 2016,  26 patients with penile entrapment were admitted to our facility and  prospectively evaluated. RESULTS: The time that elapsed from penile constrictor  application to hospital admission varied from 10 hours to 6 weeks (mean: 22.8  hours). Non-metallic devices were used by 18 patients (66.6\%) while the other  nine (33.4\%) had used metallic objects. Acute urinary retention was present in  six (23\%) patients, of whom four (66.6\%) underwent percutaneous surgical  cystotomy and two (33.4\%) underwent simple bladder catheterization. The main  reason for penile constrictor placement was erectile dysfunction, accounting for  15 (55.5\%) cases. Autoerotic intention, psychiatric disorders, and sexual  violence were responsible in five (18.5\%), five (18.5\%), and two (7.4\%) cases,  respectively. The mean hospital stay was 18 hours (range, 6 hours to 3 weeks).  CONCLUSION: Penile strangulation treatment must be immediate through the  extraction of the foreign body, avoiding vascular impairments that can lead to  serious complications. Most patients present with low-grade injuries and use  penile constrictors due to erectile dysfunction. Removal of constrictor device  can be challenging. The use of specific tools for achieving penile release from  constrictors is a fast, safe and effective method. Patients with urinary  retention may require urinary diversion.},

He presented with severe anemia (hemoglobin of 3 g/dl and hematocrit of 8.3\%) and leukopenia (white blood count of 1,300/mm3). Work-up revealed copper deficiency (copper level of {$<$}0.05 microg/ml) and elevated zinc levels (280 microg/ml). The zinc toxicity was produced by the zinc content in the coins ingested by the patient over a period of many years. He was initially treated with -acetylcysteine and sodium bicarbonate followed by intravenous copper sulfate. He was also placed on Adolph's meat tenderizer and pancreatin thrice a day orally to loosen the massive amount of metallic objects including coins in his bowel and allow them to pass out in his feces. He was also continued on oral copper sulfate. His copper levels began to rise and reached a maximum of 0.72 microg/ml, and his zinc level fell to 153 microg/ml. However, as he refused surgery to remove the metal objects from his bowel and continued to ingest more coins, there was continued absorption of zinc, which later overcame the efforts to reduce the zinc level and increase copper levels in his blood. He finally succumbed to sepsis and multiorgan failure. Autopsy revealed a coin mass in the stomach weighing 1,870 grams in addition to a sigmoid volvulus caused by another coin bezoar in the colon.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Bezoars are collections of indigestible foreign material that are found within the gastrointestinal tract. Nonoperative  approaches such as dietary therapy, enzymatic dissolution, and endoscopic removal  have been regarded as the mainstays of therapy. The purpose of this paper is to  determine the efficacy of electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) as an alternative  form of treatment of gastric bezoars. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 1988 and  May 1996, 11 patients with large gastric bezoars, defined as those greater than 5  cm in diameter, received endoscopic-guided fragmentation using electrohydraulic  lithotripsy. Nine of our patients had a history of ingestion of "Pho Pu Zi",  (Cordia dichotoma Frost. f.), one of orange pitch, and one of ingestion of  persimmon. RESULTS: The 11 patients in the study underwent EHL for the treatment  of their gastric bezoars, with a 100\% success rate, which was defined as the lack  of residual bezoar seen on post-procedure barium study or endoscopy done 2 days  after the procedure. Patients were followed-up clinically for 30-68 months, with  seven of the 11 patients undergoing a barium study with no residual bezoar noted.  No procedure-related complications were seen, except for pharyngeal pain which  was most probably secondary to the placement of the silicon overtube.  CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopically guided electrohydraulic lithotripsy is a safe, highly  effective, alternative nonsurgical technique for the treatment of gastric  bezoars.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Diphenhydramine is a widely used first-generation histamine (H(1)) antagonist that can be obtained without prescription in many countries. Massive  ingestions can result in severe toxicity and even death. We describe a case of  diphenhydramine overdose leading to cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation  (CPR), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) cannulation for refractory  ventricular fibrillation, a process we refer to as extracorporeal cardiopulmonary  resuscitation (ECPR). CASE REPORT: Responding to a call for altered mental  status, emergency medical service (EMS) personnel found an unconscious and  seizing 17-year-old male. He had reportedly developed generalized tonic-clonic  seizures and dysrhythmias after ingesting approximately 800 25-mg diphenhydramine  tablets. He was transferred to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) after  stabilization at a local emergency center. After approximately 7~hours of  clinical stability and normalization of cardiac rhythm, electrolytes, and  acidosis, he developed renewed seizure activity and accelerated ventricular  rhythm leading to hemodynamic collapse and cardiac arrest. He was cannulated for  veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VAECMO) with CPR in progress.  A pharmacobezoar located in his stomach was presumed to be the cause of his  biphasic clinical deterioration. After 5~days, the patient was successfully  weaned from ECMO support. Ten days later, his convalescence continued in the  step-down unit and was discharged with good functional outcome. DISCUSSION:  Significant ingestion of anticholinergic substances is often fatal. This case  describes a favorable outcome after ECPR and aggressive supportive management  following a large intentional overdose of diphenhydramine.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) usually present with dysphonia, but can also be breathless and have problems with their swallowing. Speech and language therapy forms the initial mainstay of management in cases of UVFP, since up to 60\% of cases will resolve spontaneously. If vocal fold paralysis persists surgery, in the form of injection medialisation, has been shown to be an effective intervention. What is currently unclear is which is the most effective material available for injection. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of alternative injection materials in the treatment of UVFP. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 23 March 2012. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of injectable materials in patients with UVFP. The outcomes of interest were patient and clinician-reported improvement, and adverse events. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies from the search results and extracted data. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess study quality. Main results We identified no RCTs which met the inclusion criteria for this review. We excluded 18 studies on methodological grounds: 16 non-randomised studies; one RCT due to inadequate randomisation and inclusion of non-UVFP patients; and one RCT which compared two different particle sizes of the same injectable material. Authors' conclusions There is currently insufficient high-quality evidence for, or against, specific injectable materials for patients with UVFP. Future RCTs should aim to provide a direct comparison of the alternative materials currently available for injection medialisation. Plain language summary Alternative materials injected into the vocal fold (cord) for unilateral vocal fold paralysis Paralysis of one of the vocal folds (vocal cords) can have a significant impact upon a patient's quality of life. The affected patient may suffer with poor voice, breathlessness and problems with their swallowing. The treatment options include voice therapy, injection to the vocal cord or open surgery. The injection of a material into the affected vocal fold aims to improve voice, breathlessness and prevent episodes of aspiration (choking). There are a wide variety of injectable materials available and this review aimed to assess their effectiveness. Our systematic review of the relevant literature could not identify any randomised controlled trials of sufficient quality to include in this review. There is currently insufficient high-quality evidence to support the effectiveness of any particular injectable material. Further, well-designed, robust research is required in this area.},

  abstract = {Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide and takes many forms, which include hanging, jumping from a height, sharp force trauma, ingestion/poisoning, drowning, and firearm injuries. Self-harm and suicide are associated with particular injuries and patterns of injury. Many of these patterns are apparent on imaging. Self-harm or suicidal intent may be overlooked initially in such cases, particularly when the patient is unconscious or uncooperative. Correct identification of these findings by the radiologist will allow a patient's management to be tailored accordingly and may prevent future suicide attempts. The initial role of the radiologists in these cases is to identify life-threatening injuries that require urgent medical attention. The radiologist can add value by drawing attention to associated injuries, which may have been missed on initial clinical assessment. In many cases of self-harm and suicide, imaging is more reliable than clinical assessment. The radiologist may be able to provide important prognostic information that allows clinicians to manage expectations and plan appropriately. Furthermore, some imaging studies will provide essential forensic information. Unfortunately, many cases of attempted suicide will end in brain death. The radiologist may have a role in these cases in identifying evidence of hypoxic--ischaemic brain injury, confirming a diagnosis of brain death through judicious use of ancillary tests and, finally, in donor screening for organ transplantation. A review is presented to illustrate the imaging features of self-harm, suicide, and brain death, and to highlight the important role of the radiologist in these cases. {\copyright} 2024 The Royal College of Radiologists},

  abstract = {The ingestion of foreign bodies is a rather frequent occurrence in our context; ingestion may be accidental or deliberate. They can be dangerous because of their location or nature, making endoscopic extraction urgent. The aim of our study was to evaluate, using a retrospective study, the success rate of extraction of foreign bodies in our context as well as the means used. Over a ten-year period (January 2001 to January 2011), all patients admitted to the emergency services of UHC Hassan-II, Fez, for the ingestion of foreign bodies were recorded. We reviewed the methods used for extraction and the treatment success rate. During this period, 82 oesogastroduodenal endoscopies (OGDE) were performed for the extraction of foreign bodies. There was a male predominance (sex ratio: 1.5), with an average age of 33.5 years (6 to 83 years); all endoscopies were performed in an emergency. Voluntary ingestion was found in 24 cases while 58 cases were accidental. Among foreign bodies frequently encountered, there were needles in 17 cases, impaction of a piece of meat in 14 cases, ingestion of dentures in 11 cases, while other objects (coins, razor blades, nails, nail cutters) were less frequent. The foreign body was found in 32 cases at a gastric level, an oesophageal level for 31 patients, the duodenum for two patients and no foreign body was found for 14 patients. The extraction was done mainly by a hot wire loop and tripod forceps procedure; extraction was a success in 43 cases (52.4\%), a foreign body was not found in 17 cases (20.7\%), and the extraction failed in 13 cases (16\%). No complication after extraction was noted in our context.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The gag reflex is a protective response that prevents foreign objects or noxious material from entering the pharynx, larynx, or trachea; it is not  elicited during a normal swallow. Although no data have been reported to support  a relationship between the gag reflex and dysphagia, the gag reflex is  nevertheless routinely assessed during the bedside dysphagia evaluation. The  purpose of the present study was to investigate whether absence of a gag reflex  is a predictor of dysphagia. METHOD: Fourteen consecutive adult subjects referred  for a bedside dysphagia evaluation because they were considered to be at  increased risk for aspiration, specifically due to absence of a gag reflex, were  investigated. In addition, the gag reflex was assessed in 69 normal adult  volunteers. RESULTS: Although all subjects were referred for bedside dysphagia  evaluations specifically because they had no gag reflex, 86\% (12/14) were  nevertheless able to eat at least a puree diet. In addition, 86\% (12/14) of  subjects with no gag reflex had normal velar movement, reinforcing the  physiologic differences between velar functioning during phonation and the gag  reflex. The gag reflex, traditionally considered part of the bedside dysphagia  evaluation, was absent in 13\% (9/69) of nondysphagic subjects, raising further  doubts regarding its clinical relevancy. CONCLUSION: The absence of a gag reflex  does not appear to be a predictor of dysphagia.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to follow the natural course of spontaneous passage (SP) of ingested foreign bodies (FBs) in children. METHODS:  The medical records of 249 patients who ingested FBs were reviewed. In addition,  they were studied by telephone questionnaires to follow up spontaneously passed  FB. The factors associated with SP such as age, the type, size, and initial  location of the FBs were analyzed. RESULTS: Foreign bodies were spontaneously  passed in 145 patients (58.2\%), endoscopic removal was performed in 100 patients  (40.2\%), and operative removal was performed in 4 patients (1.6\%). Most SP FBs  were passed within 5 days. The SP rates (SPRs) according to the initial location  were the following: 12.2\% for the esophagus (P{$<$}0.0001), 71.4\% for the stomach,  85.7\% for the small bowel, and 96.4\% for the colon. There was no significant  difference in the SPR according to age. When coins and disk batteries that  required early endoscopic removal were excluded, the SPR was 63.4\% for FBs less  than 10 mm, 80.4\% for FBs 10 to 20 mm, 72.8\% for FBs 20 to 30 mm, and 50.0\% for  FBs more than 30 mm (P=0.091). The initial location of the FB (odds ratio, 33.7;  95\% confidence interval, 14.4-79.0) and the size of the FB (odds ratio, 3.5; 95\%  confidence interval, 1.0-11.6) were independent predictors of SP by multivariate  analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Most FBs in the gastrointestinal tract are spontaneously  passed without complication, and the initial location of FBs was found to be the  main determining factor for SPR. Ingested FBs, in children, even sharp or  relatively large FBs, can be spontaneously passed when they are located below the  esophagus.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: {\enspace}Compared with the blind technique, ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion block (SGB) reduces the amount of local anesthetic needed for a  successful block. The purpose of this study is to determine the minimal, optimal  volume of local anesthetic required for successful ultrasound-guided SGB and to  reduce its adverse effects. METHODS: {\enspace}Thirty-five patients with postherpetic  neuralgia and complex regional pain syndrome of the upper extremity and the  facial area were selected. For ultrasound-guided SGB by subfacial method, each  patient was injected with 0.5\% mepivacaine mixed with contrast media in 2{$\quad$}mL,  3{$\quad$}mL, and 4{$\quad$}mL doses at 2-week intervals. After the procedure, the spread of  contrast media in the spine was checked by fluoroscopy. Ptosis and conjunctival  flushing were rated and recorded. Adverse effects, such as hoarseness, foreign  body sensation, swallowing difficulty, and upper arm weakness, were also  recorded. RESULTS: {\enspace}Out of the 35 initial patients, the results for 33 patients  who received all three SGBs were included in this study. The contrast media  spread to 4.80{$\quad\pm\quad$}0.82, 4.94{$\quad\pm\quad$}0.86, and 5.09{$\quad\pm\quad$}0.97 total spinal segments in the  2{$\quad$}mL, 3{$\quad$}mL, and 4{$\quad$}mL groups, respectively. The cephalad spread of contrast media  was 2.16{$\quad\pm\quad$}0.74, 2.23{$\quad\pm\quad$}0.85, and 2.30{$\quad\pm\quad$}0.78 spinal segments for the 2{$\quad$}mL, 3{$\quad$}mL,  and 4{$\quad$}mL groups, respectively, and the caudad spread of contrast media was  2.64{$\quad\pm\quad$}0.51, 2.70{$\quad\pm\quad$}0.61, and 2.89{$\quad\pm\quad$}0.64 segments in the 2{$\quad$}mL, 3{$\quad$}mL, and 4{$\quad$}mL  groups, respectively. There were no significant statistical differences in any  segments for the three groups (P{$\quad>\quad$}0.05). Review of the fluoroscopic images  showed spread of the contrast media below the C7-T1 junction in all three groups.  Ptosis developed in all three groups after the procedure. CONCLUSION: {\enspace}In  conclusion, when performing an ultrasound-guided SGB, 2{$\quad$}mL dosage was sufficient  for a successful block as the previous, conventional volume. Therefore, when  performing an ultrasound-guided SGB, we recommend the 2{$\quad$}mL dosage of local  anesthetics for a successful block.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Foreign body (FB) ingestion is common in children, and button battery (BB) ingestion has been increasing in recent years. This study was to identify  factors related to outcomes of FB ingestion, particularly BBs in the stomach. We  evaluated whether the current recommendations are appropriate and aimed to  suggest indications for endoscopic removal of BB in the stomach in young  children. METHODS: We investigated patient age, shape, size, location of FBs,  spontaneous passage time and resulting complications among 76 children. We  observed types, size, location of BB and outcomes, and analyzed their  associations with complications. RESULTS: Coins and BB were the two most common  FBs. Their shapes and sizes were not associated with the spontaneous passage  time. Size, spontaneous passage time, and age were also not associated with any  specific complications. For BB ingestion, all 5 cases with lithium batteries  ({$\geq$}1.5 cm, 3 V) presented moderate to major complications in the esophagus and  stomach without any symptoms, even when the batteries were in the stomach and  beyond the duodenum, while no complications were noted in 7 cases with alkaline  batteries ({$<$}1.5 cm, 1.5 V) (p=0.001). All endoscopies were conducted within 24  hours after ingestion. CONCLUSION: The type and voltage of the battery should be  considered when determining whether endoscopy is required to remove a BB in the  stomach. For lithium battery ingestion in young children, urgent endoscopic  removal might be important in order to prevent complications, even if the child  is asymptomatic and the battery is smaller than 2 cm.},

Magnets pose a unique set of risks when ingested due to their attractive forces  and subsequent risk of adherence, pressure necrosis, and perforation  complications. Radiographs only provide a limited snapshot in the setting of  multiple magnet ingestion when the risk of complication is highest. We  hypothesize that abdominal ultrasound (US) has the potential to supplement  radiographs in assessing ingested magnets by determining the presence of bowel  loop entrapment and of any extraluminal fluid. METHODS: We recreated various  scenarios of magnet configurations using animal cadaveric bowel models. X-ray and  US images were obtained in various bowel-magnet orientations. RESULTS: We  identified several key US features to suggest bowel wall tethering. These include  direct visualization of bowel wall entrapment between magnets (what we term the  "dangerous V sign"), anti-dependent positions of the magnets, and inability to  separate loops of bowel with compression. CONCLUSION: These findings could  potentially provide valuable information when directing the urgency of  intervention~in foreign body ingestion. Ultrasound may supplement and improve the  current guidelines in management of magnet ingestion.},

  abstract = {Background: Travelers' diarrhea is the most common travel-related malady. It affects millions of international travelers to developing countries annually and can significantly disrupt travel plans. Objective: To provide an update on the evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of traveler's diarrhea. Methods: A PubMed search was completed in Clinical Queries using the key term traveler's diarrhea. The search strategy included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews. The search was restricted to English literature. Patents were searched using the key term traveler's diarrhea from www.freepatentsonline.com. Results: Between 10\% and 40\% of travelers develop diarrhea. The attack rate is highest for travelers from a developed country who visit a developing country. Children are at particular risk. Travelers' diarrhea is usually acquired through ingestion of food and water contaminated by feces. Most cases are due to a bacterial pathogen, commonly, Escherichia coli, and occur within the first few days after arrival in a foreign country. Dehydration is the most common complication. Pretravel education on hygiene and on the safe selection of food items is important in minimizing episodes. For mild travelers' diarrhea, the use of antibiotic is not recommended. The use of bismuth subsalicylate or loperamide may be considered. For moderate travelers' diarrhea, antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, and rifaximin may be used. Loperamide may be considered as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. For severe travelers' diarrhea, antibiotics such as azithromycin, fluoroquinolones, and rifaximin should be used. Azithromycin can be used even for the treatment of dysentery whereas fluoroquinolones and rifaximin cannot be used for such purpose. Recent patents related to the management of travelers' diarrhea are discussed. Conclusion: Although travelers' diarrhea is usually self-limited, many travelers prefer expedient relief of diarrhea, especially when they are traveling for extended periods by air or ground. Judicious use of an antimotility agent and antimicrobial therapy reduces the duration and severity of diarrhea.},

Much has been written about psychiatric patients  engaging in self-mutilation such as cutting and burning, but little is recorded  about deliberate aspiration of objects in these patients, who clinically can be  separated into 4 groups: (1) malingering, (2) psychosis, (3) pica, and (4)  personality disorders. The immediate psychological gain for these patients is  unclear, as the act is insidious with no evidence of intentional harm or  immediate danger. Thus, they are considered as being parasuicidal events designed  to diminish other psychological processes. Aspirated objects that are not  immediately dislodged by coughing, choking, or gagging require surgical  intervention. Most of these patients usually come to the attention of a  psychiatrist, but such intervention does not prevent recurrences. We discuss a  schizophrenic patient who aspirated multiple coins while under psychiatric  treatment for prior episodes of aspiration of coins, ingestion of objects, and  insertion of others in his urethra and rectum, while also reviewing some of the  diagnostic and therapeutic challenges inherent in the management of these  patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Foreign body ingestion is a scenario occasionally encountered in the emergency room. Pediatric and psychiatric patients are the two most common  populations suffering from accidental or in some cases intentional ingestion of  foreign bodies. Commonly, majority of cases require no specific treatment and the  swallowed objects pass through the digestive tract spontaneously without causing  any significant complications. Less than 1\% of the cases complicates with  gastrointestinal tract perforation, which are often caused by sharp objects,  which warrants surgical intervention. The average time from foreign body  ingestion to development of perforation was noted at 10.4\,days in previous  reports. These cases often present in rapidly progressing peritonitis and are  subsequently managed by emergent laparotomy. In this case report, we describe an  accidental chopstick ingestion of a patient who initially was misdiagnosed and  remained asymptomatic for nine months, then presented with acute abdomen. CASE  PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old man accidentally ingested a wooden chopstick and  sought consult at a clinic. Negative abdominal plain film misled the physician to  believe ingested chopstick was digested into fragments and passed out unnoticed.  The patient presented acute abdomen caused by duodenal perforation nine months  later and was subsequently treated with emergency laparotomy with primary  duodenorrhaphy. CONCLUSIONS: Negative plain films are not sufficient to conclude  a conservative treatment in foreign body ingestion. Computed tomography scan or  endoscopic examinations should be done to rule out retained foreign body within  gastrointestinal tract.},

METHODS: A prospective study including consecutive adult patients with foreign body ingestion or suspected food impaction between May 2014 and August 2016. RESULTS: In total, 521 patients were included, 320 with foreign body ingestion and 201 with suspected food impaction. Food impaction patients were significantly older and more frequently had a history of oesophageal disease. The foreign body was encountered in the upper digestive tract in 43\% of the patients with foreign body ingestion, and food impaction was confirmed in 87\%. Older age (odds ratio (OR)year 1.04, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.06) and early presentation (ORfirst six hours 4.41, 95\% CI 2.24-8.66) were independent predictors of foreign body presence, while a history of psychiatric disease was an independent predictor of food impaction (OR 6.69, 95\% CI 1.66-26.9). Successful endoscopic treatment was achieved in more than 90\% of the cases, with adverse events occurring in fewer than 5\%. Foreign body forceps was the preferred device in foreign body ingestion, while retrieval basket and mobilisation were preferred in food impaction. The need to use more than one instrument was significantly higher in food impaction. CONCLUSION: Foreign bodies are encountered at endoscopy in almost half of the cases. Older age and earlier presentation are independent predictors of its presence. Given the high proportion of patients with foreign body at endoscopy and the low risk of complications, endoscopic evaluation is probably justified in the majority of cases.},

  abstract = {The aim of our article is to study the incidence, diagnosis, and treatment of bowel perforation by foreign body ingestion. Bowel perforation by foreign body ingestion has been believed to be relatively rare, and most commonly caused by fish bones, chicken bones, and toothpicks. Our clinical experience, however, suggests such perforations may be more common than previously thought, and caused by various other objects as well. Medical records of all patients diagnosed with foreign body-induced intestinal perforation, from the Department of General Surgery at Tonji Hospital, from January 2000 to June 2015, were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 17 men and 8 women suffered intestinal perforations by ingestion of dietary foreign bodies. Among the 25 total patients, 4 ingested foreign bodies intentionally, whereas the other 21 cases were accidental. The foreign bodies were identified by plain X-ray film in 2 patients (2 cases of needles) and by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in 11 patients (6 cases of date stones, 3 cases of metallic objects, and 2 cases of bone fragments), thus supporting the correct preoperative diagnosis (13 cases; 52\%). The most common location of the perforation was the terminal ileum (n = 17). The offending objects were date stones (n = 13), bones (n = 7), and metallic objects (n = 5). The most common treatment was removal of the foreign body and closure of the perforation with simple suture (n = 22). Ten patients were treated laparoscopically. The present study shows that the most common foreign bodies causing intestinal perforation are date stones and bones. Although about 50\% of the foreign bodies could be identified by MDCT, definite diagnosis remained preoperatively difficult. Consequently, because of high misdiagnosis rates, laparoscopy may be the optimal choice for diagnosis and treatment of bowel perforation by foreign bodies.},

Normal  values of this ratio have been established for subjects of different ethnicity,  but the differences between genders and race have not been critically compared.  PURPOSE: To establish normal cervical spinal dimensions and analyze the  differences observed between men and women, and between reports using subjects of  different ethnicity. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Observational. PATIENT SAMPLE: Forty  men and 40 women of Chinese descent with no history or symptoms of neck pathology  selected from patients presenting to the Emergency Department for foreign body  ingestion. OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements of the sagittal developmental diameter  (SDD) and vertebral body diameter (VB) on the lateral cervical radiograph with  calculation of SDD/VB (Torg ratio). METHODS: Lateral radiographs of the cervical  spine were taken in a standardized manner with a 180-cm film-to-tube distance.  Comparison was made between genders in the study population and with previous  reports on subjects of different ethnicity. RESULTS: The SDD was narrowest at the  C4 level in both men and women. Women had smaller SDDs at all levels of the  cervical spine. Female VBs were of sizes similar to their corresponding SDDs,  whereas men had larger VBs. This resulted in small Torg ratios in men averaging  0.87. Comparison with previous reports demonstrated consistent variation in the  SDD, which increased serially from Japanese, through Chinese and Indian, to white  subjects. The relationship of VB to the corresponding SDD displayed wide  variation between reports. This resulted in Torg ratios differing not only  between subjects of different ethnicity but also between genders within the same  population. CONCLUSIONS: The Torg ratio is not a consistent indicator of the SDD  and may not be used to reliably identify the presence of cervical canal stenosis.},

METHODS:  Based on the medical records of patients younger than 15 years old who visited  emergency room because of foreign body ingestion from January 1999 to December  2012, the authors reviewed clinical characteristics including type of ingested  foreign bodies, time to visits, managements and complications. RESULTS: Fishbone  (50.1\%) was the most common ingested foreign body in children. Among 416 patients  with ingested fishbone, 245 (58.9\%) were identified and removed using  laryngoscope, rigid or flexible endoscope from pharynx or upper esophagus by  otolaryngologists and pediatric gastroenterologists. The kind of ingested fish  bone in children was diverse. The mean age of identified and removed fishbone  group was 7.39 years old, and higher than that of unidentified fishbone group  (5.81 years old, p{$<$}0.001). Identified and removed fishbone group had shorter time  until hospital visit than the unidentified fishbone group (2.03 vs. 6.47 hours,  p{$<$}0.001). No complication due to ingested fishbone or procedure occurred.  CONCLUSION: Older age and shorter time from accident to hospital visit were the  different factors between success and failure on removal of ingested fish bone in  children.},

Methods to handle such problems continue to evolve offering advantages, such as the avoidance of surgery, reduced cost, improved visualization, reduced morbidity, and high removal success rate. However, to date, no studies have evaluated the endoscopic management of FBs in Japan. AIM: To elucidate level of safety and efficacy in the endoscopic management of FBs and FBI. METHODS: A total of 215 procedures were performed at Keio University Hospital between November 2007 and August 2018. Data were collected from medical charts, and endoscopic details were collected from an endoscopic reporting system. Procedures performed with a flexible gastrointestinal endoscope were only taken into account. Patients who underwent a technique involving FB or FBI from the digestive tract were only included. Data on patient sex, patient age, outpatient, inpatient, FB type, FB location, procedure time, procedure type, removal device type, success, and technical complications were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Among the 215 procedures, 136 (63.3\%) were performed in old adults ({$\geq$} 60 years), 180 (83.7\%) procedures were performed in outpatients. The most common type of FBs were press-through-pack (PTP) medications [72 (33.5\%) cases], FBI [47 (21.9\%)], Anisakis parasite (AP) [41 (19.1\%) cases]. Most FBs were located in the esophagus [130 (60.5\%) cases] followed by the stomach [68 (31.6\%) cases]. AP was commonly found in the stomach [39 (57.4\%) cases], and it was removed using biopsy forceps in 97.5\% of the cases. The most common FBs according to anatomical location were PTP medications (40\%) and dental prostheses (DP) (40\%) in the laryngopharynx, PTP (48.5\%) in the esophagus, AP (57.4\%) in the stomach, DP (37.5\%) in the small intestine and video capsule endoscopy device (75\%) in the colon. A transparent cap with grasping forceps was the most commonly used device [82 (38.1\%) cases]. The success rate of the procedure was 100\%, and complication were observed in only one case (0.5\%). CONCLUSION: Endoscopic management of FBs and FBI in our Hospital is extremely safe and effective.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: About 90\% of perianal infection is caused by cryptoglandular infection. Only a few cases of peritonitis or intra-abdominal abscesses secondary  to perforation of the digestive tract by an ingested foreign body have been  reported. The most common sites of impaction and perforation include the  appendix, cecum and the terminal ileum. The rectum is an unusual site of foreign  body impaction. This report intends to highlight that ingested foreign body  impacted in the rectum is an extremely rare cause of perianal abscess and  subsequent fistula in infants. CASE SUMMARY: Two cases of perianal abscess and  fistula due to ingested jujube pit impacted in the rectum are reported. Both  cases are infants with free previous medical history suffered from recurrent  perianal infection. The caregivers of the two patients denied ingestion of a  foreign body or any history of trauma. Physical examination combined with  ultrasound or computed tomography scan established the diagnosis. Both of the  patients underwent operation under general anesthesia. In case 1, a jujube pit  with sharp ends was discovered embedded within a subcutaneous fistula. The jujube  pit was then removed intact along with fistula resection. The wound was  successfully laid open to allow healing by secondary intention. In case 2, a  jujube pit was found with its sharp end puncturing the rectum, surrounded by pus  and necrotic tissue. Subsequent incision and adequate drainage were performed.  The whole jujube pit was then removed from the abscess cavity at the same time.  Both patients received colonoscopy to rule out inflammatory bowel disease or  other potential damages by the ingested jujube pit. The postoperative period was  uneventful. At 1.5 year follow-up, no recurrent abscess or fistula were found in  either patient. CONCLUSION: An impacted foreign body must not be overlooked as an  unusual cause of perianal abscess and fistula, especially in young children.},

This retrospective study evaluated the 10-year experience of a single hospital in China performing emergency removal of ingested foreign bodies in 586 adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2011 and 2020, medical records of 642 adults with a diagnosis of foreign bodies ingestion were retrospectively screened. The timing of endoscopic intervention was classified according to ESGE recommendations. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS We included 586 patients. The median (range) diameter of foreign bodies was 2.5 (1-24) cm: for sharp ones it was 2.5 (1.5-4.0) cm and for long ones it was 16.9 (10-24) cm. The most common site of foreign body lodgment was the esophagus (n=481; 82.1\%); 45.6\% (n=252) received emergent removal within 6 hours, while 32.2\% (n=178) underwent urgent removal within 24 hours. There were 583 (99.5\%) foreign bodies removed successfully and the complication rate was 17.9\%. Major complications occurred in 45 patients (7.7\%). Female sex and non-emergent endoscopy after 6 hours were significantly associated with a higher overall complications rate. For major complications, older age, time interval {$>$}24 hours, and sharper objects were associated with major complications. CONCLUSIONS The findings from this retrospective study support the ESGE statement that endoscopic removal of ingested foreign bodies from the upper GI tract within 6 hours reduces complication rates for adults in the emergency setting.},

  abstract = {Background. Although the clinical importance of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) has received increasing recognition, relatively little is known about its epidemiology. The objective of this study was to estimate the lifetime prevalence of NSSI in adults and its association with sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric disorders, and lifetime treatment for NSSI. Methods. A nationally representative face-to-face survey was conducted with 7192 adults aged {$\geq$}18 years in England. Respondents were interviewed about engagement in NSSI, psychiatric illness, suicidal thoughts and behavior, and treatment history for this behavior. Results. The estimated lifetime prevalence rate of NSSI was 4.86\%. Younger age, growing up without biological parents in the household, being unmarried, and impoverished backgrounds were associated with NSSI. The majority of respondents with lifetime NSSI (63.82\%) had at least one current psychiatric disorder. Most psychiatric conditions were associated with greater odds of lifetime NSSI in multivariate models. NSSI was strongly associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, respectively, even after accounting for psychiatric disorders and sociodemographic covariates. A substantial proportion of respondents with NSSI history (30.92\%) have engaged in medically severe self-harm, as indexed by requiring medical attention for this behavior. The majority of respondents with NSSI (56.20\%) had not received psychiatric care for this behavior. Conclusions. NSSI is prevalent in the general population and associated with considerable psychiatric comorbidity. A high rate of unmet treatment needs is evident among those with this behavior. Those at the greatest lifetime risk for NSSI may also be particularly limited in their resources to cope with this behavior.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist which effectively blocks heroin effects. Since opioid dependence treatment with naltrexone tablets suffers from high dropout rates, several depot injections and implants are under investigation. Sustained-release formulations are claimed to be effective, but a systematic review of the literature is lacking. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of sustained-release naltrexone for opioid dependence and its adverse effects in different study populations. Search methods The following databases were searched from their inception to November 2007: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, trial database at http://clinicaltrials.gov, available NIDA monographs, CPDD and AAAP conference proceedings. The reference lists of identified studies, published reviews and relevant web sides were searched manually. Study authors and drug companies were contacted to obtain any unpublished material or missing data. Selection criteria To evaluate effectiveness only RCTs were included. To evaluate safety, any clinical trial reporting adverse effects was assessed. Treatment condition was extended to include alcohol dependent subjects and healthy volunteers. Data collection and analysis Reviewers independently evaluated the reports, rated methodological quality and extracted data. Analyses were performed separately for opioid dependent, alcohol dependent and healthy participants. Main results Foe effectiveness, one report met inclusion criteria. Two dosages of naltrexone depot injections (192 and 384 mg) were compared to placebo. High-dose significantly increased days in treatment compared to placebo (WMD 21.00, 95\% CI 10.68 to 31.32, p{$<$}0.0001). High-dose compared to low-dose significantly increased days in treatment (WMD 12.00, 95\% CI 1.69 to 22.31, p=0.02). Number of patients retained in treatment did not show significant differences between groups. For adverse effects, seventeen reports met inclusion criteria analyses, six were RCTs. Side effects were significantly more frequent in naltrexone depot groups compared to placebo. In alcohol dependent samples only, adverse effects appeared to be significantly more frequent in the low-dose naltrexone depot groups compared to placebo (RR 1.18, 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.36, p=0.02). In the opioid dependent sample, group differences were not statistically significant. Reports on systematic assessment of side effects and adverse events were scarce. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of sustained-release naltrexone for treatment of opioid dependence.  For naltrexone injections, administration site-related adverse effects appear to be frequent, but of moderate intensity and time limited. For a harm-benefit evaluation of naltrexone implants, more data on side effects and adverse events are needed. Plain language summary People with opioid dependence require substantial therapeutic effort to keep them drug free. Their use of illicit opioids can be reduced and retention in treatment improved with supervised agonist replacement therapy with methadone, which is a highly addictive drug. Naltrexone is a long-acting, opioid-antagonist that blocks heroin effects. It is used to prevent relapse of both opioid and alcohol dependence. Highly motivated people do best with  naltrexone. Most opioid users are sceptical about treatment with naltrexone tablets and many drop out early on. Dropouts can be reduced with supervised tablet taking, offering incentives and using sustained-release naltrexone  such as subcutaneous implants or depot injections.  There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of sustained-release naltrexone. In the one controlled study that met inclusion criteria, 60 outpatients were randomised to one of three groups that received two sequential depot injections of naltrexone (192 or 384 mg) or placebo injections. The mean dropout time was 48 days with high dose naltrexone compared with 27 days on placebo; an increase in  treatment of 21 days (range 11 to 31 days). The lower depot dose gave a lesser benefit. The number retained in treatment at eight weeks did not show a clear difference and ranged from a mean of 68\% to 39\% of participants in  the different groups. 'Wanting heroin' did not differ on naltrexone but 'needing heroin' scored significantly lower with depot naltrexone compared to placebo. The most prominent adverse effects were general symptoms of  fatigue and pain at the injection site. Seventeen reports met inclusion criteria for assessing adverse effects. Seven looked specifically at naltrexone implants for treatment of opioid dependence and wound infection, allergic reaction to the implant and number of implants removed. The majority of the trials did not have a control group and systematic assessment of adverse effects was lacking.},

This review will focus on  the clinical presentation and complications of these two common inadvertent  ingestions in children, as well as recent regulatory efforts and advocacy  opportunities. RECENT FINDINGS: The rising incidence of cannabis toxicity in  children has corresponded with its legalization across several countries in the  last decade. Inadvertent pediatric cannabis intoxication is most commonly due to  the ingestion of edible forms discovered by children in their own home. The  clinical presentation can be nonspecific, therefore clinicians should have a low  threshold for including it on their differential diagnosis. Button battery  ingestions are also increasing in incidence. While many children are asymptomatic  at presentation, button battery ingestions can quickly cause esophageal injury  and lead to several serious and potentially life-threatening complications.  Prompt recognition and removal of esophageal button batteries is essential for  reducing harm. SUMMARY: Cannabis and button battery ingestions are important for  physicians who take care of children to recognize and manage appropriately. Given  their rising incidence, there are many opportunities for policy improvements and  advocacy efforts to make a difference in preventing these ingestions altogether.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We present our experience with an as yet undescribed type of intentionally ingested metallic foreign body that was specially designed to  arrest in its passage and cause perforation of the gastrointestinal tract. The  two halves of a standard paper clip are tied crosswise with a rubber band,  forming an elastic "cross." With its branches squeezed to lie parallel, the cross  is wrapped into a small strip of paper and ingested. After being released from  its wrapper, the branches of the cross spring back to their original position and  cause perforation of the bowel wall. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: University  hospital, Bulgaria. PATIENTS: Five male prisoners from the same jail undergoing  laparotomy for foreign body removal during 1 week in January 1994. INTERVENTIONS:  Laparotomy, removal of the foreign bodies through incisions of the bowel wall,  immediate restoration of the gastrointestinal tract continuity, and peritoneal  lavage and drainage. OUTCOME MEASURES: Morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Two of  the patients were initially observed but subsequently underwent surgery for  perforations of the gastrointestinal tract. Three of the patients underwent  immediate operative treatment. There were 20 total crosses ingested; all foreign  objects impacted and perforated the stomach (50\%), first duodenal portion (25\%),  and fourth duodenal portion (20\%). There was no morbidity or mortality among the  five patients treated. CONCLUSIONS: Because ingested crosses that have been  released from their wrappers never move distally, the only definitive solution is  to operate early.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical presentation of children with either an unwitnessed or witnessed esophageal foreign body.  METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed. Patients were identified using  ICD-9 code for esophageal foreign body. Clinical data and management techniques,  along with complications were abstracted. RESULTS: For the 5-year period of  review, 255 patients were identified with an esophageal foreign body. 214  children had a witnessed ingestion. The mean age of the unwitnessed ingestion  group was 2.3 years, compared to 4.6 years for a witnessed ingestion. In both  groups, males and females were distributed equally and the most common ingested  object was a coin. Bivariate, unadjusted analysis revealed that history of wheeze  (OR, 4.35) and fever (OR, 11.15) had the largest association with patients who  had an unwitnessed ingestion. Multivariate analysis indicated that any physical  findings of wheeze, rhonchi, stridor, or retractions were associated  significantly with a diagnosis of an unwitnessed foreign body. Children less than  2 years of age and with a documented fever are also predictive of an unwitnessed  ingestion. Eleven children (4.3\%) with esophageal abnormalities were also noted  to have foreign bodies. CONCLUSIONS: Children who present to the emergency  department two years old and younger, who have a documented fever and with  respiratory findings should be considered at risk for having a retained  esophageal foreign body. Children with esophageal abnormalities may also be at  risk for retained esophageal foreign bodies.},

This is particularly true when they lead to self-injurious  behavior that can only be prevented by either limiting the freedom of the  adolescent or forcing treatments on them that they do not want. Intentional and  repeated foreign-body ingestion (FBI) in youth is a poorly understood  self-injurious behavior that can be life-threatening. It poses unique clinical  and ethical challenges. Ingestion of sharp or magnetic objects increases the need  for endoscopic retrieval or surgical intervention with associated risks,  including perforation and anesthesia-related adverse events. When behavior  modification efforts fail to prevent recurrent FBI, the cumulative risk of  medical intervention mounts. Sometimes, as a last resort, doctors consider  surgical procedures that limit jaw movement and may physically prevent recurrent  FBI. In this Ethics Rounds article, we present a case in which doctors consider  whether it is in the best interest of a teenager with this behavior to undergo  orthodontic jaw wiring as a next step in treatment of repeated FBI.

In contrast, recurrent and intentional FBI (RIFBI) is  infrequent and associated with greater endoscopic and surgical intervention in  adults. Although pediatric guidelines exist for FBI, the risk and therapeutic  implications of RIFBI are not addressed. An anonymous international survey on  pediatric gastroenterologist experience with RIFBI was distributed. METHODS: A  33-item REDCap{\copyright} survey was distributed via email to pediatric gastroenterologists  identified through mailing and email lists obtained from pediatric  gastroenterology professional organizations. RESULTS: During 9-12/2021 we accrued  202 completed surveys. Respondents were from 27 countries and across the career  span. Eighty percent reported experience with RIFBI; 74\% reported seeing\,{$\leq$}\,3  patients with RIFBI within the past 24 months and 4\% reported seeing\,{$\geq$}\,6. Of  those who treated RIFBI, 38\% reported an average number of annual ingestions per  patient was {$\geq$}5. Frequent morbidity but not mortality was reported. Half reported  adherence to FBI guidelines. Later-career endoscopists treated RIFBI more  aggressively than accidental ingestion. Ninety-six percent noted that patients  with RIFBI had psychiatric comorbidities. Providers at academic medical centers  reported referring to behavioral health more than those in other settings.  CONCLUSION: Most gastroenterologists surveyed reported encountering RFBI several  times a year and in patients with psychiatric comorbidities. Greater likelihood  of adverse outcomes associated with endoscopy was reported. Most reported  referral to behavioral health and few had RIFBI management protocols. A broader  spectrum of psychologic comorbidities in the pediatric population with RIFBI,  notably depression and autism spectrum disorder, were reported.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Gastrointestinal bleeding refers to loss of blood from any site of the digestive tract. In paediatric clinical practice, it is usually a complaint of children attending the emergency department as a symptom of diseases such as ulcers, gastric or oesophageal varices, gastritis, Mallory-Weiss tears, anorectal fissures, allergic colitis, infectious colitis, intussusception, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and Meckel's diverticulum; it also occurs with high incidence in critically ill children hospitalised in intensive care units and is caused by stress-induced gastropathy. No matter what the cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, fasting is believed to be necessary due to the fear that eating may affect haemostasis or aggravate bleeding. Objectives To assess the effects and safety of fasting for haemostasis in gastrointestinal bleeding in children. Search methods We searched EBM Reviews - the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (May 2016), Ovid MEDLINE(R) (1946 to 3 May 2016), EMBASE (1980 to 2016 Week 18), Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1978 to 3 May 2016), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to 3 May 2016), VIP Database (1989 to 4 May 2016) and Wanfang Data (1990 to 4 May 2016). We used no restrictions on language or study setting and limited searches in CNKI and Wanfang Data to the medical field. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs in children with gastrointestinal bleeding that compared fasting with feeding. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the literature search results, and there were no disagreements. Main results We identified no RCTs or quasi-RCTs that compared the effects and safety of fasting with feeding for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding. No study fulfilled the criteria for considering studies for our review. Authors' conclusions There is currently no information available from RCTs or quasi-RCTs to support or refute the use of fasting for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding. Plain language summary Fasting for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding Review question To determine the effects and safety of fasting for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding. Background Gastrointestinal bleeding refers to loss of blood from any site of the digestive tract. If the bleeding site is near the ligament of Treitz (the muscle extending from the junction of the duodenum and jejunum to the diaphragm), it is described as upper gastrointestinal bleeding. If the bleeding site is away from the ligament of Treitz, it is described as lower gastrointestinal bleeding. People with a small amount of blood loss may have no symptoms, and have bloody vomiting or see blood in the stool with increased bleeding. Chronic mild gastrointestinal bleeding can lead to anaemia, causing fatigue or pallor; acute massive gastrointestinal bleeding can be life-threatening. Gastrointestinal bleeding has two scenarios in children. The first is a complaint of attending the emergency department as a symptom of diseases such as ulcers, gastritis, Mallory-Weiss tears, anorectal fissures, allergic colitis, infectious colitis, intussusception, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and Meckel's diverticulum. The second occurs in critically ill children hospitalised in intensive care units and is caused by stress-induced gastropathy. The incidence of the first scenario has not been well established, but there are substantial cases in paediatric intensive care units in the second scenario. Whatever the cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, fasting is believed to be necessary due to the fear that eating may affect haemostasis or aggravate bleeding. Study characteristics We searched EBM Reviews- Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (May 2016), Ovid MEDLINE(R) (1946 to 3 May 2016), EMBASE (1980 to 2016 Week 18), Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1978 to 3 May 2016), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to 3 May 2016), VIP Database (1989 to 4 May 2016) and Wanfang Data (1990 to 4 May 2016). We used no restrictions on language or study setting and limited searches in CNKI and Wanfang Data to medical field. We did not find any randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials providing information about the effects and safety of fasting for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding. Key results A randomised study is required to compare the effects and safety of fasting with feeding for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding, especially for critically ill children, who are at high risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.},

Most ingested sharp metallic bodies pass through the digestive tract spontaneously and patients can be managed conservatively.

It is hard to localize ingested sewing needles because they tend to scatter widely in the digestive tract and are impalpable manually. We report a psychiatric patient who ingested six sewing needles: one intact needle was found at the larynx, one had penetrated into the stomach, one was in the duodenum, one was in the cecum, one was broken into two pieces, and the final needle was broken into three pieces. All of the broken fragments were in the colon. The needle at the larynx was removed by a laryngoscope.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to validate the usefulness of MDCT for diagnosis of a sharp or pointed esophageal foreign body according to esophageal  level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with a history of sharp or  pointed foreign body ingestion were reviewed retrospectively. Two observers  interpreted the CT and the conventional radiography datasets separately. If a  foreign body was directly identified, it was regarded as a positive finding. Even  if no high-density foreign body was found, detection of a secondary finding was  considered to be a positive finding. Diagnostic performance of MDCT and  conventional radiography were compared according to esophageal level. Final  diagnosis was made by esophagoscopy or surgery in addition to the  clinicoradiologic result. RESULTS: MDCT was statistically superior to  conventional radiography for diagnosis of a thoracic esophageal foreign body for  both observers (p {$<$} 0.001 for each). No significant difference in sensitivity  between CT and conventional radiography for diagnosis of cervical esophageal  foreign body was noted regardless of observer. Both observers could identify all  complicated conditions with MDCT regardless of esophageal level. However, in two  of three cases of complicated thoracic esophageal foreign bodies, neither  observer could detect foreign bodies on conventional radiography; furthermore,  the observers could not identify pneumomediastinum. CONCLUSION: In cases of sharp  or pointed foreign body ingestion, if the result of an initial inspection of oro-  and hypopharynx reveals negative findings, the first imaging modality should be  MDCT for better diagnosis and management.},

The types of foreign bodies ingested included metal objects such as pins and wires; bony objects such as chicken or fish bones; wooden splinters; and other bizarre pointed bodies.2.2. Seventy-three per cent of the perforations occurred in and around the ileocecal region, the remainder being distributed generally from the stomach to the rectum.3.3. Six cases of perforation of the intestine with a hernial sac were reported.4.4. Duration of symptoms ranged from a few hours to two weeks in 50 per cent of the cases. The remainder of the cases had longer histories.5.5. Types of pathology observed were classified into five groups: early localized peritonitis, inflammatory masses, abscesses, general peritonitis and hemorrhage.6.6.

METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted on all patients (527) who were admitted with esophageal FB during a period of 9 years from January 1992 to January 2000. Two major referral hospitals were involved: the Princess Basma and Al-Bashir hospitals. A data sheet was constructed in which we included: name, age, gender, presenting symptoms, type and site of FB, technique of removal, and complications if present. RESULTS: Of the 527 patients 53\% were male and 47\% were female.77\% were children under the age of 10 years. In children coins were by far the most common FB to be found in the esophagus (68\%), while bones were the principal FB to be found in adults (8\%). In 89\%, the FB was found at the level of cricopharyngeal muscle. Drooling of saliva (72\%), dysphagia (71\%), and vomiting (24\%) were the most commonly presenting symptoms. Both rigid esophagoscopy and Magill forceps techniques were used to remove the FB from the esophagus. The complication rate was 2\% which included: esophageal perforation and mediastinitis, esophageal stenosis and esophageal erosions. CONCLUSION: The pattern of esophageal FB in Jordan is not different from other countries.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Intentional multiple drugs overdose is an often-encountered method of self-harm in adolescence. Treatments include supportive therapy, antidotes (when available) and decontamination techniques with the aim of reducing drugs absorption by the gastrointestinal system to minimize toxicity. Nevertheless, the decontamination techniques currently used, such as gastric lavage (GL), activated charcoal or whole-bowel irrigation, have a questionable effectiveness. Endoscopic gastric decontamination (EGD) treatment for massive ingestion of drugs or formation of pharmacobezoars is currently described only in anecdotal cases. Here we describe the management of an intentional drug overdose in an adolescent patient treated with EGD and the effects of this therapy on drugs pharmacokinetics. Case report: A 15-year-old boy was admitted in an unconscious state (Glasgow Coma Scale: 7--8) to the pediatric intensive care unit after assuming an unspecified amount of quetiapine, aspirin, bisoprolol, fluoxetine, furosemide, alprazolam, and pregabalin pills. Rapid sequence intubation was immediately performed and then the patient was treated with symptomatic therapy and GL with minimal removal of gastric material. Accounting for the type of drugs, the time elapsed from oral assumption and the unknown quantity assumed, EGD was attempted with aim of removing potential aggregate of the drugs. Serial blood samples were taken before and after EGD to measure the plasma level of the drugs. A pharmacobezoar was found and was immediately removed with EGD. The results of the drug monitoring showed that quetiapine exceeded the toxic level reported in literature indicating that it may have been the drug assumed in higher quantity by our patient. PICU stay was uneventful, and the patient was transferred to the psychiatric ward after extubation. Discussion: Our case shows how GL is not effective in mitigating multidrug absorption especially drugs potentially inducing pharmacobezoars. Furthermore, based on our plasma drug monitoring, we believe that early EGD should be considered in all cases of massive pill intake, prolonged release drugs that can form pharmacobezoars or in cases where a life-threatening dose cannot be excluded.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To analyze the utility of helical computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of suspected upper esophageal foreign bodies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A  prospective study was performed on 36 patients (26 F, 10 M, mean age 70 years)  with a history of foreign body impaction. All had negative findings at indirect  laryngoscopy. Radiologic assessment included unenhanced helical CT and a barium  contrast study. Patients with positive findings were taken to esophagoscopy. All  patients had a posterior clinical surveillance. RESULTS: Twenty patients had both  normal CT and barium study and satisfactory clinical outcome. In 12 patients a  foreign body was noted in the cervical esophagus by CT, barium study, and  endoscopy. In one patient a fish bone was detected by CT (and not by barium)  confirmed with esophagoscopy. Another patient had a fish bone esophageal  perforation which was observed only by CT and confirmed at surgery. Two patients  with normal barium and endoscopy presented a false-positive CT result.  CONCLUSION: Barium swallow is currently the first radiologic study, but may  involve a risk of aspiration and can impede a subsequent esophagoscopy.  Esophagoscopy is an invasive technique with a certain risk of serious  complications that can be avoided with a satisfactory radiologic assessment. CT  is easy, fast, has 100\% sensitivity and is therefore the first choice technique  for diagnosing suspected upper esophageal foreign bodies not expected to be  visible on plain radiographs.},

The presence of the second coin was suspected only on review of the lateral cervical radiograph. In a previous report, failure to initially diagnose the presence of an additional coin resulted in an endoscopic failure to clear the esophagus. The technical aspects of Foley extraction are reviewed along with the controversy surrounding the procedure. Series totaling 294 cases document a cumulative success rate of 85\% without significant complications. The technique, when performed by airway experts, is concluded to be a viable alternative to endoscopic removal. Lateral films, fluoroscopic extraction, and barium studies in select cases are recommended as safeguards against missing nonobvious foreign bodies of the esophagus.},

  abstract = {Ingested or penetrating foreign bodies are common in veterinary medicine. When they are radiolucent, these objects become a diagnostic challenge, but they can  be investigated sonographically. However, successful object identification  depends on the skill of the sonographer. Considering that these cases appear  randomly during hospital routines, it is not always possible to train all  students to identify them correctly. Therefore, the aim of this study was to  produce homemade simulations of radiolucent foreign bodies for veterinary student  demonstrations that could be identified sonographically and to evaluate the  acceptability, applicability, and usefulness of these simulations according to a  visual analog scale questionnaire and subjective questions. For this purpose,  object models (a pacifier nipple, a toy ball, a sock, nylon thread, and a mango  seed) were designed, produced, and immersed in gelatin. To simulate wood  splinters in the integumentary and musculoskeletal system, a piece of meat  punctured with a toothpick and ice cream stick splinters were used. The type of  phantom had a determinant effect on the visualization (chi-square = 36.528, P {$<$}  0.0001) and recognition (chi-square = 18.756, P = 0.0021) capability of the  students. All of the students answered that their experience with the models  could help in real situations. The student responses to the questionnaire  indicated that the project was well accepted, and the participants believed that  this experience could be applicable to and useful in veterinary routines.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Recurrent intentional foreign body (RIFB) ingestion is a complex and costly issue among patients in prison and those with psychiatric disorders. Risk  factors for RIFB ingestion include male sex, incarceration, and the presence of a  psychiatric disorder. Most patients can be managed with observation and  endoscopy. Surgery is indicated in cases involving perforation or obstruction.  The literature on preventative strategies for RIFB ingestion is scarce. CASE  REPORT A 23-year-old man required 6 admissions in 1 calendar year for intentional  foreign body ingestions. The patient was living in prison and had a history of  bipolar I disorder, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. He  underwent 9 endoscopic procedures that retrieved a total of 64 objects. The  primary imaging modalities were abdominal X-ray and abdominopelvic  contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan. The patient was managed with  endoscopy and, in 2 cases, with observation alone. Serial abdominal examinations  and abdominal films were used to monitor the progress of foreign bodies that were  difficult to retrieve. A bowel regimen with polyethylene glycol facilitated the  passage of the objects. The patient never required surgical intervention. The  mean length of stay was 4.17 days. The recurrent ingestions may have been related  to compulsions and family stress. CONCLUSIONS Interdisciplinary collaboration is  paramount in formulating effective treatment plans and limiting recurrence.  Proposed strategies to prevent RIFB ingestion include the removal of ingestible  objects from the environment, specialized prison units for close monitoring,  early psychiatric intervention with appropriate pharmacologic/behavioral therapy,  and limiting hospital admissions to prevent secondary gain. Further studies are  needed to determine the most effective approach to manage and prevent RIFB  ingestion.},

The majority of accidentally  ingested foreign bodies pass through the alimentary tract without any  complications and rarely require intervention. Accidentally ingested foreign  bodies are usually fish bones, bones of other animals, and dentures. Oesophageal  food impaction is the commonest cause of oesophageal foreign bodies in the  Western hemisphere. Intentionally ingested foreign bodies may be organic or  inorganic, and often require intervention; these patients have either underlying  psychological or mental disease or are involved in illegal activities such as  body packing, which involves trafficking narcotics. Imaging plays a crucial role  in not only identifying the type, number and location of the foreign body but  also in excluding any complications. In this comprehensive pictorial review, we  provide an overview of the spectrum of foreign bodies ingested in adults,  emphasising the role of various imaging modalities, their limitations and common  foreign body mimickers on imaging.},

  abstract = {That chest wounds occur frequently and are of considerable importance can be seen from Table I, which analyses the frequency and the fatality rates of chest injuries in the recent wars.In forward areas the surgery of chest injuries is confined to emergency measures, such as the closing of sucking pneumothoraces and the relieving of tension pneumothoraces, etc., and is undertaken by the general surgeon, whilst the definitive surgery is performed by specialist surgeons at the base chest centres. Likewise, radiology in the forward areas is generally confined to scout films of the thorax, the special investigations being left to the radiologist at the special chest centres.In modern warfare, the radiological investigation of a chest wound falls into two main classes:---(a) At Advanced Surgical Centres and C.C.S'sFilms at this stage will generally be in the nature of scout films, to give a general estimation of the intra-thoracic damage. There is little place for complicated radiological examinations at this stage. Many of the patients are severely ill, often with multiple wounds, and as the portability of the apparatus (W.D. 85/15 unit) used of necessity limits its output, recourse to short distance technique must be made.Using this technique, the anode film distance may be reduced to 30 in. or even less, to eliminate movement. The resulting distortion is no bar to correct interpretation as the lesion, unfortunately, is seldom minimal, whilst on the other hand the slightest movement may obscure even the most massive of lesions.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: As part of a larger study of  the effects of retained lead bullets on blood lead, a retrospective review of  study findings was completed on 5 of 8 patients who sustained injuries to the  maxillofacial region. These 5 patients were recruited into the larger study  within 11 days of injury and showed a penetration path for the projectile that  engaged the upper aerodigestive tract. All subjects were recruited from patients  presenting for care of their gunshot injuries to a large inner-city trauma center  with a retained bullet resulting from a gunshot injury. An initial blood lead  level was measured for all recruited patients and repeated 1 to 17 weeks later.  Medical history was taken along with a screening and risk factor questionnaire to  determine other potential or actual sources (occupational/recreational) of lead  exposure. (109)Cd K-shell x-ray fluorescence determinations of bone lead were  completed to determine past lead exposure not revealed by medical history and  risk factor questionnaire. Radiographs taken of the abdomen and chest, required  as a part of the patient's hospital care, were retrospectively reviewed for signs  of metallic fragments along the aerodigestive tract. RESULTS: All 5 patients  retained multiple lead pellets or fragments at the site of injury, sustained  fractures of the facial bones, and showed increases in blood lead. Three of the 5  study subjects who sustained maxillofacial gunshot injuries involving the mouth,  nose, or throat region showed metallic densities along the gastrointestinal tract  indicative of ingested bullet fragments. Each patient with ingested bullet  fragments showed rapid elevation of blood lead exceeding 25 microg/dL and  sustained increases well beyond the time when all ingested fragments were  eliminated. A 3-year follow-up on these 3 patients showed significantly sustained  elevation of blood lead but less than that observed during the initial 6 months  after injury. None of the 5 study subjects showed any evidence of metallic  foreign bodies within the tracheobronchial regions indicative of aspiration.  CONCLUSION: Ingestion of lead fragments can result from gunshot injuries to the  maxillofacial region and may substantially contribute to a rapid increase in  blood lead level. Prompt diagnosis and elimination of ingested lead fragments are  essential steps necessary to prevent lead being absorbed from the  gastrointestinal tract. Increased blood lead in victims after gunshot injuries  must be fully evaluated for all potential sources, including recent environmental  exposure, absorption of lead from any remaining bullets in body tissues, and the  possibility of mobilization of lead from long-term body stores such as bone.},

The diagnosis of intestinal perforation  following blister ingestion is often delayed because of an unreliable history and  nonspecific clinical presentation. The purpose of this case report is to raise  awareness about a rare but difficult diagnosis and its importance in avoiding  potentially fatal events. CASE REPORT Herein, we describe successful cases of  surgical and endoscopic removal after blister ingestion. The first case was that  of a polymorbid 75-year-old man who presented with acute onset of abdominal pain  in the right upper quadrant and epigastric regions. No indication of the cause  was observed on initial computed tomography (CT). The patient developed an acute  abdomen, and emergency laparotomy was performed, during which 2 small  perforations were observed in the terminal ileum, and an empty tablet blister was  retrieved. The second patient was a 55-year-old man who presented with a  considerable lack of awareness. On the initial CT, a subdural hematoma,  aspiration, and an unidentified foreign body in the stomach were observed.  Gastroscopy was performed after emergency craniotomy. In addition to the initial  foreign body, a second object, which had gone unnoticed on the initial CT, was  found and removed from the esophagus. CONCLUSIONS With an increased risk of  perforation and difficult clinical and radiological diagnoses, prophylactic  measures and special awareness of high-risk patients are particularly important.},

This review discusses the anaesthetic potential risks and complications observed  with tattooing and piercing, their management and prevention. RECENT FINDINGS:  Airway management during anaesthesia is of particular interest with oral jewelry.  Patients often refuse to remove their piercing for fear of tract closure. There  are no serious complications reported after epidural puncture through a tattoo,  although any long-term consequence cannot be discarded yet. Even theoretical  concerns are more and more debated. SUMMARY: Oral and nasal piercing is of  particular concern because of the risks of swallowing and aspiration.  Consequently, patients should be advised to remove piercing before anaesthesia.  Emergency situations are especially risky and anaesthesiologists should be aware  of the piercing removal techniques. In case of piercing loss, radiographies and  fiberoptic endoscopy of the upper airways and digestive tracts should be  performed to eliminate aspiration or swallowing of the foreign body. Epidurals  should not be denied to parturients with lumbar tattooing. However, it seems  still prudent to avoid direct tattoo puncture or when unavoidable, to nick the  skin prior to inserting the needle through the tattoo.},

In adults, foreign body ingestion is more common in the elderly, individuals with mental illness or who have an intellectual disability, alcohol poisoning, prison inmates, and drug traffickers. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 22 year old male patient who presented with abdominal distension and vomiting of ingested matter of two to three episodes per day of one month duration. He is a known schizophrenic patient for the past three years and has been on follow up at a nearby hospital. He swallowed metallic nails in an attempt to kill himself. On abdominal examination there was distension, and epigastric tenderness. His plain abdominal x-ray showed multiple radiopaque foreign body in the stomach. Similarly, abdominal ultrasound showed thickened gastric wall and multiple linear foreign bodies in the stomach. Then, with the impression of gastric outlet obstruction secondary to foreign body in the stomach, laparotomy plus gastrotomy plus foreign body removal and repair were done under general anesthesia. Dilated stomach, palpable mass on distal stomach and first part of duodenum, and adhesion between stomach, abdominal wall and liver was found intra operatively. CONCLUSION: Passage of curved metal through the throat is a rare case. Mentally ill individuals need close follow up and physiological consultation.},

The natural propensities of living beings to pain and pleasure, being a subject of life, and having specific good and interest (as proposed by Singer, Regan, Tayler, and Goodpaster, respectively), have been taken as a reason to determine the moral status of the beings in question. This article makes the case that none of them can offer all-inclusive ideal for biocentrism to embrace all life forms as moral patients since they are either exclusive, hierarchical, or imprecise. To this end, I argue that it is possible to drive a unifying ideal from Schopenhauer's metaphysics: the will to live. The will to live is a quality that all living beings share, regardless of their abilities and propensities. Both conscious and unconscious beings, sentient and non-sentient creatures, lower animals and plants are the embodi\-ments or physical forms of the ultimate reality that is the will to live. Thus, biocentrism becomes more valid and effective in environmental preservation by incorporating the will to live into its ethical principle.},

  abstract = {Background/Aims: Intentional ingestion of foreign bodies is a frequent occurrence in the prison environment. The aim of this study is to describe the profile of inmates who have ingested foreign bodies, to determine the nature of these foreign bodies and to specify their management. Materials and Methods: Our retrospective and descriptive study focused' on 13 inmates having ingested' 47 foreign bodies and who consulted the emergency of our department over a 5-year period from January 2018 to July 2023. Results: The study population consisted of 12 men and one woman with an average age of 32 years (24 years-47 years). Foreign bodies ingested by inmates were dominated by batteries (59.52\%) followed by lighters (19.04\%). The majorit{\'y} of foreign bodies were, at the time of discovery, located mainly in the stomach (6 cases) and colon (4 cases). Ingestion resulted in epigastric pain (3 cases), externalized gastrointestinal bleeding with epigastralgia (2 cases), and no symptoms (8 cases). Of the 13 cases of foreign body ingestion, 6 patients underwent endoscopic extraction in the gastroenterology department. Extraction was by diathermic loop, dormia loop and endoscopic basket. Successful extraction was achieved in 4 cases (66.66\%), and unsuccessful extraction in 2 cases (33.33\%). Only one inmate required surgical extraction, and in 6 patients the elimination of foreign bodies in the stool was spontaneous under medical supervision. Conclusion: Foreign body ingestion is frequent and voluntary in the prison environment. It is characterized by the multiplicity of foreign bodies. The rate of successful extraction of ingested foreign bodies in our practice is satisfactory, requiring an experienced endoscopist to perform the extraction without complications and avoid recourse to surgery. Education of the prison population is important, and psychological follow-up is essential.},

The number of choking accidents has not decreased because its mechanism remains unclear; the manner in which such accidents occur cannot be observed. The purpose of this study is to visualize choking on toys by using a computer simulation, Swallow Vision (R), after creating a new child model of swallowing. An organ model for the simulation was created from the CT of a 9-month-old boy and videofluorographic images during swallowing for a 9-month-old girl. The organ models were defined as hyperelastic and contained particles that moved by forced displacement. The toy models were spheres with diameters of 10 and 15 mm and different coefficients of friction and restitution. The applied calculation method was the Hamiltonian Moving Particle Simulation. The results demonstrated that the simulation could visualize how a toy model obstructed the upper airway in the pharynx and larynx. Moreover, the ball size and the coefficients of friction and restitution affected the site obstructed. As choking accidents were successfully visualized using the Swallow Vision (R), The computer simulation is expected to advance research on understanding the choking mechanism.},

The majority of foreign bodies are  passed smoothly with no problems if they passed the esophagus, however some may  be lodged in areas of anatomical narrowing which may require endoscopic or  surgical intervention. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year -old mentally abnormal woman  presented to the emergency department complaining from abdominal pain for 2 days.  The family reported a history of ingestion of multiple metallic nails one week  before presentation. Abdominal examination showed generalized tenderness and  guarding. Plain abdominal X-ray showed multiple metallic nails in the upper  abdomen and the right lower abdomen. Laparotomy was performed, one of the nails  was causing perforation of the gastric wall, huge number of metallic nails were  extracted from the stomach and cecum, appendectomy was performed. CONCLUSION:  Ingestion of sharp and long foreign bodies usually requires surgical  intervention, after surgery close observation and psychological consultation is  required to prevent repeated ingestions.},

This study aims to report the exceptional case of a patient with a foreign body lodged in the ileocecal region revealed by sub-occlusive syndromes. The study involved a patient aged 22 years with no particular past medical history, presenting with K{\"o}nig's syndrome evolving in a context of alteration of the general state. Anatomopathological examination of surgical ileocecal specimen performed after inconclusive endoscopy, histologic examination of the biopsies and scannography, showed ileocecal thickening due to infammatory response to a foreign body. In the absence of anamnestic data, ileocecal foreign body poses a real problem of differential diagnosis including inflammatory, infectious and tumoral diseases of the ileocecal junction. The presence of a foreign body may be revealed by occlusive complications or perforations, hence the essential role of imaging. Endoscopy always plays a central diagnostic and therapeutic role in the management of ingested foreign bodies, thus reducing surgical morbidity (although it is sometimes unavoidable). Anatomopathological study shows foreign body granuloma. Cases of foreign body lodged in the ileocecal region have been rarely reported. Now they should be suspected in patients with any symptom, including ileocecal junction disorders, in order to avoid side effects and complications due to heavy treatments.},

This study is, therefore, one of a few that explores the phenomenon of NSSI among males who engage in this behavior in a correctional setting. The purpose of this article is to present the demographic and motivational factors of adult males who engage in NSSI in a correctional setting. The sample consisted of 42 adult males incarcerated in three New Mexico Prisons who had a history of NSSI. Of the participants, 40\% were Hispanic and 60\% were non-Hispanic. Three measures were used in this study: the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI), the Self-Injury Motivational Scale-II (SIMS-II), and a researcher-created demographic questionnaire. The DSHI was used to examine the types of self-harm, as well as the frequency, severity, and duration of each behavior. The SIMS-II explored 36 potential types of motivations or reasons for self-injurious behavior. Fifteen of the 16 forms of NSSI were endorsed by at least one of the participants. The most predominant type of NSSI reported was cutting (93\%), followed by head banging (78\%), and sticking oneself with sharp objects (71.4\%). Ninety-three percent of the participants required medical attention or hospitalization due to NSSI behaviors. Motivational factors associated with cutting were predominantly mood dysregulation, communication, and addictive qualities.},

The aim of this paper is to report the management and the outcomes in 414 patients admitted for suspected ingestion of foreign body between May 1995 and December 1999. METHODS: A plain radiographic film of the neck, chest or abdomen was obtained in the case of radiopaque objects, and in order to rule out suspected perforation: in such cases a computed tomography (CT) study was also performed. All patients were asked to give their informed consent, which was refused by three patients. Anesthesia was always used, either conscious sedation (86.8 \%), or general anesthesia in the case of poor patient tolerance (13.2 \%). All patients underwent an endoscopic procedure within six hours of admission. A flexible scope was used in all patients and a wide range of endoscopic devices was employed. RESULTS: Foreign bodies were found in 64.5 \% of our patients. Almost all were found in the esophagus. The types of foreign body were very different, but they were chiefly food boluses, bones or cartilages, dental prostheses or fish bones. In three patients (1.1 \%) it was impossible to endoscopically remove the foreign body, which was located in the cervical esophagus: all these three patients required surgery. No complications relating to the endoscopic procedure were observed, but 30.7 \% of patients had an underlying esophageal disease, such as a stricture. Only eight patients required a second endoscopic procedure, performed by a more experienced endoscopist. CONCLUSION: Foreign body ingestion represents a frequent reason for emergency endoscopy. The endoscopic procedure is a successful technique which allows the removal of the foreign bodies in almost all cases without significant complications. Surgery is rarely required.},

METHODS: A 30-month-old boy whose eye had been enucleated for  retinoblastoma swallowed his ocular prosthesis on 2 different occasions, and a  32-month-old boy whose eye had also been enucleated for retinoblastoma swallowed  his ocular prosthesis once. RESULTS: In the second child, an abdominal radiograph  was obtained, but the swallowed prosthesis was not apparent, and radiographic  imaging of the recovered prosthesis failed to demonstrate an identifiable object.  In each case, the prosthesis was recovered in the child's stool without incident  several weeks later. Neither child had physical complications as a result of the  swallowing events. CONCLUSIONS: We report 3 instances in which a child fitted for  an ocular prosthesis after enucleation swallowed his prosthesis and had no  untoward effects. The failure of imaging to detect the prostheses in the second  child is attributed to the radiolucent nature of materials used in the  manufacture of the prosthesis. Each of the children was having life stresses in  addition to his medical treatment that may have accounted for his behavior.},

Several new protocols for the infusion of acetylcysteine,  the antidote for paracetamol overdose, have been proposed in the past decade and  evaluated in clinical studies. The 12-hour Scottish and Newcastle Acetylcysteine  Protocol regimen and 20-hour Australian two-infusion bag protocol have been  widely adopted into clinical practice and endorsed in national guidelines because  of their shorter duration, reduction in adverse effects and efficacy in treating  overdose. This article includes a care pathway that can facilitate the  implementation of the Scottish and Newcastle Acetylcysteine Protocol.

  abstract = {Button batteries (BB) remain a health hazard to children as ingestion might lead to life-threatening complications, especially if the battery is impacted in the esophagus. Worldwide initiatives have been set up in order to prevent and also timely diagnose and manage BB ingestions. A European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) task force for BB ingestions has been founded, which aimed to contribute to reducing the health risks related to this event. It is important to focus on the European setting, next to other worldwide initiatives, to develop and implement effective management strategies. As one of the first initiatives of the ESPGHAN task force, this ESPGHAN position paper has been written. The literature is summarized, and prevention strategies are discussed focusing on some controversial topics. An algorithm for the diagnosis and management of BB ingestions is presented and compared to previous guidelines (NASPGHAN, National Poison Center). In agreement with earlier guidelines, immediate localization of the BB is important and in case of esophageal impaction, the BB should be removed instantly (preferably {$<$}2 hours). Honey and sucralfate can be considered in ingestions {$\leq$}12 hours while waiting for endoscopic removal but should not delay it. In case of delayed diagnosis (first confirmation of the BB on X-ray {$>$}12 hours after ingestion or time point of removal {$>$}12 hours after ingestion) and esophageal impaction the guideline suggests to perform a CT scan in order to evaluate for vascular injury before removing the battery. In delayed diagnosis, even if the battery has passed the esophagus, endoscopy to screen for esophageal damage and a CT scan to rule out vascular injury should be considered even in asymptomatic children. In asymptomatic patients with early diagnosis ({$\leq$}12 hours after ingestion) and position of the BB beyond the esophagus, one can monitor with repeat X-ray (if not already evacuated in stool) in 7 to 14 days, which is different from previous guidelines where repeat X-ray and removal is recommended after 2--4 days and is also based on age. Finally, prevention strategies are discussed in this paper.},

In the present retrospective study, we have tried to analyze the incidence of impacted foreign body in the upper digestive tract at our center. The most frequent presentation is history of foreign body ingestion or aspiration. They are chiefly produced by accidental swallowing of the foreign body in the extremes of age and deliberate attempts in case of psychiatric and criminal background subjects. Varied manifestations of dysphagia, drooling of saliva and retro-sternal pain is presented. Additional symptoms of vomiting and subjective sensation of breathlessness are present occasionally. Removal of foreign body at times is a challenge for the gastrointestinal endoscopist. If not intervened expeditiously, can lead to horrific outcome. In our review study, rigid endoscopy resolved the problem in majority of cases by removal of the foreign body or dislodgement of the impacted fleshy meat ball in to the stomach. We report a retrospective study of incident and types of impacted foreign body in the upper digestive tract. The study was carried out at a Tertiary Care Center at Gangtok, India, spread over 5 years. The review of the case details was tabulated and the incidence types and outcome was calculated to review the clinical condition and its management.},

We present a case of multifactorial severe hypophosphatemia in the setting of chronic alcoholism and presumed refeeding syndrome. Case Description: A 69 year old male with a history of alcohol use disorder presented to the ED with generalized muscle weakness, recurrent falls and confusion. He reported consuming 2 bottles of wine daily for several years, with his last drink 24 hours prior to presentation. He reported a history of caloric restriction with intentional weight loss followed by a recent increase in caloric intake in the preceding week. His initial presentation was consistent with sepsis from contained sigmoid perforation due to foreign body ingestion, likely a chicken bone. Labs revealed phosphorus {$<$} 1, potassium 2.0, magnesium 1.4, lactate 8.5, WBC 6.1 with 34\% band neutrophils, mild alkalosis (venous pH 7.43), pCO(2) 42, HCO(3) 24. He was admitted to the ICU and received volume resuscitation, IV antibiotics, management of alcohol withdrawal, intravenous phosphate, potassium and magnesium. Repeat labs showed improved phosphorus to 1.9, however serum corrected calcium decreased from 9.5 to 7.5 mg/dL. He continued to receive further repletion of electrolytes with eventual normalization. Discussion: The etiology of this patient's severe hypophosphatemia was multifactorial from chronic alcoholism and refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome was likely present in this case given the patient's malnutrition and weight loss with recent significantly increased caloric intake resulting in severe hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. His generalized muscle weakness can be explained by alcoholism and severe electrolyte derangements. Fortunately, he did not develop respiratory failure which is a complication of severe hypophosphatemia as a result of decreased intracellular ATP. For patients with severe hypophosphatemia ({$<$} 1 mg/dL), IV phosphate repletion is recommended with level monitoring every six hours. This patient developed hypocalcemia in the setting of phosphate repletion, which is a known complication and should be monitored closely.},

A 28-year-old pregnant woman, at term, shot  herself intravaginally with a toy BB gun. Following a spontaneous precipitous  vaginal delivery, the neonate presented with persistent seizure disorder,  meningitis, cerebritis, and a right parietal region scalp swelling. Imaging  studies revealed intracranial hemorrhage, and the metallic pellet was adjacent to  the right lateral ventricle, which was removed through a parietal craniotomy.

  abstract = {Esophageal perforations and postoperative leaks are challenging and life -threatening conditions, with a not well-defined management, yet. Perforation is defined as a full -thickness tear in the esophageal wall due to a trauma on the esophageal lumen or to a sudden increase of endoluminal pressure, like in spontaneous perforations. The most frequent causes are: iatrogenic injuries, spontaneous perforations, foreign body or caustic ingestion, trauma, tumors etc. The onset of symptoms varies depending on the location of perforation (cervical, intrathoracic or intraabdominal), the degree of tissue destruction and extension of contamination of surrounding organs, the cause, the timing of diagnosis and the presence of underlying esophageal disorders. Post -operative esophageal leaks have a different origin but a quite similar clinical presentation and treatment to esophageal perforations. The higher reported incidence is after cervical esophagogastric anastomosis, followed by intrathoracic anastomosis (above all after trans-hiatal one). It is already proven that short diagnostic timing and correct treatment can reduce mortality of 50\%. Recent evidence also shows how better outcomes are achieved when the management is multidisciplinary, led by an expert team, and individualized treatments are adopted, involving all available modalities (medical, endoscopic and surgical). The purpose of this article is to review current standard practice, expert opinions and outcomes in the management of esophageal perforations and postoperative leaks.},

We reviewed retrospectively the patients' documents, radiological  reports, operative findings and outcome. We also performed a literature search  for all reports of multiple magnets ingestion on MEDLINE and EMBASE. RESULTS:  Daily abdominal radiographs to monitor migration of magnetic objects together  with clinical examination revealed early detection of perforations in two  patients. Explorative laparoscopy and suturing of perforations resulted in a  rapid recovery and good cosmetic appearance. Literature search resulted in 44  published articles with a total of 52 cases of multiple magnet ingestion in  children. CONCLUSIONS: This report stresses the need for prompt follow-up and  early detection of complications in order to operate those patients without  delay. Laparoscopy is the method of choice in exploring the abdomen when  perforation is suspected.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Fractures of the mandible (lower jaw) are a common occurrence and usually related to interpersonal violence or road traffic accidents. Mandibular fractures may be treated using open (surgical) and closed (non-surgical) techniques. Fracture sites are immobilized with intermaxillary fixation (IMF) or other external or internal devices (i.e. plates and screws) to allow bone healing. Various techniques have been used, however uncertainty exists with respect to the specific indications for each approach. Objectives The objective of this review is to provide reliable evidence of the effects of any interventions either open (surgical) or closed (non-surgical) that can be used in the management of mandibular fractures, excluding the condyles, in adult patients. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 28 February 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 28 February 2013), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 28 February 2013),  meta Register of Controlled Trials (to 7 April 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (to 7 April 2013) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 7 April 2013). The reference lists of all trials identified were checked for further studies. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials evaluating the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. Any studies that compared different treatment approaches were included. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Results were to be expressed as random-effects models using mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes with 95\% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was to be investigated to include both clinical and methodological factors. Main results Twelve studies, assessed as high (six) and unclear (six) risk of bias, comprising 689 participants (830 fractures), were included. Interventions examined different plate materials and morphology; use of one or two lag screws; microplate versus miniplate; early and delayed mobilization; eyelet wires versus Rapid IMF™ and the management of angle fractures with intraoral access alone or combined with a transbuccal approach. Patient-oriented outcomes were largely ignored and post-operative pain scores were inadequately reported. Unfortunately, only one or two trials with small sample sizes were conducted for each comparison and outcome. Our results and conclusions should therefore be interpreted with caution. We were able to pool the results for two comparisons assessing one outcome. Pooled data from two studies comparing two miniplates versus one miniplate revealed no significant difference in the risk of post-operative infection of surgical site (risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95\% CI 0.41 to 4.22, P = 0.64, I 2  = 0\%). Similarly, no difference in post-operative infection between the use of two 3-dimensional (3D) and standard (2D) miniplates was determined (RR 1.26, 95\% CI 0.19 to 8.13, P = 0.81, I 2  = 27\%). The included studies involved a small number of participants with a low number of events. Authors' conclusions This review illustrates that there is currently inadequate evidence to support the effectiveness of a single approach in the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. The lack of high quality evidence may be explained by clinical diversity, variability in assessment tools used and difficulty in grading outcomes with existing measurement tools. Until high level evidence is available, treatment decisions should continue to be based on the clinician's prior experience and the individual circumstances. Plain language summary Treatments for fractures of the lower jaw Review question The lower jaw (also known as the mandible) is an important bone that shapes the face, holds the lower teeth in place and is used to move the mouth, for talking and chewing food. Fractures are most often found in the part of the lower jaw that supports teeth (known as the body), the part where the jaw curves upwards into the neck (the angle), or at the knobbly-shaped joint found at the very top of the jaw bone (the condyle). Available treatments align and stabilize the fracture, allowing the bone to heal in the proper position. Treatments may or may not involve surgery. This review, produced by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, examines different methods for treating fractures of the body and angle of the mandible in existing research and studies. Background People of all ages can fracture their lower jaw, but fractures mainly occur as a result of violence (for example, being hit or punched in the jaw) or by being involved in an accident on the road (for example, car crashes or bicycle accidents). These fractures can be stabilized by physically binding the jaw shut with a system of bars, wires or elastic bands (intermaxillary fixation), or by using tiny screws or plates attached directly to the fractured sections of the lower jaw bone whilst still allowing the mouth to open (rigid fixation). Study characteristics The evidence on which this review is based is up to date as of 28 February 2013. Twelve studies with a combined total of 689 participants were included in this review. Participants ranged in age from 16 to 68 years and most participants (90\%) were male. All of the studies compared different types of surgical treatments, and each study evaluated a different aspect of surgical treatment such as different types of plates, screws, or wires or how long the jaw was immobilized after surgery. Key results There were concerns about the design and quality of all the studies. All the studies evaluated different aspects of surgical treatment. None of the studies evaluated non-surgical treatments such as intermaxillary fixation and no study compared surgical treatment with non-surgical treatment. As a result there is no clear evidence to indicate which approach is the best to manage these fractures. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence found is poor. Recommendations are made for further well-conducted research studies in this area to be undertaken.},

The phenomenology of this behavior, as well as its psychiatric and medical complications are discussed. It is probable that chronic nicotinism contributed to this patient's refractoriness to psychiatric treatment and to his eventual cardiovascular crisis. The occurrence of pica as a manifestation of severe psychopathology was vividly described by the early pioneers of neuropsychiatry, but has received little attention in recent psychiatric literature. This is in marked contrast to the syndrome of psychogenic water intoxication which continues to be reported frequently. The majority of descriptions of pica have dealt with its occurrence in children, in pregnant women, and as a societal practice in certain cultures studied from a medico-anthropologic point of view. The toxic organic brain syndrome caused by chronic ingestion of nicotine-containing products has also been neglected in psychiatric publications. Descriptions of the neuropsychiatric complications of subacute and chronic nicotinism have been restricted to textbooks of toxicology, where greater emphasis has been given to the acute effects of large quantities of nicotine, often in forms other than tobacco. The following case illustrates the near-fatal practice of tobacco pica in a psychotic patient and dramatically demonstrates the systemic and central nervous system effects of nicotinism.},

  abstract = {The term pulmonary aspiration complex represents the various types of pulmonary aspiration based on the nature of the material aspirated. Pulmonary aspiration continues to be an ever-threatening clinical problem even though knowledge of lung defense mechanisms and predisposing factors of aspiration has been advanced to a point which allows identification of patients at risk of suffering pulmonary aspiration. The identification of patients at risk however has not permitted adequate preventive measures from being exercised. This problem persists in part because few of the predisposing factors are reversible or controllable to a degree which would preclude pulmonary aspiration. In addition, the clinical diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration is more often tentative than absolute and based on the clinical setting and changes demonstrated on serial chest radiographs. This situation emphasizes the role of the radiologist and his knowledge of radiographic findings in pulmonary aspiration in suggesting the diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration. The diagnosis may then be confirmed by additional chest radiographs or by bronchoscopy and the retrieval of the aspirated material. An understanding of the pathophysiology of the types of pulmonary aspiration serves to increase the awareness of certain pulmonary complications from aspiration, to select appropriate diagnostic studies, and to institute specific therapy. However, the nature of the material aspirated by a patient may not be obvious initially unless the episode is witnessed and may only be determined in retrospect in some cases. Thus, radiologists play a primary role in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration. Frequently, radiologists must integrate the chest radiographic findings of pulmonary aspiration---the distribution, types of parenchymal opacities, and the expected temporal changes in these opacities, with the patient's clinical situation to establish a diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration (Tables 5, 6). Until recently, therapy of pulmonary aspiration was standardized, pragmatic, and frequently lacked an understanding of the distinct types of pulmonary aspiration. Controversy still surrounds some aspects of therapy. Perhaps, with additional efforts.},

  abstract = {Objective Foreign body ingestion (FBI) occurs infrequently but can be associated with rare risks including perforation. There is limited understanding of the impact of adult FBI in Australia. We aim to evaluate patient characteristics, outcomes and hospital costs of FBI. Design A retrospective cohort study of patients with FBI was performed at a non-prison referral centre in Melbourne, Australia. International Classification of Disease-10 coding identified patients with gastrointestinal FBI over financial years 2018--2021. Exclusion criteria were food bolus, medication foreign body, object in anus or rectum, or non-ingestion. Criteria for `emergent' classification were oesophagus, size {$>$}6 cm, disc batteries, airway compromise, peritonitis, sepsis and/or suspected viscus perforation. Results Thirty-two admissions attributed to 26 patients were included. The median age was 36 years (IQR: 27--56), 58\% were male and 35\% had a prior psychiatric or autism spectrum disorder. There were no deaths, perforations or surgery. Gastroscopy was performed in 16 admissions and 1 was scheduled following discharge. Rat-tooth forceps were used in 31\% and an overtube was used in 3 cases. The median time from presentation to gastroscopy was 673 minutes (IQR: 380--1013). Management was adherent to European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines in 81\%. After excluding admissions with FBI as a secondary diagnosis, median admission cost was \$A1989 (IQR: \$A643--\$A4976) and total admission costs over the 3 years was \$A84 448. Conclusion FBI in an Australian, non-prison referral centre is infrequent, can often be safely managed expectantly, and has limited impact on healthcare utilisation. Early, outpatient endoscopy could be considered for non-urgent cases, which may reduce costs while maintaining safety.},

Here, we present an atypical case of foreign body aspiration. CASE PRESENTATION: An 18-year-old female with major depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder presented for foreign body aspiration. She shared that she uses a box cutter to inflict self-harm and hides it in her mouth. Inadvertently, she aspirated the box cutter and presented to the hospital for the same reason. Besides a mild sore throat, she denied cough, hemoptysis or shortness of breath. She was hemodynamically stable on room air. Her aspiration event was confirmed on a chest x ray, with a blade visualized in the right lower lobe. Pulmonology was consulted emergently with plans for a bronchoscopy the following morning. A CT chest was ordered to confirm the location of the box cutter. Before this was performed, the patient spontaneously expelled the blade by coughing overnight before any intervention took place. The patient did not suffer any consequence. DISCUSSION: Physiologically, the larynx plays a protective role in preventing foreign objects from being aspirated via the closure of the epiglottis, vocal cords and cough reflex (1). In the absence of risk factors, aspiration of foreign objects as in our patient is unlikely. Additionally, aspirated sharp foreign objects are extremely hazardous and pose a risk of catastrophic complications to the airway including hemorrhage, post obstructive pneumonia, lung abscess and bronchiectasis. Emergent intervention using rigid bronchoscopy is warranted as the spontaneous and uneventful expulsion of sharp objects as in our patient, is rare in literature (2). CONCLUSIONS: Foreign body aspiration of sharp objects calls for immediate intervention due to the risk of lethal complications, given that the occurrence of spontaneous and atraumatic expulsion is extremely rare.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Foreign body ingestion (FBI) is a frequent concern in emergency departments. Clinical guidelines recommend performing plain x-rays as the primary  modality of diagnosis. Although point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) has increasingly  been integrated into the daily practice of emergency medicine, it has been poorly  investigated in the diagnostic approach for FBI.This review aims to highlight the  current state of PoCUS use for pediatric FBI.The following research question was  considered in this narrative review: Is PoCUS useful for FBI management? METHODS:  A literature search was conducted to identify articles reporting PoCUS use for  the management of FBI. All articles were assessed for quality by 2 reviewers.  MAIN RESULTS: The 14 selected articles reported 52 FBI cases in which PoCUS  successfully identified and located the ingested FB. Point-of-care ultrasound was  used either as the primary imaging technique or after positive or negative x-ray  findings. In 5 cases (9.6\%), PoCUS was the only modality used for the diagnosis.  Of these cases, 3 (60\%) underwent a successful procedure to remove the FB and 2  (40\%) received conservative treatment without complications. CONCLUSIONS: This  review suggests that PoCUS might be a reliable modality for the initial  management of FBI. PoCUS can locate, identify, and evaluate the size of the FB in  a wide range of materials and gastrointestinal locations. Point-of-care  ultrasound could eventually become the go-to modality in the case of radiolucent  FB, thus avoiding the use of radiation. Further studies are nevertheless required  to validate PoCUS use for FBI management.},

Across all countries, 60\% of transitions from ideation to plan and attempt occur within the first year after ideation onset. Consistent cross-national risk factors included being female, younger, less educated, unmarried and having a mental disorder. Interestingly, the strongest diagnostic risk factors were mood disorders in high-income countries but impulse control disorders in low- and middle-income countries.ConclusionThere is cross-national variability in the prevalence of suicidal behaviours, but strong consistency in the characteristics and risk factors for these behaviours. These findings have significant implications for the prediction and prevention of suicidal behaviours.},

  abstract = {Esophageal emergencies such as rupture or postoperative leak are uncommon but may be life threatening when they occur. Delay in their diagnosis and treatment may  significantly increase morbidity and mortality. Causes of esophageal injury  include iatrogenic (including esophagogastroduodenoscopy and stent placement),  foreign body ingestion, blunt or penetrating trauma to the chest or abdomen, and  forceful retching, also called Boerhaave syndrome. Although fluoroscopic  esophagography remains the imaging study of choice according the American College  of Radiology appropriateness criteria, CT esophagography has been shown to be at  least equal to if not superior to fluoroscopic evaluation for esophageal injury.  In addition, CT esophagography allows diagnosis of extraesophageal abnormalities,  both as the cause of the patient's symptoms as well as incidental findings. CT  esophagography also allows rapid diagnosis since the examination can be readily  performed in most clinical settings and requires no direct radiologist  supervision, requiring only properly trained technologists and a CT scanner.  Multiple prior studies have shown the limited utility of fluoroscopic  esophagography after a negative chest CT scan and the increase in accuracy after  adding oral contrast agent to CT examinations, although there is considerable  variability of CT esophagography protocols among institutions. Development of a  CT esophagography program, utilizing a well-defined protocol with input from  staff from the radiology, gastroenterology, emergency, and general surgery  departments, can facilitate more rapid diagnosis and patient care, especially in  overnight and emergency settings. The purpose of this article is to familiarize  radiologists with CT esophagography techniques and imaging findings of emergent  esophageal conditions.

Presentation of case A 29-year-old prisoner presented to the Emergency Department with vomiting, ten hours after he claimed to have swallowed a mobile phone. Clinical examination was unremarkable. Both initial and repeat abdominal radiographs eight hours later confirmed that the foreign body remained in situ in the stomach and had not progressed along the gastrointestinal tract. Based on these findings, upper endoscopy was performed under general anaesthesia. The object could not be aligned correctly to accommodate endoscopic removal using current retrieval devices. Following unsuccessful endoscopy, an upper midline laparotomy was performed and the phone was delivered through an anterior gastrotomy, away from the pylorus. The patient made an uneventful recovery and underwent psychological counselling prior to discharge. Discussion In this case report, the use of endoscopy in the management when a conservative approach fails is questioned. Can the current endoscopic retrieval devices be improved to limit the need for surgical interventions in future cases? Conclusion An ingested mobile phone in the stomach may not be amenable for removal using the current endoscopic retrieval devices. Improvements in overtubes or additional modifications of existing retrieval devices to ensure adequate alignment for removal without injuring the oesophagus are needed.},

  abstract = {Foreign body (FB) ingestion, which can be accidental or intentional, is quite common, especially in children, elderly and some categories of profession. On the other hand, perforation and abscess formation as complications of FB ingestion are rare. Their presentation is not clinically different from other causes of peritonitis and differential diagnosis is sometimes difficult. The most common cause of FB perforation is due to fish bone ingestion. We present two consecutive cases of complications associated to fish bone ingestion. In the first case, patient had diffused abdominal pain, without laboratory considerable signs of inflammation. Computer tomography (CT) scan evidenced ileal perforation due to a probable FB; in the second case patient presented abdominal pain, leukocytosis and elevated CRP. The CT scan revealed presence of abscess and omental inflammation near ileum. Both patients submitted surgery. In the first case, an enterotomy was done, in the second case omentectomy and abdominal cleaning were performed. Surprisingly, In the second case, the patient claimed for damages in the high suspicion for a medical error occurred in a previous operation. Fortunately, the specimen exam revealed the truth. Complications due to FBs ingestion must be adequately recognized and rapidly treated. Radiological tools, especially ultrasonography and CT scan, can be useful to make diagnosis but sometimes this is reached only at the time of intervention.},

Colonoscopic retrieval was unsuccessful. A subsequent laparotomy revealed a chronically inflamed thickened terminal ileum with mesenteric fat encroachment necessitating a right hemicolectomy. Histopathological analysis confirmed Crohn's disease with impaction of the 20-pence coin in a distal terminal ileum stricture near the ileo-caecal valve. LEARNING POINT: Gastrointestinal foreign body retention should alert the clinician to the presence of an undiagnosed bowel abnormality. Furthermore, failed endoscopic retrieval should be considered as a marker for potential underlying gastrointestinal pathology and a requirement for operative intervention. CONCLUSION: This case describes a rare presentation of Crohn's disease and highlights the need to consider underlying gastrointestinal pathology in patients presenting with a deteriorating clinical condition in the presence of an incidental foreign body.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six U.S. copper-based pre-1982 pennies, 12 zinc-based post-1982 pennies, a quarter, a nickel, and a dime were exposed to postprandial concentrations of gastric acid (0.15N HCl) for 7 days, and radiographs were obtained daily. Half the zinc-based coins were scraped to disrupt their copper coating. Coins were weighed at the start and completion of the study. RESULTS: Post-1982 zinc-based pennies developed radiolucent corrosive changes within 24 hours. Erosions on the coins became more apparent over time. Frank holes were present on day 2. The weights of these coins decreased 5\%-8\% during the study. Pre-1982 copper pennies and silver-colored coins showed no change on radiographs over 7 days. CONCLUSION: Unexpected radiolucent corrosions may develop in post-1982 zinc alloy pennies when retained in the stomach. Coins have long been considered innocuous foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tracts of children. However, because of the potential for ulceration and zinc-related morbidity, closer clinical and radiographic observation is warranted. Coins with scalloped edges or holes should be endoscopically removed, as they have likely been retained longer than 1 or 2 days.},

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a low density area with enhancement  in the mediastinum, especially around the esophageal wall. We planned to perform  surgical drainage with the intention of performing intraoperative endoscopy from  the beginning. We performed surgical drainage through a left cervical oblique  incision; however, there was no exudate obtained from the mediastinal space.  Despite the reported absence of accidental ingestion of a foreign substance,  intraoperative endoscopy was performed that revealed a laceration in the  esophageal mucosa 24~cm from the incisors. We diagnosed it as a submucosal  abscess of the esophagus and prescribed parenteral antibiotics. Submucosal  abscess of the esophagus can occur even in the absence of awareness of a foreign  body ingestion or oral infection. In case that the abscess was not localized  clearly within the outer membrane of the esophagus, the coincidental mediastinal  drainage via a cervical incision and intraoperative endoscopy seemed to be  useful.},

The possibility of penetration of the intestinal tract, by sharp, pointed objects, however, necessitates careful and continued observation. If such objects become lodged in a narrow segment of the gastrointestinal tract, perforation may occur. The resulting morbidity depends on the further route of the penetrating object and whether septic sequelae ensue. Although foreign bodies may migrate to almost any intraabdominal organ, perforation of the duodenum and migration into the liver are extremely rare. A case of a woman who unknowingly ingested a pin that perforated the duodenum causing only few acute symptoms is presented. Biliary tract pathology was suspected, but ultrasound examination ruled it out. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed a pin thrust into the liver, with the head of the pin in the wall of the duodenum. Traditional surgical treatment requires laparotomy for foreign body removal. In the reported case, the pin was removed laparoscopically. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient left the hospital on day 2 after the procedure. With laparoscopic approach for removal of penetrating intestinal foreign bodies, laparotomy and its attending complications are avoided. This approach is less invasive, has a beneficial impact on postoperative pain, produces a better cosmetic result, and offers a faster return to normal activities. Hospital stay and costs also are reduced.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Intentional ingestions of foreign objects (IIFO) continue to be prevalent among prisoners. Our previous research examined determinants of hospital admission, endoscopy, and surgery among prisoners who ingest foreign objects. However, little is known about the financial impact of these events on healthcare facilities that service the prisoner population. This study aims to fill this gap by examining hospital charges attributable to 435 prisoner episodes of IIFO. Methods: A retrospective review of all prisoners who presented to our medical center with the complaint of IIFO was conducted. Both Institutional Review Board and Bureau of Prisons approvals were obtained before data collection. All prisoners ages 18-75 were included between the dates of January 2004 and December 2011. Episodes were divided into three categories: (a) Unverified IIFO wherein ingested object was claimed by the patient but never identified; (b) verified IIFO wherein ingested object was clearly identified; (c) secondary events due to direct complications of previous IIFO episode (s). The temporal occurrence of IIFO was organized by increasing the number of episodes and grouped accordingly. Detailed list of hospital charges was obtained for every IIFO episode including: (a) emergency services, (b) procedures, (c) laboratory, (d) surgical supplies, (e) allied health services, (f) radiology studies, (g) anesthesiology charges, (h) pharmacy, and (h) intensive care costs. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze basic data. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine differences among nonnormally distributed variables and sub-groups. Statistical significance set at alpha = 0.05. Results: A total of 435 IIFO episodes occurred during the study period in a population of 125 patients (mean age 33.8 +/- 11.7 years, median age 34 [range 19-75] years, 92.8\% male). Hospital charges associated with these episodes totaled \$6,209,557. There were 94 unverified IIFOs, 332 verified IIFOs, and 9 secondary events. Verified IIFOs were associated with significantly greater median charges (\$5,860) than unverified IIFOs (\$3,997) and secondary events carried lower cost (\$3,501) than the former two (P {$<$} 0.01). We also observed a pattern of escalating costs associated with increasing number of sequential IIFO episodes, with the 1st episode carrying median charges of \$4,683 and episodes numbered 11+ carrying median charges of \$7,698 (P {$<$} 0.01). Conclusions: Hospital charges associated with the care of prisoners who ingest foreign objects tend to escalate over time. Although charges in most of the categories demonstrated increases with greater numbers of ingestions, the largest contributors to this pattern of escalating charges included radiology, pharmacy, hospital room charges, and surgical services. These findings suggest that early intervention in the destructive cycle of IIFO may not only improve patient outcomes but also result in savings to the healthcare system.

Oesophageal FBs were removed under direct vision (six cases), by rigid oesophagoscopy under general anaesthetic (77 cases), or using a balloon catheter under sedation (26 cases). All 224 FBs detected in the stomach or beyond were allowed to pass naturally, and delayed passage occurred in only one case. Passage of 11 alkaline disc batteries occurred without complication.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fish bone (FB) is one of the common causes of foreign body impaction in the pharynx and esophagus. PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of 64-slice  multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) for the evaluation of pharynx and upper  esophageal FB foreign bodies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-six patients with  suspected FB foreign body ingestion were examined by plain radiography (n\,=\,40)  and unenhanced MDCT (n\,=\,66). We analyzed the presence, location, size, shape,  and lying position of the foreign bodies. RESULTS: On MDCT, 46 foreign bodies  were detected. Among them, 45 were confirmed by endoscopy. The sensitivity of  MDCT for the detection of foreign bodies was 100\%, which was superior to that of  the plain radiography (51.7\%). The location of the foreign bodies was most common  in the upper esophagus (n\,=\,22, 47.8\%), followed by pharyngoesophageal junction  (n\,=\,10, 21.7\%), transjunctional (n\,=\,7, 15.2\%), hypopharynx (n\,=\,5, 10.9\%), and  oropharynx (n\,=\,2, 4.3\%). Their longest length was 5.3-40.1\,mm (mean, 21.3\,mm).  Thirty-three FBs (71.7\%) were linear and 13 (28.3\%) were flat in shape. They  showed transverse (n\,=\,23, 50.0\%), parallel (n\,=\,13, 28.3\%), and oblique  positions (n\,=\,10, 21.7\%) to the long axis of the pharynx and esophagus,  respectively. CONCLUSION: MDCT is useful for the evaluation of the pharynx and  upper esophageal FB foreign bodies.},

On an initial laparoscopic examination, foreign material was observed in the  peritoneal space with haemoperitoneum. Emergency exploration was then undertaken  for suspected gastric perforation. Full-thickness damage was identified on the  stomach wall during the operation. The material in the gastrointestinal tract and  peritoneal space was gently removed. Moulded casts of the entire stomach and  distal oesophagus were extracted successfully. The patient was discharged 14~days  after surgery. IMAGES: Computed tomography revealed foreign material occupying  the entire gastric chamber, as well as diffuse gastric perforation. CONCLUSIONS:  Life-threatening gastric perforation can occur after polyurethane foam ingestion.  Clinical/medical toxicologists and emergency physicians need to be aware of the  highly expandable nature of this agent.},

A cystoscopy was performed and the pencil was removed at the same time by using  grasping forceps and hydraulic overdistention of the urinary bladder.  CONCLUSIONS: Bladder is the most common location of foreign bodies of the  urogenital tract, almost always due to self-insertion into the urethra for the  purpose of masturbation or as a result of non-inhibited or altered behavior due  to psychiatric diseases, or to the influence of drugs. Most patients were too  ashamed to admit they had inserted or applied any object and usually presented  when a complication had occurred such as difficulty in voiding, hematuria, pain  or swelling, extravasations or abscess formation. The treatment can be  endoscopic, and it depends on the type of the foreign object and the operator's  skills.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Foreign body (FB) ingestion is a common clinical problem. Patients with increased risk include children and geriatric patients, intellectually or mentally disabled people, patients with psychiatric disorders or prisoners. About 80-90\% of ingested blunt foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract without symptoms, impaction or mucosal injury. However, 10\% to 20\% of the ingested FBs, especially sharp-pointed objects, batteries or magnets, require endoscopic removal, and 1\% or less of the patients require further surgical interventions in case of complications. Endoscopic removal provides high efficacy with considerable low interventional risks using protective devices such as endoscopic overtubes to remove sharp-pointed objects. Laparoscopic or open surgery is the last resort when other techniques have failed. Case report: A 18 year old female with borderline personality disorder (BPD) was admitted to the emergency department having swallowed three razor blades, three pinboard tacks and several pieces of broken glass. After the orotracheal intubation for airway protection interventional gastroscopy was performed at the intensive care unit. To protect the esophagus from injury by sharp-pointed objects we used a specialized overtube (Guardus{\textregistered} Overtube, US Endoscopy, 25 cm). Endoscopically, all foreign bodies were removed. A CT scan confirmed that the gastrointestinal tract was empty of other FBs. After 12 hours of monitoring, the patient was extubated and transferred to the psychiatry department. Discussion and Conclusion: Intentional ingestion of foreign objects is a topic that has generated mounting interest among medical professionals over the past two decades. Foreign body ingestion has been reported in patients with personality disorders as part of a spectrum of self-harming behavior. Most FB ingestions involve sharp objects. Management of FB ingestion in patients with BPD requires high levels of interdisciplinary collaboration between gastroenterologists, psychiatrists and surgeons. Endoscopic removal is the first choice in the management algorithm of this clinical emergency due to its efficacy, low morbidity, and low cost compared to surgical treatment. The timing of intervention is influenced by the patient's age and clinical condition, the size, sharpness and type of the ingested object as well as anatomic location of the lodged object. Orotracheal intubation of the patients before endoscopy is recommended as well as the use of a specialized removal device.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Strictures of the esophagus in children may have multiple etiologies including congenital, inflammatory, infectious, caustic ingestion, and  gastroesophageal reflux (peptic stricture [PS]). Current literature lacks good  data documenting long-term outcomes in children. This makes it difficult to  counsel some patients about realistic treatment expectations. The objective of  this study is to evaluate our institutional experience and define the natural  history and treatment outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective review of clinical data  obtained from children who underwent dilation for PS was performed. RESULTS: Over  the past 30 years, 114 children and adolescents received 486 dilations. The most  common indications for stricture dilation were PS (42\%) and esophageal atresia  (38\%). Other lesser indications included congenital, foreign body, corrosive,  cancer, radiation, allergic, and infectious. This review focuses on the 48  children with PS. Of the children with PS, a congenital anomaly was identified in  23 children; and 12 had neurologic impairment. Average age at presentation was  10.2 years (range, 0.5-18.3 years). Most patients had had symptoms for many  months before diagnosis. Peptic stricture was most common in the lower esophagus  (n = 39). However, middle (n = 8) and upper (n = 1) strictures were occasionally  identified. Noncompliance with medical therapy was a challenge in 12\% (n = 5) of  children. Children with a PS received a median of 3 dilations, but a subset of 5  patients with severe strictures underwent up to 48 dilations (range, 1-48).  Repeated dilations were required for a median of 20 months (range, 1-242 months).  Among patients receiving esophageal dilation for PS, 94\% required an antireflux  procedure (19\% required a second antireflux surgery). A subgroup of patients (n =  10) was identified who required extended dilations, multiple surgeries, and  esophageal resection. This subgroup had a significantly longer period of  symptomatic disease and increased risk of esophageal resection compared with  those patients requiring fewer dilations. Surgical resection of the esophageal  stricture was ultimately required in 3 children with PS after failure of more  conservative measures. CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents presenting with  reflux esophageal stricture (PS) frequently require antireflux surgery, redo  antireflux surgery, and multiple dilations for recurrent symptoms. We hope that  these data will be of use to the clinician attempting to counsel patients and  parents about treatment expectations in this challenging patient population.},

We had reviewed 1,428 patients with esophageal foreign body, who were hospitalized and treated over the past 25~years. A classification summary was made of 121 patients (of these 1,428 cases) who presented with esophageal foreign body-induced perforation and complicated cervical abscess, mediastinitis, and mediastinal abscess. This summary considered foreign body types, location and lodging duration, complications, and surgical approaches. Among these 121 patients, esophageal foreign bodies in 81 patients were successfully extracted via esophagoscope or fiber optic esophagoscope. Cervical esophageal foreign bodies in 22 patients were extracted by esophagoscope and lateral cervical incision (n~=~6) and simple lateral cervical incision (n~=~16). Thoracotomy was performed to remove thoracic esophageal foreign bodies in 18 patients with 10 successes and 8 failures. Of the 121 patients, 67 patients with cervical abscess were cured by means of lateral cervical abscess incision and drainage, esophageal stent placement, and esophageal perforation repair with pedicle myolemma or pedicle muscular periosteum flap. 54 patients with mediastinitis and/or abscess were all cured, except one mortality, by means of mediastinotomy and drainage or/and closed-chest drainage, simple esophageal repair, esophageal repair with pedicle myolemma or pedicle muscular periosteum flap and stent placement for esophageal perforation, and esophageal exclusion plus two-stage gastric-pharyngeal anastomosis. In the treatment of esophageal foreign body-induced severe complications, various therapies should be applied simultaneously. Lateral cervical incision should be made immediately to remove the foreign bodies if the foreign body extraction under esophagoscope proves to be a failure after repeated attempts, or esophageal perforation develops during the procedure, or should cervical abscess develop. Mediastinotomy and drainage or/and closed-chest drainage should be carried out as early as possible when mediastinitis and/or mediastinal abscess develops after esophageal foreign body ingestion.},

STUDY  DESIGN: Prospective study. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with oropharyngeal  dysphagia underwent videoendoscopy of swallowing to assess pharyngeal propulsion  as pathologic or nonpathologic, and aspiration. These features were compared with  those found on manometry and videofluoroscopy, which were considered as the  reference examinations. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative  predictive values of videoendoscopy were estimated, with their 95\% confidence  intervals. RESULTS: A total agreement between videoendoscopy and videofluoroscopy  was found in 76.4\% of cases for pharyngeal propulsion and in 82.3\% for  aspiration. This rate for pharyngeal propulsion reached 82.3\% between  videoendoscopy and manometry. Moreover, in 24 cases (70.5\%) in which  videofluoroscopy and manometry agreed for pharyngeal propulsion, 22 were assessed  similarly through fiberoscopy. When using fluoroscopy and manometry as reference  examinations, videoendoscopy detected nearly 90\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] =  0.80, 1.0) of impaired pharyngeal propulsion. Concerning aspiration, 70\% (95\% CI  = 0.54, 0.85) of events detected by videoendoscopy were also observed on  videofluoroscopy. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive  values of videoendoscopy reached a higher rate (90\% to 92.8\%) when agreement was  found between fluoroscopy and manometry. CONCLUSIONS: Videoendoscopy is an  examination that can be used to detect inexpensively pharyngeal propulsion  disorders and aspiration episodes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Injury remains a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in the developing world. The probability of injury occurrence is influenced by  agent, host and environmental factors. Studies of repeat injuries in childhood  therefore provide insight into factors in the epidemiological triad predisposing  children to injury. OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportion of children and the  factors associated with repeat presentations to the Red Cross War Memorial  Children's Hospital Trauma Unit (RCWMCH TU) in Cape Town, South Africa, for all  non-transport-related injuries in childhood. METHODS: This was a retrospective  cohort study using data from the RCWMCH TU. We included children aged 0 - 10  years with first presentation from January 1997 to June 2013 and followed up  until the earlier of age 13 years or June 2016. We assessed individual and  population-level factors associated with repeat injury using multilevel Poisson  regression analysis. Child dependency ratios were derived from the 2011 National  Census. RESULTS: Between 1997 and 2013, 72 490 children aged \&lt;10 years (59\%  male) presented to the RCWMCH TU for the first time with injuries. After the  initial injury, 9 417 (13\%) presented with a repeat injury by 2016 and before age  13 years. After adjusting for health subdistrict, distance from RCWMCH TU and age  at first presentation, factors associated with reduced repeat presentation were  injury identified as due to abuse (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 0.6; 95\%  confidence interval (CI) 0.4 - 0.7), fluid burn (aIRR 0.6; 95\% CI 0.6 - 0.7),  foreign body ingestion (aIRR 0.7; 95\% CI 0.7 - 0.9), and moderate and severe (v.  minor) initial injury (aIRR 0.9; 95\% CI 0.8 - 0.9 and aIRR 0.7; 95\% CI 0.6 - 0.8,  respectively), while boys were more likely to have repeat injury presentations  (aIRR 1.4; 95\% CI 1.4 - 1.5). CONCLUSIONS: Repeat presentations were substantial  and associated with male gender. They occurred less commonly after fluid burn  injuries, foreign body ingestion and moderate to severe injuries. Children with  intentional injuries were also less likely to have a repeat presentation. Further  research is indicated for childhood injuries with greater propensity to repeat,  including non-height falls and sport-related injuries. Secondary injury  prevention education should not neglect patients with unintentional and minor  injuries. These results strengthen the hypothesis that injuries arise as a result  of sustained exposure to agent, host and environmental risk factors.},

SETTING: University hospital, Spain. SUBJECTS: 21 patients who presented with intestinal perforation by foreign bodies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Size of perforations, nature of foreign bodies, clinical symptoms, radiological findings, treatment and outcome. RESULTS: The most common location was the terminal ileum (n = 11), followed by the rectosigmoid junction (n = 5). The objects were mainly bone fragments and toothpicks. The diagnosis was generally made at operation, and only 4 of the 21 patients had signs of pneumoperitoneum on the preoperative abdominal film. The most common treatment was simple suture of the defect. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal perforation by a foreign body is uncommon, and normally affects the ileocaecal and rectosigmoid regions, in which it is unusual to find pneumoperitoneum preoperatively. It must be considered in the differential diagnosis of such conditions as acute appendicitis and diverticulitis.},

Body packers either swallow drug-filled packets or introduce drug-filled packets into their bodies rectally or vaginally with the purpose of concealing them. The three main smuggled drugs are cocaine, heroin and cannabis products. Body packing represents a serious risk of acute narcotic toxicity from drug exposure, intestinal obstruction owing to pellet impaction and bowel perforation with consequent abdominal sepsis. A suspected body packer is generally admitted to hospital to perform imaging investigations and confirm the presence of drugs in his/her body. Radiological imaging methods are essential to diagnose body packing and to detect potential complications. Increasing sophistication of traffickers and improvements in packaging add to the detection difficulty. Radiologists should be aware of the appearance of drug packets in a range of imaging modalities. This article informs physicians about the challenging aspects of body packing, its background and medicolegal issues, what imaging methods can be used and what criteria are necessary to perform a correct diagnosis.},

Prior studies have examined  the effectiveness of this procedure, however no prior study has thoroughly  evaluated its complications. We anticipate that this analysis will provide  valuable insight into these procedures which can be used in patient education and  post-operative follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Manufacturer and User  Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for cases reporting  injury related to the pillar procedure. The case narratives were individually  analyzed and categorized by type of complication. A comparison of extruding parts  and select complications was also performed using chi-square analysis. RESULTS:  Of the 261 cases reported, 73.6\% reporting extruding parts, 47.5\% described  patient pain, and 38.7\% included patients describing a foreign body sensation.  Infection was reported in 7.7\% of the cases with cellulitis and abscess formation  specifically mentioned in one case. Cases describing pain and difficulty  swallowing were significantly more likely to have reported extruding parts  (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study describes various complications associated  with this procedure. The description of these complications and accompanying  literature review may provide healthcare professionals and patients with an  understanding of the scope of adverse events related to this procedure.},

  abstract = {Objective Deliberate foreign body ingestion (DFBI) is often impulsively driven, repetitive and refractory to intervention and frequently necessitates multiple medical interventions. As such, the frustrations among health care providers are great, and the financial toll on health care is significant. Nevertheless, the literature on DFBI is sparse, and suggestions for treatment planning and management are limited. The authors sought to investigate and uncover efficacious treatments and strategies for preventing reoccurrence in DFBI. We build on earlier work by offering both broad and diagnosis-specific management strategies. Method A literature review was performed addressing the presentation, management and prevention of reoccurrences of DFBI. Four cases of DFBI are presented illustrating those psychiatric diagnoses (psychosis, malingering, obsessive--compulsive disorder and borderline personality disorder) most frequently encountered in hospital practice. Both broad and specific treatment approaches are presented. Results Patients engaging in DFBI are best managed through a multidisciplinary approach, following acute medical management. Successful strategies for the prevention of reoccurrences of DFBI are inconclusive. Conclusion Understanding the function of this behavior is critical in developing treatment for patients who engage in these dangerous, potentially life-threatening, self-injurious behaviors. An amalgam of medical, pharmacological and cognitive--behavioral interventions is recommended, as is additional research.},

Patients who  notoriously swallow foreign objects generate significant economic costs to  hospitals. In previous publications, it has been argued that hospitals might  reduce the need for endoscopy by offering such patients a paid position to  discourage foreign body ingestions. However, the game-theoretical analysis  offered in the literature was based on a static game which did not justify the  relevant equilibrium. To obtain the actual goal of keeping the patient away from  foreign body ingestion, we consider a repeated game with an infinite horizon. We  show that there exists a combination of strategies applied by the hospital and  the patient that leads to a steady state in which the patient will be discouraged  from foreign body ingestion.},

METHODS: After internal review board approval, the charts of pediatric  patients (0-18years old) who had undergone slide tracheoplasty for  tracheoesophageal fistula were retrospectively reviewed. Patient information and  surgical outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: Nine patients underwent slide  tracheoplasty for correction of TE fistula. In five patients the original TE  fistula was congenital. Other causes included battery ingestion, tracheostomy  tube complications, foreign body erosion, and an iatrogenic injury. The average  age at repair was 48{\textpm}64 months (range: 1-190). Seven patients had undergone  previous TEF repair either open or endoscopically. There were no recurrences  after repair. Two patients had sternal periosteum interposed between the  esophagus and trachea. There were no TEF recurrences. A single patient had  dehiscence of the tracheal anastomosis and underwent a second procedure.  CONCLUSION: Slide tracheoplasty is an effective method to treat complex TE  fistulas. The procedure was not associated with any recurrences. This is the  first description of a novel, effective, and safe method to treat TE fistulas.},

It will suggest that once the possibilities of dissent through the voice (the political tool par excellence in a liberal democracy, and one associated primarily with rationality and the capacity for reason) are foreclosed, migrants tend to resort to another powerful tool: their own body. Detainees have made their bodies speak by resorting to practices of self-mutilation, hunger strike, suicide attempts, and lips and eyes sewing. Detainees' violent acts of dissent are not dissimilar from the violent modalities used, a few centuries earlier, by some enslaved people who chose liberty through death. The aim is not so much to make comparison between the two figures, but to emphasise the way in which, under conditions of extreme control, subjugation or unfreedom, acts of dissent and resistance -- and thus acts of politics, as articulated in Ranci{\`e}re's concept of dissensus -- are not necessarily enacted through democratic practices but, on the contrary, through whatever modalities are available to them, including violent (self-harm) modalities.},

When unwitnessed, it poses therapeutic and diagnostic challenges especially in the  presence of pre-existing anatomical pathology. We aim to analyze the clinical  course, management, and outcome of children with impacted esophageal FBs.  METHODS: Retrospective chart review (Jan 2000-Feb 2018) recruiting children with  impacted esophageal FBs. FBs in cricopharynx and those that moved to stomach were  excluded. Investigations/management were based on underlying anatomical  pathology, duration of impaction, and difficult FBs. Clinical details,  management, and outcomes were collated. RESULTS: Of 86 children, N1\,=\,31 had  identifiable predisposing anatomic pathology and N2\,=\,55 had impactions in normal  esophagus or difficult FBs. N1 group presented early (42~months), had recurrent  impactions (1-6), and needed multiple dilatations (0-8) and longer follow-up (avg  35~months). Food matter was commonest impaction. Many had persistent symptoms. N2  group had commonly coin impactions and strictures developed in long standing or  corrosive FBs. Most were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Abnormal esophageal anatomy  predisposes to impaction with organic food bolus. Age of presentation is earlier  with recurrent impactions requiring multiple dilatations/surgery and longer  follow-up. Metallic FBs commonly impact in normal esophagus and are often  innocuous. Atypical/multiple FBs may mirror an underlying psychiatric illness.},

A 58-year-old man with  a medical history of stage 5 chronic kidney disease was admitted to the intensive  care unit (ICU) for hyperkalemia and acute respiratory failure after a missed  dialysis session. He required vasopressors, intubation, and continuous renal  replacement therapy. Admission imaging demonstrated several ingested metallic  foreign bodies within the colon. There was consideration of colorectal surgery  and gastroenterology consultation. On the initial medication reconciliation, no  medications that would have the radiographic appearance of ingested metallic  foreign bodies were identified. On further review of prescription data available  through the electronic medical record, it was noted that the patient had recently  filled a prescription for lanthanum despite its apparent discontinuation on a  previous admission. After interviewing the patient's wife, it was confirmed that  the patient had continued taking lanthanum and that he was swallowing it whole  and not chewing it. No consultations or interventions were performed, and the  metallic foreign bodies were no longer present on further imaging after a period  of 35 days. CONCLUSION: Escalation of care was avoided in this patient due to the  performance of diligent medication reconciliation and recognition of the impact  of lanthanum ingestion on imaging.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The ingestion of foreign bodies is a frequently observed problem in daily clinical practice. In order to avoid complications such as perforation,  endoscopic removal of potentially penetrating foreign bodies should be attempted  quickly. The use of various endoscopic techniques has been reported for this  purpose. However, extraction of foreign bodies from the mid gastrointestinal  tract has rarely been reported. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a patient who  had swallowed a safety needle which could safely be removed from the jejunum by  means of double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE). The combination of a thin p-type  enteroscope with a thick t-type overtube was used in order to improve the  manoeuvrability of the endoscope. The needle was pulled into the overtube which  served as a protective shield during the retrieval of the endoscope. CONCLUSION:  Our case report describes the potential of removing foreign bodies from the deep  small bowel by pulling them into the overtube of a double-balloon enteroscope. If  the suspicion of foreign body impaction in the small bowel is made, it may be  advisable to primarily choose a balloon enteroscopy system. Through this, quick  and deep insertion can be combined with a safe removal of the foreign body.},

This potentially severe problem had a peak  incidence in children aged 6 months to 6 years. Intentional adult cases are  voluntary and more common in prisoners and people with psychiatric problems.  However, most patients (90\%) remain asymptomatic, and these pass through the body  spontaneously. CASE PRESENTATION: The authors report a case of surgically  removing plenteous sharp-pointed metallic foreign bodies ingested by a young male  deaf-mute bipolar schizoaffective patient from his stomach, intestine, and  rectum. Furthermore, the authors have reviewed the available literature for  similar cases. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Less than 1\% of patients need surgical  removal, 10-20\% need to be taken out endoscopically, and the remaining pass  spontaneously. Plain radiography is the most available imaging modality detecting  the number, material, and estimated place of the alimentary canal trapped.  CONCLUSION: For the risk of perforation, migration, and peritonitis, surgery is  indicated in such situations.},

Foreign body ingestions in prisoners are always intentional and  inmates can be manipulative, which makes medical decision even more difficult.  Our objective is to propose a decisional algorithm for management of foreign body  ingestion in prisoners. We reviewed the records of 198 admissions for foreign  body ingestion for a 10-year period. Type and number of ingested foreign bodies,  radiographic findings, outcome as well as the management method including  conservative, endoscopic removal, or surgical treatment were analyzed. Most cases  were managed conservatively (87.6\%). Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal  tract was performed in 37 cases with a success rate of 46 per cent. In 9.3 per  cent of cases, the final treatment was endoscopic. Only five patients required  surgical treatment, being emergent just in one case. We advocate conservative  treatment for asymptomatic patients with foreign body ingestion. Endoscopic  removal is proposed for pointed objects or objects bigger than 2.5 cm located in  the stomach. Objects longer than 6 to 8 cm located in the stomach should be  removed by endoscopy or laparoscopy. Patients with objects in the small bowel or  colon should be treated conservatively unless there are complications or they  fail to progress.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate findings at serial MRI after endoscopic removal of a button battery from the esophagus in a series of  pediatric patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Serial MRI examinations after removal  of a button battery from the esophagus were reviewed retrospectively for the  presence of mediastinal edema; imaging characteristics of the aorta and arteries;  imaging characteristics of the trachea; and imaging characteristics of the  esophageal wall at the level of injury. RESULTS. A total of 48 MRI examinations  were performed on 19 patients, 89\% (17/19) in the first 48 hours after battery  removal. Serial MRI was performed for 84\% (16/19) of patients. Initial MRI showed  extensive mediastinal edema in all 17 patients who underwent MRI in the first 48  hours. Edema directly abutted major arteries in all 17 patients and abutted the  airway in all 10 patients with proximal esophageal injury. Arterial vascular  changes were seen in 30\% (3/10) of patients with proximal esophageal injury and  57\% (4/7) of patients with mid or distalesophageal injury. Airway changes were  seen in 80\% (8/10) of patients with proximal esophageal injury. Serial MRI showed  improvement of airway changes in all patients and improvement in vessel wall  changes in all but one (25\%, 1/4) of the patients who had mid or distal  esophageal injury. Four patients (21\% [4/19]) had contained esophageal leak on  esophagrams. No patients in our series developed a tracheoesophageal or  vascular-enteric fistula. CONCLUSION. Our case series provides important  information on natural history of MRI findings in children after endoscopic  removal of a button battery from the esophagus. Further studies are needed to  determine the imaging findings most sensitive and specific for severe  complications, such as tracheoesophageal fistula and vascular-enteric fistula.},

However, to date there have been no critical evaluations of their  methodological rigor or quality. Herein, we address this need via the Appraisal  of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument. METHODS: A  literature search of Embase, MEDLINE via PubMed, and Scopus was performed up  until February 25, 2021. Identified CPGs were then assessed by four independent  reviewers trained in AGREE II. A scaled domain score of {$>$}60\% was indicated as  satisfactory quality. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated  to assess inter-reviewer agreement. RESULTS: 11 guidelines were assessed with  only one being classified as high quality and others being either average (two)  or low quality (eight). Domain 4 (clarity of presentation) achieved the highest  mean score (66.41~{\textpm}~13.33\%), while domain 5 (applicability) achieved the lowest  score (10.80~{\textpm}~10.37\%). ICC analysis revealed generally strong agreement between  reviewers with a range of 0.60-0.98. CONCLUSION: Quality appraisal using the  AGREE II instrument suggests that the methodologic rigor and quality of current  guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pediatric foreign body aspiration  and ingestion need significant improvement.},

This study aims to follow up patients presenting with foreign body (FB) ingestion requiring urgent endoscopic intervention under general anaesthetic in theatre, characterise each patient and establish whether admission or removal of the FB promotes further self-harm. METHOD: Eleven adult patients, totalling 38 presentations over a 28-month period were identified. Each was followed up from an initial presentation requiring endoscopy. RESULT: 9/11 (81.9\%) where transferred either from prison or psychiatric care with an extensive history of multimodal and usually violent self-harm. Of these 8/9 (88.9\%) had a formal psychiatric diagnosis linked to their previous self-harm. Objects retrieved included pens, razor blades, cutlery, wiring, batteries, a metal screw and a TV aerial. The median time between presentations with self-harm was 11 days. Those discharged from the emergency department re-presented after a median of 7.5 days. This was longer, at 14 days, if admitted to hospital; with those having endoscopic procedures re-presenting after a median of 11 days. CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient endoscopic removal of the FB was not associated with an earlier presentation with further self-harm when compared with discharge straight form A+E, but was frequently repeated, often in a characterised manner.},

Western countries are using increasingly restrictive policies, including the detention of asylum seekers, and there is concern that this is harmful.AimsTo investigate mental health outcomes among adult, child and adolescent immigration detainees.MethodA systematic review was conducted of studies investigating the impact of immigration detention on the mental health of children, adolescents and adults, identified by a systematic search of databases and a supplementary manual search of references.ResultsTen studies were identified. All reported high levels of mental health problems in detainees. Anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder were commonly reported, as were self-harm and suicidal ideation. Time in detention was positively associated with severity of distress. There is evidence for an initial improvement in mental health occurring subsequent to release, although longitudinal results have shown that the negative impact of detention persists.ConclusionsThis area of research is in its infancy and studies are limited by methodological constraints. Findings consistently report high levels of mental health problems among detainees. There is some evidence to suggest an independent adverse effect of detention on mental health.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The discovery of foreign bodies (FB) in the rectum is an infrequent clinical problem. Most commonly, FB are introduced through the anal passage or  reach the rectum after oral ingestion. We describe our experience in the  diagnosis and treatment of FB retained in the rectum. METHOD: From 1997 to 2004,  data were collected prospectively in 30 patients (20 men and 10 women; median age  42.5 years). Extraction method, size and type of object, and postextraction  evolution were reviewed. RESULTS: The FB was introduced anally in 16 cases and by  oral ingestion in 14. Principal associated factors were: mental disorder in 11,  penitentiary confinement in two, and drug and alcohol intake in two. Recent  sexual activity had taken place in 14 cases. The size and nature of the FB were  varied. The most frequent symptom was constipation with or without pelvic or anal  discomfort (n = 23, 77\%). Treatment consisted of spontaneous ejection (n = 2),  digital extraction with or without enemas (n = 10), digital extraction under  local/regional anaesthesia after fragmentation (n = 11) and regional exploratory  laparotomy under general anaesthesia (n = 7). Grade I rectal trauma was the most  common (n = 23, 77\%). Six patients required colostomy. Four patients (13.5\%)  suffered complications and none died. Only 17 patients were hospitalized, with a  mean stay of 6 days. All patients recovered without sequelae. CONCLUSION: The  diagnosis of rectal FB should be suspected when faced with low pelvic or perianal  abdominal pain and/or rectal haemorrhage within the context of an unconvincing  story in patients without a history of recent instrumental rectal exploration for  therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. Because of potential complications, FB in the  rectum should be considered a serious condition that must be treated without  delay.},

METHOD: From 1995 to 2006, data were collected prospectively in 33 patients (18 women and 15 men; mean age 64 years) operated on for intestinal perforation due to an ingested FB. The type of object, preoperative diagnosis, perforation site, treatment, morbidity and mortality were reviewed. RESULTS: Foreign body ingestion was predominantly involuntary (88\%). The mean time from ingestion to perforation was 10.4 days. The most frequently ingested objects were dietary FB (n = 21) and toothpicks (n = 6). The most frequent predisposing factors were dentures or an orthodontic appliance (73\%). The most common preoperative diagnoses were acute abdomen of uncertain origin (n = 7), acute appendicitis (n = 7) and acute diverticulitis (n = 5). Pneumoperitoneum was observed in 10 cases. The diagnosis was reached during laparotomy in 30 (91\%) cases. The most frequent perforation site was the colorectal region (n = 18, 54.5\%), followed by the terminal ileum (n = 7, 21.2\%); intraperitoneal perforation was the most common (n = 30, 91\%). All cases had abdominal contamination and 22 (66.7\%) had diffuse peritonitis. Treatment was always by surgery and antibiotics. Thirteen patients required a colostomy. Morbidity was 57.6\% (n = 19) and mortality 6.1\% (n = 2). CONCLUSION: Intestinal perforation by a foreign body is rare and normally affects the sigmoid colon, rectum or distal ileum. Dentures are a common risk factor. Patients are rarely aware of foreign body ingestion. Dietary FB and toothpicks are the most commonly ingested objects. Treatment consists of surgery and antibiotics. Appendicitis and acute diverticulitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis.},

METHODS: We analyzed data from all patients treated for DB  ingestion at our hospital from June 2010 to January 2024. A protocol established  in 2010 requires angio-CT scans for esophageal DB cases and a multidisciplinary  approach involving gastroenterologists, otolaryngologists, pediatric and airway  surgeons, and cardiac surgeons. RESULTS: We treated 22 patients. In June 2010,  following the tragic death of a patient from an undiagnosed DB ingestion that led  to an aortoesophageal fistula, our protocol was established. All DBs were removed  endoscopically. Four patients needed additional surgery: two had tracheal  resection/anastomosis and esophageal repair for large tracheoesophageal fistulas;  one required aortic wall reinforcement with a patch; one underwent endoscopic  removal with a sternal split to explore the aortic arch. All 22 patients survived  and recovered clinically. One developed bilateral vocal cord palsy as a  complication. CONCLUSION: Effective management of DB ingestion complications  necessitates a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach. Our protocol has  improved management strategies and patient outcomes.},

METHODS: Children {$<$}18years old who  ingested a battery between 1/2011 and 9/2016 at two tertiary care children's  hospitals were reviewed. Demographics, imaging, management and outcomes were  analyzed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square and Wilcoxon Rank-sum tests.  RESULTS: There were 180 battery ingestions. The median age was 3.9 (range 0.7-18)  years, with 78 (43\%) males. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain (17\%)  and nausea/vomiting (14\%). Diagnosis was confirmed with plain radiographs in 170  (94\%) patients. Locations on imaging were: stomach (37\%), small bowel (24\%),  esophagus (18\%), colon (11\%), and non-specific location past the gastroesophageal  junction (9\%). Treatment was dictated by five different subspecialties including  surgery (35\%), gastroenterology (25\%), emergency medicine (19\%), primary  care/emergency with a consulting service (13\%), and otolaryngology (8\%). All  esophageal batteries (n=33) had an intervention. Interventions included  fluoroscopic balloon extraction (6 attempted, 33\% retrieval rate), rigid  esophagoscopy (26 attempted, 96\% retrieval rate), and EGD (6 attempted, 83\%  retrieval rate). For batteries distal to the gastroesophageal junction 16 (11\%)  patients had an intervention. Interventions included EGD (13 patients, 69\%  retrieval), colonoscopy (1 patient, successful retrieval), and abdominal surgery  in two patients. CONCLUSION: Isolated batteries that pass the gastroesophageal  junction rarely require intervention and can be managed conservatively. Given the  variability in managing these patients, we developed an evidence based algorithm.  LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 2. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective Study.},

We changed our  management algorithm for suspected button battery ingestions with intent to  reduce time to evaluation and operative removal. METHODS: A retrospective study  was performed to identify and evaluate time to treatment and outcome for all  esophageal button battery ingestions presenting to a major children's hospital  emergency room from February 1, 2010 through February 1, 2012. During the first  year, standard emergency room triage (ST) was used. During the second year, the  triage protocol was changed and Trauma I triage (TT) was used. RESULTS: 24  children had suspected button battery ingestions with 11 having esophageal  impaction. One esophageal impaction was due to 2 stacked coins. Time from arrival  in emergency room to battery removal was 183minutes in ST group (n=4) and  33minutes in TT group (n=7) (p=0.04). One patient in ST developed a  tracheoesophageal fistula. There were no complications in the TT group.  CONCLUSIONS: The use of Trauma 1 activations for suspected button battery  ingestions has led to more expedient evaluation and shortened time to removal of  impacted esophageal batteries.},

Both rigid (RE) and flexible (FE) endoscopic techniques are used for  removal of esophageal FBs; however, there is no consensus amongst pediatric  surgeons regarding the best method. This study reviewed our experience managing  esophageal FBs using both techniques. METHODS: A 12-year retrospective review of  children admitted with an esophageal FB between 1999 and 2012 was undertaken.  Clinical data, management techniques, and complications were abstracted.  Differences between these two groups were compared with standard statistical  methods. RESULTS: 657 children were treated for esophageal FB ingestion, of which  366 (56\%) were treated with FE. The most frequently ingested item was a coin  (84\%), and FBs were most commonly lodged in the upper third of the esophagus  (78\%). There was a slightly younger population in the FE group (4.0 vs. 3.3  years, p {$<$} 0.01), but otherwise no significant differences were found between the  groups. The FB was successfully removed with the initially chosen technique in  97\% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal FBs may be successfully removed with  either RE or FE. Since treatment failures were managed with conversion to the  other technique, both procedures should be included in the training curriculum.},

  abstract = {Choking (or foreign body airway obstruction) is a widespread phenomenon with serious consequences of morbidity and mortality. Choking (often also called  suffocation) can be caused by food or inedible objects and leads to various  degrees of asphyxiation or lack of oxygen in the blood stream. The incidence is  very high in both young children and adults, especially seniors. However, since  not all choking episodes end up in the emergency room or become fatalities, they  often escape statistics. Although episodes of choking from non-edible bodies are  infrequent, they affect mostly young children. Three of the most common risks for  choking in general are neurological disorders, dysphagia and dental issues (few  or no teeth, unstable or unsuitable prosthesis or orthodontic appliances).~ The  purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk factors of choking and ways to  reduce/avoid this event. We reported data on a series of 138 patients admitted to  the emergency department following a choking event, at a hospital in Rome, Italy.  The age group of the analyzed population ranged from 1 to 88 years, with the most  represented age group of these between 40 and 59, with a similar distribution  between males and females. The types of foods on which people choked reflected  the seasonal, traditional and local foods: 67\% of patients reported choking on  fish bones followed by meat bones (9\%)~ and artichokes (3\%). Three relevant  non-food choking elements reported were: orthodontic items, toothpicks and pins  (one occurrence each). We also reported on two clinical cases of patients choking  on meat and a chicken bone. In conclusion, choking awareness and prevention are  essential for implementing potential life-saving precautions. Prevention is the  first tool to reduce the occurrence of this event, therefore it is necessary to  analyze the risk factors and educate the population to eliminate them. Proper  chewing and oral manipulation are paramount functions in preventing choking,  along with meal-time supervision if little children and elderly. Then, it  behooves the healthcare professionals to disseminate knowledge.},

  abstract = {Background Timely intervention is essential for the successful removal of ingested foreign bodies. Emergent endoscopy (EGD) is usually performed in the emergency department (ED), operating room (OR), intensive care unit (ICU), or endoscopy suite. However, because the endoscopy suite is not always available, this study investigated the impact of location outside of the endoscopy suite on the successful removal of ingested foreign bodies and other patient outcomes. Methodology We reviewed charts of patients who underwent EGD for foreign body removal at an academic quaternary center between January 01, 2012, and December 31, 2020. We defined successful EGD as retrieval of the foreign body at the first attempt and not requiring subsequent endoscopy or surgical intervention. We performed descriptive and inferential statistical analyses and conducted classification and regression trees to compare endoscopy procedure length (EPL) and hospital length of stay (HLOS) between different locations. Results We analyzed 77 patients, of whom 13 (17\%) underwent endoscopy in the ICU, 46 (60\%) in the OR, and 18 (23\%) in the ED. Endoscopic removal failed in four (5\%) patients. Endoscopy length was significantly shorter in the OR (67 (48-122) minutes) versus the ICU (158 (95-166) minutes, P = 0.004) and the ED (111 (92-155) minutes, P = 0.009). Time to procedure was similar if the procedure was performed in the ED (278 minutes), the ICU (331 minutes), or the OR (378 minutes). The median (interquartile range) of HLOS for the OR group (0.87 (0.54-2.03) days) was significantly shorter than the ICU group (2.26 (1.47-6.91) days, P = 0.007). Conclusions While performing endoscopy for esophageal foreign body removal in the OR may be associated with a shorter EPL and HLOS, no location was inferior for overall outcomes. Further prospective and randomized studies are needed to confirm our findings.},

Initial and follow-up management strategies depend on multiple patient and  ingested object-related factors. Available literature on this topic tends to  focus on the small child or adult, leaving the clinician caring for adolescents  to extrapolate this information to guide decision making for individual patients.  This article reviews foreign body ingestion literature with important  implications to the adolescent patient and raises awareness of some highly  dangerous objects such as large button batteries, high-powered magnets, long  sharps, narcotic packages, and super absorbent objects. An additional focus  includes the management of esophageal food impaction. We highlight the unique  aspects to the care of the adolescent with intentional ingestion and co-morbid  psychiatric illness. The article concludes by discussing the challenges to  prevention of ingestion in the at-risk patient.},

  abstract = {Surgical procedures have been employed for the relief of several pathologic conditions in the esophagus, the most common being the impaction of foreign bodies, cardiospasm, benign cicatricial stricture, carcinoma and diverticula. Impacted foreign bodies are now much less commonly dealt with by surgical means because of the easier and less dangerous method, in the hands of experts, of extraction through the esophagoscope, while surgical procedures have been almost eliminated from the treatment for cardiospasm. In this article the last three conditions, essentially, are considered.Until within the past fifty years the esophagus received scant attention from the surgeon in spite of the well recognized pathologic conditions for which, theoretically, surgical procedures might well have been indicated. This is all the more striking when one remembers that the ancient Hindoos operated on the bladder for stone, and that Herophilus of the Alexandrian School used the knife boldly on such internal organs},

Presenting  symptoms, clinical examination, and laboratory findings can guide selection of  diagnostic imaging. RECENT FINDINGS: Intussusception and intestinal malrotation  are potentially serious causes of intestinal obstruction, which are best  evaluated by ultrasound and upper gastrointestinal series, respectively.  Ultrasound has diagnostic importance in the evaluation of multiple diseases,  including appendicitis, by potentially decreasing the need for inpatient  observation, cholecystitis and complications of gall stones such as pancreatitis,  and ovarian diseases. Pelvic inflammatory disease should be considered in  evaluation of a teenage girl with lower abdominal pain. Less common causes of  acute abdominal pain include ingested foreign bodies, infected congenital  anomalies, and perforated peptic ulcer disease. SUMMARY: Presenting symptoms and  physical examination findings can narrow the number of potential diagnoses in  pediatric acute abdominal pain and thereby guide diagnostic imaging selection.  Abdominal/pelvic ultrasound, rather than computed tomography scan, is the  preferred modality for initial evaluation of many potential causes of pediatric  abdominal pain.},

However, this subject is poorly  investigated in epidemiological studies. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was  to assess the association between TMD and SCO. MATERIAL AND METHODS:  Seventy-eight individuals with TMD and 93 control individuals without TMD were  enrolled in a case-control study and paired according to age and gender.  Panoramic radiographs were made of all participants, and SCO was measured in  millimeters (mm) by a blinded researcher. Ossification was held to begin at  measurements of 30 mm or more. The association between symptoms (pain upon  swallowing or turning the head and the sensation of a foreign body in the throat)  and SCO was investigated. Pearson chi-square tests were used for the comparison  of proportions, ({$\alpha$}=.05). RESULTS: A total of 44.9\% of those with TMD and 46.2\% of  the control population exhibited SCO (P=.858). TMD was associated with pain upon  swallowing (P{$<$}.05) and upon turning the head P{$<$}.01), but there were no  associations between the symptoms possibly related to SCO and the presence of  ossification (pain upon swallowing P=.658; sensation of a foreign body in the  throat P=.980; pain upon turning the head P=.405). CONCLUSIONS: The results  suggest that there are no associations between TMD and SCO. Some symptoms  classically associated with SCO also occur in TMD patients.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Asphyxiation or suffocation injuries can result in multi-organ damage and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among different age  groups. This study aims to describe characteristics of patients presenting with  suffocation injuries to emergency departments (EDs) in the United States (U.S.)  and to identify factors associated with mortality in this population. METHODS: We  conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study using the 2013 U.S National  Emergency Department Sample database. ED visits with primary diagnoses of  intentional or accidental suffocation injury, and injury by inhalation and  aspiration of foreign bodies or food (ICD-9-CM codes) were included. We performed  descriptive statistics to describe the study population. This was followed by  multivariate analyses to identify factors associated with mortality. RESULTS: We  included a total of 27,381 ED visits for suffocation injuries. Most suffered from  either inhalation and ingestion of food causing obstruction of respiratory tract  or suffocation (51.6\%), or suicide and self-inflicted injury by hanging,  strangulation, and suffocation (39.4\%). Overall mortality was 10.9\%. Over half  (54.7\%) of the patients were between 19 and 65 years old. Males were more common  than females (59.1\% vs. 40.9\%). Over half of the patients (54.9\%) were treated  and released from the ED. Factors associated with increased mortality included  male gender, young age (4-18 years), diseases of the cardiac, respiratory,  genitourinary and neurologic systems, intentional self-harm, and self-payer  status. CONCLUSION: Mortality from suffocation injuries remains high with  significant burden on children and adolescents and on patients with intentional  injuries. Tailored initiatives targeting identified modifiable factors through  implementation of behavioral and environmental change can reduce the risk of  suffocation injury and improve clinical outcomes of affected victims.},

Imaging can facilitate the selection of  appropriate treatment options and assist in differential diagnosis. Esophageal  obstruction in cattle is generally caused by greedy nature of chewing and  swallowing of food and foreign structures, including stones, potatoes,  trichobezoar, carrots, foodstuffs (i.e., hay), and rice chaff. Esophageal  obstruction in cattle can also be caused by artificial procedures, and early  detection and treatment are important to avoid severe esophageal injury and its  associated risks. Herein, an 11-month-old Japanese black heifer presented with  swelling and induration of the neck and snowball crepitation in the subcutaneous  area of the left shoulder. Radiography and endoscopy revealed a spring-like  foreign body in the esophagus and a cervical esophageal obstruction. Esophageal  surgery confirmed that the foreign body was a ruminal mechanical stimulating  brush (RB). The case died on day 8 after the initial examination. Pathological  necropsy revealed that the RB had entered the esophageal diverticulum and caused  esophageal obstruction. This case provides a valuable reminder about the risk of  esophageal disease with oral administration procedures.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the management and outcomes of primary button battery ingestions and their sequelae at a single high-volume  center, and to propose a risk score to predict the likelihood of a severe  outcome. METHODS: The medical record was queried for all patients under 21 years  old evaluated at our institution for button battery ingestion from 2008 to 2021.  A severe outcome was defined as having at least one of the following:  deep/circumferential mucosal erosion, perforation, mediastinitis, vascular or  airway injury/fistula, or development of esophageal stricture. From a selection  of clinically relevant factors, logistic regression determined predictors of a  severe outcome, which were incorporated into a risk model. RESULTS: 143 patients  evaluated for button battery ingestion were analyzed. 24 (17\%) had a severe  outcome. The independent predictors of a severe outcome in multivariate analysis  were location of battery in the esophagus on imaging (96\%), battery size  {$>$}/~=~2~cm (95\%), and presence of any symptoms on presentation (96\%), with  P~{$<~$}0.001 in all cases. Predicted probability of a severe outcome ranged from 88\%  when all three risk factors were observed, to 0.3\% when none were present.  CONCLUSION: We report the presentation, management, and complication profiles of  a large cohort of BB ingestions treated at a single institution. A risk score to  predict severe outcomes may be used by providers initially evaluating patients  with button battery ingestion in order to allocate resources and expedite  transfer to a center with pediatric endoscopic and surgical capabilities.

In conclusion, the presence of a clear effluent or the  administration of 10 L of PEG-ELS are not valid markers for the termination of  WBI if complete elimination of a foreign body is required. Pretreatment with 10  mg of oral metoclopramide does not enhance the efficiency of WBI.},

There are 157 published accounts of wounding of the heart and/or great vessels by pins and needles. The victims have ranged from infants to the elderly. Causative agencies were accidents, suicide, and homicide. A few were discovered at necropsy in presumably asymptomatic persons. Six of the accidental injuries were iatrogenic. The objects reached the heart or great vessels from transthoracic insertion, ingestion, embolization, aspiration, or transabdominal penetration. The overall mortality incidence was about 50\%. Acute cardiac tamponade was the dominant cause of death. Almost all individuals survived who were operated upon and from whom the object was removed. The right ventricle was hurt most often, but no region of the heart or of the great vessels was spared. Occasionally multiple parts were affected. The primary damage occurred principally while the foreign body was extracardiac and relatively immobilized, from repetitive scratching or puncturing of the beating heart. Chest pain and unfolding patterns of tamponade were inconsistent in onset, severity, and duration. Death ensuing days or weeks after the initial injury was frequent. Progressive haemopericardium in some cases was due to or aggravated by laceration of a structure from within outward. Late complications---several fatal---were consequent upon inflammation, sepsis or thromboembolism. It is urged that all foreign bodies in the heart or great vessels be retrieved, even if seemingly innocuous clinically.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Emergency departments are facing nowadays an increasing number of illegal drug-related health problems, associated with medicolegal and/or social  consequences. Body stuffers are street cocaine dealers, who either store wrapped  packets of drugs in their rectum or hastily swallow them, prompted by fear of  police's arrest. These packets can be life threatening in case of leakage. We  evaluate the diagnostic value of unenhanced multidetector CT (MDCT) for detection  of cocaine-filled packets (CFP) ingested by body stuffers in a phantom model.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our phantom simulated normal bowel contents in which a  varying number of true and false CFP were randomly mixed. Both only differ in  radiological density. During 18 different reading sessions, four radiologists  independently evaluated the presence and number of true and false CFP.  Interobserver agreement, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative  predictive value were calculated. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement for detection  of any packets, for visualization of true, and false CFP was good (kappa=0.63,  0.74 and 0.58, respectively). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative  predictive value for detection of any packets was 95.6\%, 100\%, 100\% and 62.5\%,  respectively; for visualization of the true CFP 86.5\%, 100\%, 100\% and 77.6\%,  respectively; and for the false packets 98.1\%, 65\%, 88.6\% and 87.5\%,  respectively. CONCLUSION: Unenhanced MDCT without bowel preparation is a fast,  reliable and easily reproducible imaging modality for the immediate detection of  ingested CFP, thus facilitating medicolegal management of body stuffers.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Foreign bodies in the oesophagus represent a frequent emergency situation in ENT medicine. Usually the cases involve lumps of meat, bones, shards  of glass, bottle tops, batteries or dentures. We would like to report about an  unusual foreign body found in the oesophagus. PATIENT: A 45-year-old patient  presented himself in our interdisciplinary casualty department where he claimed  to have swallowed a butter-knife that morning as a bet. The ENT examination  showed no abnormal findings. The thorax X-Ray revealed a 14 cm-long foreign body  in projection to the oesophagus, which matched the knife. Following consultation  with the thorax surgeon, a rigid oesophagoscopy was conducted under endotracheal  intubation and the knife was easily removed using tongs. Archive searches  conducted in the meantime showed that foreign bodies had been removed from the  patient on numerous occasions by fellow surgeons either laparoscopically or via  open surgery. As a result, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric ward  with unimpeded swallowing reflex with a suspected self-harming syndrome.  DISCUSSION: As an ENT emergency, a foreign body in the oesophagus generally  requires intervention because of the risk of complications such as perforation or  pressure-induced necrosis of the oesophagus wall with resulting mediastinitis.  Suitable instruments are the flexible oesophagoscope, the rigid oesophagoscope  under anaesthesia or transcervical/transthoracic removal. The choice of procedure  crucially depends on the type and localisation of the foreign body in the  oesophagus. Particularly in cases of unusual foreign objects or repeated foreign  object ingestion, it should be considered whether a psychological illness could  be the cause and whether the introduction of appropriate therapy could be  expedient.},

The purpose of this study was to present cases of  patients with esophageal button battery ingestion treated at our clinic and to  emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Records of  patients admitted to our hospital for foreign body ingestion between January 2010  and May 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Cases with button battery lodged in  the esophagus were included in the study. Patient data regarding age, sex, length  of time after ingestion until admission, presenting clinical symptoms, type and  localization of the battery, management, and prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS:  Among 1891 foreign body ingestions, 71 were localized in the esophagus, and 8 of  those (11.2\%) were cases of button battery ingestion. Mean age was 1.7 years.  Admission was within 6 hours of ingestion in 5 cases, after 24 hours had elapsed  in 2, and 1 month after ingestion in 1 case. All patients but 1 knew the history  of ingestion. Prompt endoscopic removal was performed for all patients. Three  patients developed esophageal stricture, which responded to dilatation.  CONCLUSION: Early recognition and timely endoscopic removal is mandatory in  esophageal button battery ingestion. It should be suspected in the differential  diagnosis of patients with persistent respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although foreign body ingestion is relatively common, toothbrush swallowing is rare. A diagnosis of small-bowel perforation, caused by a sharp or pointed foreign body, is rarely made preoperatively because the clinical symptoms are usually nonspecific and can mimic other surgical conditions, such as appendicitis and diverticulitis. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of a swallowed toothbrush which passed past the pylorus and perforated the terminal ileum. The patient however presented with a fluctuant mass in the left iliac fossa, pyrexia and generalised tenderness mimicking a diverticular abscess. DISCUSSION: Ingestion of a foreign body is commonly encountered in the clinic among children, adults with intellectual impairment, psychiatric illness or alcoholism, and dental prosthetic-wearing elderly subjects. However, toothbrush swallowing is rare, with only approximately 40 reported cases. CONCLUSION: Bowel perforation by foreign bodies can mimic acute appendicitis and should be considered in differential diagnoses. Clinically, patients often do not recall ingesting the foreign body, which makes the clinical diagnosis more challenging, and a correct diagnosis is frequently delayed. Several radiological investigations, such as small-bowel series, ultrasonography, and computed tomography scans, may lead to the correct diagnosis, but in most patients, the diagnosis is not confirmed until the surgical intervention has been performed.},

  abstract = {Introduction: In factitious disorder (Munchausen syndrome), patients induce or aggravate symptoms of physical or psychological illness to receive attention and medical treatment. The motivation of these patients is merely getting a sick role and medical care, and entering the medical system; most of these patients have simultaneous mood disorders (especially depression), or personality disorders. Patients with factitious disorder have no secondary gain. Case Presentation: Herein, we present a middle-aged Azerbaijani man from Sarab city, East Azerbaijan who referred to hospital with complaints of abdominal and leg pain. Based on examinations, he had undergone repeated surgical procedures (laparotomy and surgical removal of the external object from the leg) due to the presence of a foreign body (needle and nail) in the intestines and leg's calf. The interview was done based on DSM-5 by a psychiatrist and after a two-month follow-up, the diagnosis was affirmed by a second opinion through a ground round session at the department of psychiatry, Tabriz university of medical sciences, Tabriz, Iran. He is under treatment with an SSRI along with cognitive psychotherapy. Conclusions: Patients with atypical and unusual manifestations of an illness associated with frequent hospital admissions and receiving multiple therapies can lead us to the diagnosis of a factitious disorder. Although patients often deny their disease and evade treatment, he was ultimately diagnosed with factitious disorder and received psychiatric treatment. The treatment goal is to reduce mortality and morbidity and to treat the underlying psychiatric disorder.},

Several techniques are available for retrieving fish hooks, ranging from simple non-invasive techniques to more complicated and invasive surgical procedures. The purpose of this case report is to document the successful surgical retrieval of an oesophageal foreign body (fish hook) using a minimally invasive oesophagotomy technique (MIOT) in an Indian Flap-shell turtle (Lissemys punctata). The adult male Indian Flap-shell turtle (Lissemys punctata) presented with a nylon thread protruding from its mouth. The dorsoventral radiographs confirmed the presence of a foreign body in the caudal oesophagus, just outside the coelomic cavity. After the induction of general anaesthesia, a sterile artificial insemination (AI) sheath was passed intraorally through the fishing line until it reached the hook. The fish hook was then retrieved by making a 5 mm incision at the point where the tip of the AI sheath was felt. The incision in the oesophagus and skin was closed in a routine manner. The turtle was kept in secure captivity for 20 days, following which it was released to its natural habitat. The oesophagotomy technique used in this case reduces the size of the incision considerably, thereby decreasing the possibility of postoperative complications.},

The purpose of our study was to determine the optimal protocol  for radiographic survey post-coin ingestion. We hypothesized that for children  presenting with a clear history of coin ingestion a frontal chest radiograph  including the entire esophagus is adequate to guide treatment. METHODS: We  reviewed the clinical history and radiographic surveys of 134 patients presenting  with suspected or witnessed coin ingestion to the emergency department of a  tertiary care pediatric hospital between January 2012 and June 2016. Patient  demographics, presenting symptoms, anatomic coverage of survey, type, number and  location of radiopaque foreign bodies, intervention, and follow-up were recorded.  RESULTS: Coins were identified on radiographic surveys in 109 of 134 patients; 25  of 134 patients had no coin. Of those with coins, none of 109 had coin(s) in the  airway, 42 of 109 had coin(s) in the esophagus, and 67 of 109 had coin(s) distal  to the esophagus. Of those with esophageal coins, 35 of 42 reported symptoms, 7  of 42 were asymptomatic, 40 of 42 underwent endoscopic coin removal, and 2 of 42  had no intervention. Of 92 of 134 surveyed patients with no coin or coin distal  to the esophagus, 30 of 92 reported symptoms, 62 of 92 were asymptomatic, 90 of  92 had no further intervention, and 2 of 92 eventually underwent endoscopic coin  removal for specific indications (abdominal pain, delayed passage). When there  was no coin found in the esophagus, the negative predictive value for  intervention was 97.8\%. CONCLUSIONS: Following a clear history of coin ingestion,  a frontal chest radiograph including the entire length of the esophagus provides  sufficient information to direct patient management.},

  abstract = {Self-harm rates amongst the UK female prison population are disproportionately high. Prison staff potentially have a crucial role in the identification and management of female prisoners at risk; despite this there has been little focus on the attitudes of prison staff towards female prisoners who self-harm. This paper presents such an explanation; qualitative methods were used, with semi-structured interviews with eight prison officers and five healthcare staff from one female prison in the North of England. Interviews were tape recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed iteratively, until category saturation was achieved. The data suggests that prison staff labelled self-harm as either `genuine' or `non-genuine.' Women whose self-harm was perceived as non-genuine by staff were viewed as `rational manipulators,' self-harming to achieve particular ends. Staff described feelings of resentment towards these women. Most staff reported that balancing their welfare and security functions was difficult, feeling most confident with their custody role. They described feeling untrained and unsupported in their welfare role, and pressurised due to time constraints and reported low staffing levels. This combination of factors left most staff reporting lack of confidence in dealing with women who self-harm.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Foreign body ingestion occur commonly. The majority of ingested foreign bodies will pass spontaneously. However, studies have shown that in the setting of intentional ingestion, the rate of endoscopic intervention may be much higher (63\%- 76\%) and the need for surgical intervention ranges from 12\% to 16\%. The majority of foreign body ingestions occur in the pediatric population. In adults, foreign body ingestion (i.e. non-food objects) occurs more commonly in those with psychiatric disorders, developmental delay, alcohol intoxication, and in incarcerated individuals seeking secondary gain via release to a medical facility. Methods: The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) and National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was used to determine the Emergency Department (ED) and inpatient burden of foreign body ingestion in the GI tract between 2006 and 2013. We analyzed all the patients with foreign body in the digestive system (ICD-9 code: 938), as their primary discharge diagnosis. Results: From 2006 to 2013, the number of patients presenting to the ED with foreign body ingestion in the alimentary tract increased considerably from 44,284 to 52,947. The rate of visits (per 100,000 visits) had increased from 14.8 to 16.7. The rate of admission amongst the patients presenting to the ED increased from 1\% to 1.5\%. The average length of stay (LoS) has increased from 2 to 3 days with associated significant increase in mean cost per discharge from \$4,957 to 24,314. The in-hospital mortality throughout these years remained negligible. Conclusion: Emergency department visits for foreign body ingestions have increased during the time frame analyzed. Not only the average LoS has increased, the cost associated with these hospitalizations has also increased almost five times. Increased ER presentations and hospitalizations could be due to increased incidence and prevalence of eosinophilic esophagitis, psychiatric illnesses, dietary non-compliance in patients at-risk for foreign body ingestion. We postulate that the increase in cost is likely attributed to more diagnostic and/or therapeutic interventions. More emphasis should be placed on interventions like dietary, nutrition and psychiatric counselling and closer monitoring of incarcerated individuals, to prevent further ER presentations and hospitalizations. In order to deliver more cost-conscious care, further studies to determine optimal methods to avoid these events from occuring.},

We examined the characteristics and outcomes of patients who required surgical intervention. STUDY DESIGN: Charts of all patients who underwent surgery at our institution for ingested drug packets between January 1990 and January 2005 were reviewed. Patients were identified by a pre-existing list of names collected prospectively and by admission codes. Reviewed parameters included presentation, method of diagnosis, indication for surgery, procedure, and patient outcome. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were identified, for whom charts were available for review. Main indications for surgery were drug toxicity and small bowel obstruction. Most packets were retrieved using a combination of milking and multiple enterotomies. A high rate (40\%) of postoperative wound infection was found. The incidence of wound infection correlated significantly with the number of enterotomies. CONCLUSION: Surgical intervention for body packing remains the treatment for a minority of these patients. Patients should be placed in lithotomy to facilitate the exposure of the entire gastrointestinal tract, and to allow milking of the packets and their possible retrieval through the anus. The number of enterotomies should be minimized in order to reduce the risk of wound infection. If multiple enterotomies are used, the surgeon should consider leaving the wound open for delayed closure.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The retrospective study includes patients in which urgent endoscopic investigations of the upper digestive tract were performed in a 23-year period, from 1st January 1994 to 1st January 2018. RESULTS: Altogether 13{$\mkern1mu$}196 patients were investigated: 5147 (39{$\mkern1mu\%$}) females and 8049 (61{$\mkern1mu\%$}) males, mean age 62.8 years, SD {\textpm}{$\mkern1mu$}18.5 years, range 1-106 years. In only 172 patients - 1.3{$\mkern1mu\%$} of all subjects - true foreign bodies were detected (in range from 1-8) in the esophagus or stomach. In these patients, a total of 242 endoscopic procedures were performed. In 95.9{$\mkern1mu\%$} the foreign bodies were removed endoscopically (165/172 patients); in 7 cases (4.1{$\mkern1mu\%$}) the endoscopic procedures were not successful. Among the foreign bodies removed were various metal or plastic objects: hooks, batteries, coins, keys, screws, razor blades, lighters, buttons, toys, 3 toothbrushes as well as impacted safety pins. In patients with successful endoscopic removal, no significant complications were noted. In 12~patients (12/165, 7.2{$\mkern1mu\%$}), hemorrhages from the region of the esophagogastric junction or stomach were observed; endoscopic hemostasis was performed in 10/12 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Urgent endoscopy has proved successful in removing true foreign bodies from the upper gastrointestinal tract in the analyzed period. Different factors affect the success of urgent intervention, the most important being adequate experience, skills, and patience of the endoscopic team.},

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Surgical wounds that become infected are often debrided because clinicians believe that removal of this necrotic or infected tissue may expedite wound healing. There are numerous methods of debridement available, but no consensus on which one is most effective for surgical wounds. Objectives To assess the effects of different methods of debridement on the rate of debridement and healing of surgical wounds. Search methods In October 2021, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. To identify additional studies, we searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies, reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology reports. There were no restrictions on language, date of publication, or study setting. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people with a surgical wound that required debridement, and reported time to complete wound debridement or time to wound healing, or both. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment using the RoB 1 tool, data extraction, and GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence. Main results In this fourth update, we identified one additional study for inclusion. The review now includes six studies, with 265 participants, aged three to 91 years. Five studies were published between 1979 and 1990 and one published in 2014. The studies were carried out in hospital settings in China, Denmark, Belgium, and the UK. Six studies provided six comparisons. Due to the heterogeneity of studies, it was not appropriate to conduct meta-analyses. Four studies evaluated the effectiveness of dextranomer beads/paste; however, each study used a different comparator (Eusol-soaked dressings, 10\% aqueous polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1\% chloramine-soaked packs, and silicone foam elastomer dressing). One study compared streptokinase/streptodornase with saline-soaked dressings, and one compared endoscopic surgical debridement with conventional 'open' surgical debridement. Five studies reported time to complete debridement (reported as time to a clean wound bed) and three reported time to complete healing. One study reported effect estimates (surgical debridement via endoscopy versus surgical debridement) for time to a clean wound bed and time to complete wound healing, and it was possible to calculate effect estimates for one other study (dextranomer paste versus silicone foam elastomer) for time to complete wound healing. For the other four studies that did not report effect estimates, it was not possible to calculate time to a clean wound bed or time to complete wound healing due to missing variance and participant exclusions. None of the included studies reported outcomes pertaining to proportion of wounds completely healed, rate of reduction in wound size, rate of infection, or quality of life. All studies had unclear or high risk of bias for at least one key domain. Dextranomer paste/beads (autolytic debridement) compared with four different comparators Four studies compared dextranomer paste or beads with Eusol-soaked gauze (20 participants), 10\% aqueous polyvinylpyrrolidone (40 participants), 0.1\% chloramine-soaked dressings (28 participants), or silicone foam elastomer (50 participants). There is very low-certainty evidence that there may be no clear difference in time to a clean wound bed between dextranomer beads and Eusol gauze. The study did not report adverse events. There is very low-certainty evidence that there may be no difference in time to a clean wound bed between dextranomer paste and 10\% aqueous polyvinylpyrrolidone gauze. There was low-certainty evidence that there may be no difference in deaths and serious adverse events. There may be a difference in time until the wounds were clinically clean and time to complete wound healing between dextranomer paste and 0.1\% chloramine favouring 0.1\% chloramine, but we are very uncertain. There is low-certainty evidence that there may be no difference in deaths and serious adverse events. There is very low-certainty evidence that there may be no difference in time to complete healing between dextranomer beads and silicone foam elastomer. The study did not report adverse events. Streptokinase/streptodornase solution (enzymatic) compared with saline-soaked dressings One study (21 participants) compared enzymatic debridement with saline-soaked dressings. There is low-certainty evidence that there may be no difference in time to a clean wound bed or secondary suture between streptokinase/streptodornase and saline-soaked dressings. There is very low-certainty evidence that there may be no difference in deaths and serious adverse events. Surgical debridement via endoscopic ('keyhole') surgery compared with surgical debridement by 'open' surgery (the wound is opened using a scalpel) One study (106 participants) reported time to complete wound healing and time to a clean wound bed. There is low-certainty evidence that there may be a reduction in time to complete wound healing and very low-certainty evidence that there may be no difference in time to a clean wound bed with surgical debridement via endoscopy compared to 'open' surgical debridement. The study did not report adverse events. Overall, the evidence was low to very low-certainty for all outcomes. Five included studies were published before 1991 and investigated treatments that are no longer available. Worldwide production of dextranomer products has been discontinued, except for dextranomer paste, which is currently only available in South Africa. Furthermore, Eusol, used in one study as the comparator to dextranomer, is rarely used due to risk of harmful effects on healthy tissue and the enzymatic agent streptokinase/streptodornase is no longer available worldwide. Authors' conclusions Evidence for the effects of different methods of debridement on complete wound debridement and healing of surgical wounds remains unclear. Adequately powered, methodologically robust RCTs evaluating contemporary debridement interventions for surgical wounds are needed to guide clinical decision-making. Plain language summary Is there a best way to remove dead tissue from surgical wounds? Key message We cannot be certain whether removal of dead or infected tissue of surgical wounds or care that is usually provided makes any difference to how long it takes to remove all of the dead tissue from the wound and for the wound to heal. What did we want to find out? Following surgery, most surgical wounds heal naturally with no complications. However, complications such as infection can occur, which may result in delayed healing. There are many different methods of removing dead or infected tissue (called debridement), such as surgical removal of the tissue, enzymes (naturally occurring proteins that dissolve the tissue), and mechanical methods (for example, a special dry gauze that is removed when the tissue has stuck to it). We wanted to look at the different ways to remove dead or infected tissue from wounds after surgical operations and find out how they affect the time it takes to remove all of the dead tissue from the wound and for the wound to heal. What did we do? We searched medical databases for well-designed studies including people of any age that compared one method of debridement versus a dummy treatment (placebo), no treatment, or another method of debridement after surgery. What did we find? We found six studies dating from 1979 to 2014 that compared different types of wound debridement with the way care was usually provided for wounds that had dead tissue within them after surgery. All six studies compared different types of debridement methods or different types of usual care, meaning we could not combine the results. The total number of participants within the studies was 265, and ages of participants ranged from three to 91 years. The studies were carried out in hospitals in China, Denmark, Belgium, and the UK. Four studies compared a treatment method that promotes the body's natural wound healing process (called autolytic) with different types of usual care. Overall, we found that this method may make little or no difference to how long it takes to remove all of the dead tissue. One study compared an enzyme with usual care, and we found that this method may make little or no difference to how long it takes to remove all of the dead tissue. One study compared different methods of removing dead tissue using surgery (one via 'keyhole' surgery, the other 'normal' surgery). We found that using keyhole surgery to remove the dead tissue may have little or no effect on time for the wound to heal, but we are very uncertain about the results. Only three of the studies (two autolytic and one using an enzyme) reported serious harmful events that led to discontinuation of treatment or hospital admission. There may be no difference in deaths and serious harmful events between the treatment methods. Overall, all the studies indicated that it is unclear whether any type of wound debridement is better than usual care at reducing time to remove all of the dead tissue, time to complete healing, serious harmful events that led to discontinuation of treatment, or hospital admission. What are the limitations of the evidence? Overall, we are very uncertain about the evidence, mainly because the studies had small numbers of people, and did not report the results well. Additionally, five studies used debridement products that are no longer used clinically. How up to date is the evidence? We searched for studies published up to October 2021.},

METHODS: Children {$<$}18years  old who ingested a magnet were reviewed from 1/2011 to 6/2016 from two tertiary  center children's hospitals. Demographics, symptoms, management and outcomes were  analyzed. RESULTS: From 2011 to 2016, there were 89 magnet ingestions (50 from  hospital 1 and 39 from hospital 2); 50 (56\%) were males. Median age was 7.9  (4.0-12.0) years; 60 (67\%) presented with multiple magnets or a magnet and a  second metallic co-ingestion. Suspected locations found on imaging were: stomach  (53\%), small bowel (38\%), colon (23\%) and esophagus (3\%). Only 35 patients (39\%)  presented with symptoms and the most common symptom was abdominal pain (33\%). 42  (47\%) patients underwent an intervention, in which 20 (23\%) had an abdominal  operation. For those undergoing abdominal surgery, an exact logistic regression  model identified multiple magnets or a magnet and a second metallic object  co-ingestion (OR 12.9; 95\% CI, 2.4 - Infinity) and abdominal pain (OR 13.0; 95\%  CI, 3.2-67.8) as independent risk factors. CONCLUSION: Magnets have a high risk  of requiring surgical intervention for removal. Therefore, we developed a  management algorithm for magnet ingestion. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.},

The results were extremely heterogeneous, mostly depending on the different migrant group considered. Significant differences in suicide risk have been found depending on the legal status of migrants and their country of origin/migration. The second section explored the protective and risk factors for suicidal ideation and behaviours in different migrant groups. The analysis concluded that a set of factors may interact in various ways, contributing to a heterogeneous and complex framework underpinning the phenomenon of suicide. Migration itself may be a challenging and traumatizing experience, characterized by social isolation, cultural dislocation and adjustment, as well as economic and financial distress, all of which may exacerbate pre-existing mental health vulnerabilities or trigger new mental disorders. Acculturative stress, discrimination, and language barriers further compound these challenges, often hindering access to mental health services.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The natural course after foreign body (FB) ingestion is uneventful in majority of cases and an 'intelligent neglect' approach is favored. In a fraction of patients, FB ingestion can be a medical emergency with risk for fatal complications. Literature regarding success rates and complications of upper gastrointestinal FB extraction in adults is sparse. Methods: As a large tertiary care teaching hospital, we retrospectively reviewed charts of patients who presented with FB ingestion from 2011-2014. Demographics, ingestion characteristics, and outcome measurements were collected. Chi-Square test was used to investigate associations between these variables. Results: 260 patients presented with FB ingestion: 160 (61.5\%) men, mean age 60 years ({\textpm} 20.03), median age for accidental ingestion 61 years, purposeful ingestion 34 years. Ingestion was accidental in 95\%, ingested material was food bolus in 92\%, and intervention required intubation in 51\% of cases. The main symptom from FB ingestion was dysphagia (94\%). 22\% had an underlying psychiatric disorder; depression (n=43), anxiety (n=20) and bipolar disorder (n=15). Esophageal abnormalities were present in 79\% of patients at the time of endoscopy; majority was structural (92\%). Incidental findings during endoscopy included stricture (35\%), Schatzki's ring (29\%), hiatal hernia (25\%), ringed esophagus (22\%) GERD (5\%), Barret's esophagus (5\%) and malignancy (4\%). A biopsy was performed at the time of procedure for 90 patients; 40\% of this group had ringed esophagus. Compared to patients without a ringed esophagus, those that did had a higher proportion of eosinophilic esophagitis (25\% and 58\%, respectively;p=0.002). Of the 260 patients, 200 patients received intervention in ER, 46 patients as inpatient and 14 patients, as outpatient. All interventions that were done in ER were successful. Success rate of inpatient procedures was 89\%, outpatient 93\% with overall success rate 98\%. Flexible esophagogastroduodenoscopy was the mode of intervention in majority (n=252) with success rate 98\%. Frequency of location of FB with outcome is shown in figure 1. Specific complications of the procedure were bleeding 1.5\%, perforation 1.9\% aspiration pneumonia, 1.5\% and post procedure hospitalization (6.1\%). There were no reports of stricture, fistula, diverticula or abscess. Conclusions: Our study shows that flexible endoscopes have high success rates with minimal complications. During the study period, all patients presenting to our hospital underwent interventional endoscopy and it was found that the risk of complications was extremely low, proportion of successful removal was high, identified underlying abnormalities and facilitated biopsies. There was a statistically significant association between ringed esophagus and eosinophilic esophagitis, signifying the importance of biopsy at the time of endoscopy. (Figure presented).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The concept of a spectrum of obsessive-compulsive related disorders may have clinical and research heuristic value in the approach to disorders similar to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in respect of phenomenology and psychobiology. Like other repetitive and ritualistic behaviours, pica may be postulated to fall at times on this spectrum. METHODS: Five cases of pica seen at our clinics are presented here in order to test this hypothesis. Phenomenology, neurobiology (where available) and pharmacotherapy data are provided in order to consider a possible relationship with OCD and OCD spectrum disorders. RESULTS: In 2 of the cases, pica appeared to be a compulsion and patients had additional symptoms which met diagnostic criteria for OCD. In 2 of the cases, the clinical picture and neurobiological data were reminiscent of an impulse control disorder. Four of the 5 patients responded to treatment with a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SRI). CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with a hypothesis that at least some cases of pica may usefully be conceptualised as lying within a compulsive-impulsive spectrum of symptoms and disorders.},

Methods An extensive literature search was carried out to generate conclusions on key management questions for food bolus and oesophageal foreign bodies. This was then summarised into both a written summary of the evidence and a graphical decision tree. Results This paper is a review article and presents conclusions regarding management options for food bolus and oesophageal foreign bodies. Conclusion This article considers the current evidence surrounding investigation and management of oesophageal food bolus and foreign body. It draws conclusions regarding presentation, investigation and subsequent operative treatment. As part of this process, we propose a graphical decision tree to assist in management decisions.},

This article reports a  single surgeon's experience of endoscopic retrieval of foreign bodies from the  upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract. Methods A retrospective analysis of data of  all the patients who underwent endoscopic management for foreign body removal by  a single surgeon in a tertiary care hospital in southern India between 2015 and  2020 was conducted. Patient variables in terms of age, sex, type of foreign body,  its location in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the time between ingestion and  presentation, the time between presentation and endoscopy, treatment outcomes  were reviewed. Results A total of 97 patients were studied. The age range of the  patients studied was one month to 71 years. Males were predominant (n=64,  65.97\%). The most common retrieved foreign body were coins (n=31, 31.9\%). The  most common site of foreign body lodgment was the esophagus (n=75, 77.31\%), with  the upper third esophagus (n=38; 39.37\%) being the predominant site. The success  rate of endoscopic retrieval in our study was 97\%. No procedure-related  complications were encountered in any patient. Endoscopic management failed in  two patients who ultimately required surgical intervention. Conclusion Endoscopic  retrieval of foreign bodies in the UGI tract is a safe and effective modality.  Early endoscopy in such patients avoids surgical intervention and reduces  morbidity.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: A bezoar is an indigestible food or other material within the gastrointestinal tract. It can be ingested intentionally or  accidentally. The small bowel bezoar prevalence ranges between 0.4~\% and 4~\%, and  the prevalence is less than 0.5~\% for gastric bezoars. There are different types  of bezoars, but the mention of a plastic bezoar rarely appears in the literature.  To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a plastic bezoar in the  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old woman was admitted for  acute kidney injury, and while working her up, it was discovered that she had a  possible foreign body on computerized tomography scan. As a result, she underwent  exploratory laparotomy with the findings of plastic foreign objects identified  90~cm from the ileocecal valve and other objects identified in the stomach.  CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The impaction of these materials often occurs in narrow  areas such as the lower esophagus, duodenum, ileocecal valve or even the anus. In  this unique case, two points of impaction were noted: the first was in the small  bowel and the second point in the stomach. The approach to such cases could be  Endoscopic versus surgical or even chemical dissolution as a choice of treatment  is dependent on multiple factors. CONCLUSION: The approach to these cases is  multidisciplinary and depends on the availability of services and resources at  the treating hospital. Reporting such cases helps in managing challenging  situations. Additionally, a psychiatric assessment is a crucial step.},

  abstract = {Background: Even though asylum seekers are considered vulnerable to mental ill-health, knowledge of their suicidal behaviour is limited. The aim of this study was to improve our understanding of factors that influence the clinical assessment of asylum seekers who have attempted suicide compared to the assessment of non-asylum seekers. Methods: The study focused on 88 asylum seekers registered for suicide attempts in mental health services 2005--2009, who were matched for age and gender and compared with 88 suicide attempters with Swedish personal identity numbers. The medical records were analysed with a quantitative protocol, focusing on social risk and protective factors, health history, current clinical picture as well as the assessment procedure, diagnostics, patterns of treatment and follow-up in this clinical group. Data was analysed using the chi-square test, Fisher's exact probability test, and the Mann--Whitney U test. Results: As in earlier studies, asylum seekers were more traumatized, had different social risk factors and received different diagnoses than the controls. Asylum seekers were referred to less specialized follow-up after treatment, in spite of their health history and of previous and current clinical pictures indicating a similar or - in the case of the female asylum seekers - more serious mental health condition. Female asylum seekers also received more intense and prolonged in-patient treatment than female controls. Asylum seekers appeared to have social networks more often than the control group. However, there was less documentation of the social context, previous suicidal behaviour, and on suicide in the family and close environment of the asylum-seeking men. Information on suicidal intent was lacking in a majority of both groups. The time relation of the suicide attempt and the asylum process suggested the importance of the asylum decision, as well as the possible role of earlier mental health problems and premigration stress, for the suicidal behaviour. Conclusions: The groups had different sets of risk factors and clinical pictures. There was a lack of early and thorough exploration of suicide intent for both groups, and of contextual and subjective factors for the asylum seekers. Differences in follow-up indicate unequal access to care.},

AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the predictive risk factors associated with the complications of oesophageal foreign bodies. METHODS: Three hundred sixteen cases with foreign bodies in the oesophagus were retrospectively investigated. The predictive risk factors for complications after foreign body ingestion were analysed by multivariate logistic regression, and included age, size and type of foreign body ingested, duration of impaction, and the level of foreign body impaction. RESULTS: The types of oesophageal foreign bodies included fish bones (37.0\%), food (19.0\%), and metals (18.4\%). The complications associated with foreign bodies were ulcers (21.2\%), lacerations (14.9\%), erosions (12.0\%), and perforation (1.9\%). Multivariate analysis showed that the duration of impaction (p{$<$}0.001), and the type (p{$<$}0.001) and size of the foreign bodies (p{$<$}0.001) were significant independent risk factors associated with the development of complications in patients with oesophageal foreign bodies.

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Nasal pharyngolaryngoscopy (NPL) is performed as an outpatient and inpatient procedure on a daily basis, for a variety of indications. It frequently causes some degree of discomfort to the patient. Various different topical agents, which are intended to reduce this discomfort, are in common use. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of the various agents. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of topical preparations used to reduce discomfort and facilitate NPL in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 14 April 2010. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) looking at the effect of topical anaesthetic or vasoconstrictor agents used reduce discomfort and facilitate NPL in adult patients. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for further information where necessary. The primary outcome measured was pain/discomfort. Secondary outcomes that were looked at included side effects of the topical medications, ease of the procedure and the quality of the view from the operator's perspective. Main results We included eight RCTs (746 participants) in the review. The risk of bias in the studies was generally low. Five studies did not demonstrate any advantage in using a topical treatment prior to endoscopy. One study suggested that a vasoconstrictor alone should be used to reduce the general level of unpleasantness. Two studies did not compare treatment against placebo or no treatment, so it was not possible to draw meaningful conclusions from them. There may be some unpleasant side effects from the use of topical preparations, such as unpleasant taste. There was variation in the format of the outcome data and a lack of complete data; none of the included studies reported their results in a way that would allow pooling and we could not therefore perform meta-analysis. Authors' conclusions The included studies do not demonstrate any evidence to support the use of topical treatments prior to the use of a fibre-optic nasal endoscope. Some go as far as to suggest that these agents should not be used due to cost and unpleasant side effects. Five studies did not demonstrate any advantage in terms of reducing pain or discomfort when using a topical treatment prior to endoscopy. The absence of demonstrable effect may be due to relatively small patient groups. It is therefore possible that there is a small effect of using these sprays. Further research using standardised reporting methods is needed. Plain language summary Topical anaesthetic or vasoconstrictor (blood vessel narrowing) preparations for flexible fibre-optic nasal pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy Topical medications are often applied to the inside of a patient's nose prior to examining the nose, sinuses and throat with a flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscope. The aim of this is to reduce any discomfort the patient may feel and also to improve the adequacy of the examination. Types of preparation include lidocaine, phenylephrine and lidocaine, oxymetazoline, xylometazoline and cocaine and they are usually administered as a spray, although they may also be in the form of a solution which can be applied to cotton wool and placed in the nasal cavity, or as gels, pastes or creams. We looked for randomised controlled trials comparing any of these topical treatments with placebo, no treatment or another topical treatment in adult patients undergoing nasal pharyngolaryngoscopy (NPL). We included eight studies in the review (with a total of 746 patients). It was not possible to combine data from any of the studies, therefore we assessed the individual study results. Five of the studies did not demonstrate any advantage, in terms of reducing pain or discomfort, of using a topical treatment prior to endoscopy. One of these suggested that a vasoconstrictor (xylometazoline) alone reduced the level of "general unpleasantness". Two studies did not compare the treatment against placebo or no treatment. A final study actually suggested an increase in pain with the use of topical agents. There may be some unpleasant side effects from the use of topical preparations, such as unpleasant taste. Further standardised research is required.},

Approximately 1500 people in the United States die from ingestion  of foreign bodies annually. Patients with cognitive disabilities, neurological  disorders, elderly age or incarcerated patients carry the highest risk of  intentional and/or accidental ingestion of foreign objects. Although uncommon,  ingestion of foreign objects during dental procedures can be potentially  life-threatening and increased awareness is important. Sharp objects ingested  from dental procedures can cause impaction, obstruction, hemorrhage, or  perforation and may need endoscopic or surgical intervention.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coins are made of metal, which is generally radiopaque, and so physicians often have the misconception that all coins are detectable by  radiography. Here, we report a case of intentionally swallowed coins in the  oesophagus of an adult; the coins could not be detected on chest radiography but  were detected using computed tomography (CT). CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old  woman with a history of depression presented to the emergency department after an  intentional medication overdose and ingestion of two Japanese 1-yen coins. She  complained of persistent retrosternal discomfort. In order to confirm whether the  coins were in the oesophagus or trachea, an anteroposterior chest radiograph was  obtained; however, no coins were detected. Owing to her persistent symptoms, a  chest CT was performed. On the initial CT scan, two 1-yen coins were observed in  the oesophagus: one in the middle oesophagus and the other in the lower  oesophagus. After the scanning, the patient drank water with permission, but  vomited. No coins were found in her vomit, and the symptoms of retrosternal  discomfort had completely disappeared. A subsequent CT scan revealed that the two  1-yen coins were in the patient's stomach. CONCLUSIONS: Japanese 1-yen coins are  made of 100\% aluminium, which is less radiopaque than the metals that make up  coins (nickel, bronze, and lead), and so, they were not visible via chest  radiography in our case. Detecting very small or thin radiolucent foreign bodies  is not possible using a chest radiograph or contrast oesophagram, but is possible  via CT. CT is both increasingly convenient and non-invasive, unlike endoscopy or  bronchoscopy, and so, the use of CT scans should be considered in cases of  possible radiolucent foreign body ingestion.},

Background and Aim: Foreign body ingestion is a common cause for emergency department presentation. In adults, foreign body ingestion is more common in patients with underlying psychiatric comorbidity, the elderly, alcohol intoxication and prisoners. This study reviewed the management of patients presenting to a tertiary hospital with foreign body ingestion. Methods: A retrospective review of patients presenting with foreign body ingestion to a tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Victoria, was undertaken from January 2017 to December 2021. Patients were identified through medical records and data collected included patient demographics, descriptive data on the type of foreign body, length of stay, imaging modalities, management strategies and complications. Results: A total of 157 presentations by 62 patients with foreign body ingestion occurred between 2017 and 2021 (50\% male; median age 30 years). 82\% of patients had underlying psychiatric comorbidity and two-thirds had a previous history of self-harm. The majority of presentations occurred in prisoners (65\%). The most commonly ingested objects were batteries (23\%), alleged drug-containing balloons (17\%), razor blades (16\%), magnets (4\%) and miscellaneous (40\%) (Figure 1). High-risk ingestion, defined as sharp objects, length {$>$}5cm, diameter {$>$}2.5cm, button battery and/or magnet ingestion, and oesophageal location occurred in approximately two thirds of presentations. Most presentations (90\%) underwent radiological evaluation on admission, with the majority (67\%) having plain radiographs. Conservative management, defined as inpatient or outpatient observation, was the most common approach in 55\%. High-risk ingestions were more likely to be managed endoscopically compared with low-risk ingestions (51\% vs. 26\%; p=0.002). Patients presenting with high-risk ingestion were equally likely to be managed conservatively as they were endoscopically (46\% vs. 51\%; p=0.549). The median time to endoscopy in patients with high-risk foreign body located in the stomach was 19 hours. The median length of stay for all presentations was 2 days and did not differ between patients receiving conservative vs. endoscopic management (median 2.1 vs. 2.4 days). Complications, defined as perforation, bowel obstruction or fistula formation, did not occur in this cohort despite more than a half presenting with high-risk ingestions. 30-day re-presentation rates were high (31\%) and re-presentation rates did not differ between patients managed conservatively and endoscopically (29\% vs. 33\%; p=0.787). Conclusion: Conservative management for patients presenting with recurrent high-risk foreign body ingestion was safe in appropriately selected cases (Figure 2).

We present the case of a 26-year-old man who was brought from a  correctional facility after confessing to have swallowed a few shower curtain  hooks. Abdominal X-ray done in the emergency room revealed multiple foreign  bodies in the stomach. An upper endoscopy was done in the emergency room with the  use of an overtube. The first metal piece was caught by a snare and removed with  the endoscope. All other foreign bodies which were present on the abdominal X-ray  could not be visualized initially as there was retained food in the stomach.  After multiple attempts, four other foreign bodies were found and each one was  caught by the forceps and then the scope was removed with the forceps holding the  foreign body. There was an additional foreign body in the right mainstem  bronchus. The patient had coughed up the foreign body and swallowed it into the  gastrointestinal tract. A computed tomography scan of chest and abdomen was done  for evaluation, which showed the foreign body in the cecum. To our knowledge,  this is the first case report of a patient intentionally transferring a foreign  body from one organ system to another.

We aimed to analyze the different etiologies and clinical characteristics of acute  non-traumatic colon perforation beyond the neonatal period and to identify  surgical management and outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective study included 18  patients admitted with acute colon perforation and who received surgical  treatment. RESULTS: Age of patients ranged between 1 month and 15 years. Five  patients swallowed foreign objects (two swallowed magnets), two had colon  perforation secondary to a malignant tumor (both colorectal adenocarcinoma) and  two were iatrogenic (one prior colonoscopy, one air enema for intussusception).  There was one perforation due to chemotherapy and Amyand's hernia respectively.  The remaining seven patients had unknown etiologies; five of them were diagnosed  with colitis. Fifteen (83.3\,\%) patients underwent open laparotomy, among which  four attempted laparoscopy first. Three (16.7\,\%) patients underwent laparoscopic  surgery. Fourteen (77.8\,\%) patients received simple suture repairs and four  (22.2\,\%) received colonic resections and anastomosis. Four (22.2\,\%) patients  received a protective diverting colostomy and three (16.7\,\%) received an  ileostomy. CONCLUSIONS: There is a wide range of etiology besides necrotizing  enterocolitis and trauma, but a significant portion of children present with  unknown etiology.

  abstract = {Objective: Self-harm and attempted suicide are risk factors for suicide in psychiatric hospital in-patients. This study aimed to analyse the circumstances of self-harm and suicide attempts in a Japanese psychiatric hospital so as to improve management and care. Methods: Incident reports of self-harm and suicide attempts during a 12.4-year period from November 2000 to March 2013 were reviewed. A descriptive analysis was conducted in terms of age, sex, and diagnosis of patients, as well as level, ward, situations, and causes of incidents. Results: During the study period, 90 cases of self-harm and attempted suicide involving 58 patients were reported. The rate of self-harm and suicide attempts was 0.05 per 1000 patient-days. The types of self-harm and suicide attempts included hanging (n = 25), wrist cutting (n = 19), ingestion of foreign objects (n = 17), and others (n = 29). The single case of completed suicide involved hanging, in a patient with schizophrenia. Among 55 patients with relevant data, the most common clinical diagnosis was mood disorder (41.8\%), followed by schizophrenia (36.4\%). Mood disorder was 3.5 times as prevalent in females as in males (14 vs. 4). Fourteen patients with mood disorder (n = 8) or schizophrenia (n = 6) were repeatedly involved in 46 of 89 cases of self-harm or attempted suicide; 11 were female. One woman with mood disorder attempted suicide 9 times within the same year. The top 3 management and care factors related to self-harm and suicide attempts were failure to adhere to preventive procedures (28\%), insufficient therapeutic communication (28\%), and difficulty in predicting suicide (20\%). Conclusion: Self-harm and suicide attempts at this psychiatric hospital occurred at a rate of 0.05 per 1000 patient-days between late 2000 and early 2013. Efforts are needed to increase compliance with suicide prevention procedures and therapeutic communication, so as to improve management and care of psychiatric in-patients and prevent them from committing suicide.

METHODS: Assuming aggregate-level data, we focus on two topics: (1) estimation of heterogeneity using commonly used methods in preclinical meta-analysis: method of moments (DerSimonian and Laird; DL), maximum likelihood (restricted maximum likelihood; REML) and Bayesian approach; (2) comparison of univariate versus multivariable meta-regression for adjusting estimated treatment effects for heterogeneity. Using data from a systematic review on the efficacy of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in animals with stroke, we compare these methods, and explore the impact of multiple covariates on the treatment effects. RESULTS: We observed that the three methods for estimating heterogeneity yielded similar estimates for the overall effect, but different estimates for between-study variability. The proportion of heterogeneity explained by a covariate is estimated larger using REML and the Bayesian method as compared with DL. Multivariable meta-regression explains more heterogeneity than univariate meta-regression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the importance of careful selection of the estimation method and the use of multivariable meta-regression to explain heterogeneity. There was no difference between REML and the Bayesian method and both methods are recommended over DL. Multiple meta-regression is worthwhile to explain heterogeneity by more than one variable, reducing more variability than any univariate models and increasing the explained proportion of heterogeneity.},

A 41-year-old male patient with intellectual disabilities presented after having swallowed approximately 20 sharp objects. While admitted to a psychiatric ward, surgeons removed a glove from his stomach endoscopically and pharmacologically facilitated the objects' complication-free bowel passage. The patient explained the swallowing as a means to release himself from tension induced by stress. His aberrant behavior also seemed to serve as a means to exert pressure on psychosocial workers. Other deviations included the pushing of sharp objects under the skin and multiple paraphiliae. As a child, the patient suffered from early psychological and physical traumatization. Both parents were allegedly physically abusive alcoholics., Conclusion. Apart from possible alcohol embryopathy and traumatic brain damage, meningitis, which the patient had at the age of three, is discussed as the most likely reason for his oligophrenia, associated with left-sided, temporo-parietal atrophy and epilepsy.},

They are frequently inadvertently placed by children in their ears or noses and  occasionally are swallowed and lodged along the upper aerodigestive tract. The  purpose of this work is to study the different presentations of button battery  foreign bodies and present our experience in the diagnosis and management of this  hazardous problem in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 13  patients. The diagnostic protocol was comprised of a thorough history, head and  neck physical examination, and appropriate radiographic evaluation. The button  batteries were emergently extracted under general anesthesia. RESULTS: The  average follow-up period was 4.3 months. Five patients had a nasal button  battery. Four patients had an esophageal button battery. Three patients had a  button battery in the stomach. One patient had a button battery impacted in the  left external ear canal. Apart from a nasal septal perforation and a tympanic  membrane perforation, no major complications were detected. CONCLUSION: Early  detection is the key in the management of button battery foreign bodies. They  have a distinctive appearance on radiography, and its prompt removal is  mandatory, especially for batteries lodged in the esophagus. Physicians must  recognize the hazardous potential and serious implications of such an accident.  There is a need for more public education about this serious problem.},

This postal survey and interview study sought to identify risk factors in adults with learning disabilities who have histories of choking. Method. A total of 2000 questionnaires were sent to carers of all adults with learning disabilities registered as service users by three local health authorities. (A 'service user' may be using any specialist learning disability health or social care facility with day, residential or therapeutic services). Of the 674 service users for whom surveys were returned, 47 were living in hospital, 396 were living in residential or group homes and 208 were living with relatives, or in their own homes. Eighteen subjects who had reported serious or repeated episodes of choking were interviewed in depth in their residences or workplaces. Responses were subjected to frequency analyses. Personal characteristics were analysed. Choking patterns were differentiated by food texture. Results. A total of 34\% of questionnaires on 674 service users were returned; 42\% of respondents reported one or more choking episodes. There was a significantly greater occurrence of choking among people with more severe learning disability, with Down syndrome, people who had an incomplete dentition or were taking a greater number of psychotropic drugs. Antisocial eating habits learnt in institutional settings presented an additional choking hazard for some individuals. Conclusion. Choking is a serious hazard for many adults with learning disabilities. This study establishes many of the characteristics associated with swallowing problems in this population. Clinicians and carers should benefit from awareness of these predictors, leading to better management of eating behaviours and habits. A choking and swallowing risk assessment should be included in routine health assessments of adults with learning disability, paying especial attention to the condition of a person's teeth; possible side effects from prescribed medication, and abnormal eating behaviour.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As a significant proportion of patients receiving palliative care suffer from states of anxiety, depression, delirium, or other mental symptoms, psychiatry and palliative care already collaborate closely in the palliative care of medical conditions. Despite this well-established involvement of psychiatrists in palliative care, psychiatry does not currently explicitly provide palliative care for patients with mental illness outside the context of terminal medical illness. DISCUSSION: Based on the WHO definition of palliative care, a, a working definition of palliative psychiatry is proposed. Palliative psychiatry focuses on mental health rather than medical/physical issues. We propose that the beneficiaries of palliative psychiatry are patients with severe persistent mental illness, who are at risk of therapeutic neglect and/or overly aggressive care within current paradigms. These include long-term residential care patients with severe chronic schizophrenia and insufficient quality of life, those with therapy-refractory depressions and repeated suicide attempts, and those with severe long-standing therapy-refractory anorexia nervosa. An explicitly palliative approach within psychiatry has the potential to improve quality of care, person-centredness, outcomes, and autonomy for patients with severe persistent mental illness. CONCLUSIONS: The first step towards a palliative psychiatry is to acknowledge those palliative approaches that already exist implicitly in psychiatry. Basic skills for a palliative psychiatry include communication of diagnosis and prognosis, symptom assessment and management, support for advance (mental health) care planning, assessment of caregiver needs, and referral to specialized services. Some of these may already be considered core skills of psychiatrists, but for a truly palliative approach they should be exercised guided by an awareness of the limited functional prognosis and lifespan of patients with severe persistent mental illness.},

  abstract = {Deliberate foreign body ingestion is a significant issue in prison and psychiatric settings. It is associated with serious physical complications, including bowel obstruction, perforation and haemorrhage. Episodes of deliberate foreign body ingestion were identified retrospectively from 5417 incident records from two inpatient forensic services (one mental health and one intellectual disability) over a one year timeframe, using related search terms. Rates were compared according to gender, diagnosis and level of security. Incidents of deliberate foreign body ingestion were found to occur on average every 2.7 days across the study population, with 133 incidents recorded over a one year period, accounted for by 27 patients. Women and patients in lower levels of security were significantly more likely to engage in deliberate foreign body ingestion. Staff responses to this behaviour were highly variable. Deliberate foreign body ingestion occurs frequently within inpatient forensic services, and can have significantly detrimental physical implications for affected patients. Further research should investigate the psychiatric and intellectual disability profile of such individuals in further detail, as well as exploring patient narratives; both of which will help inform development of treatment strategies.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Despite the effectiveness of endoscopies in removing ingested foreign bodies (FBs) impacted in the esophagus, the merits and limitations of  flexible endoscopy (FE) and rigid endoscopy (RE) remain unclear. Therefore, this  study compares the advantages and disadvantages of both endoscopic procedures  from a clinical perspective. METHODS: A retrospective review was made of 273  patients suspected of esophageal FBs in emergency consultations of a tertiary  medical referral center from March 2010 to March 2014. All patients received  routine physical examinations, otolaryngological examinations, and X-rays of the  neck and chest. The door-to-endoscopy time, procedure time, postendoscopic  hospital stay, successful removal rates, and complications were analyzed as well.  RESULTS: In this study, the most common esophageal FBs were fish and animal bones  (76\%) in adults and coins (74\%) in children. The patients with existing  esophageal FBs had significantly more frequent symptoms of dysphagia and signs of  linear opacity as detected with lateral neck radiography than those without FB.  Additionally, the door-to-endoscopy time, procedure time, and postendoscopic  hospital stay was significantly shorter in FE patients than in RE patients.  However, both RE and FE patients had high rates of successful FB removal (95\%)  and low complication rates (2\%). CONCLUSION: Both FE and RE remove esophageal FBs  successfully, as evidenced by their high success rates, low complication rates,  and high detection rates. Although FE under local anesthesia is a less  time-consuming procedure for adults, RE under general anesthesia may be  preferable for children and can serve as an alternative to FE.},

However, multiple sharply pointed foreign bodies located in different organs are rare conditions and no definite treatment guidelines has been established. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 31-year-old amateur magician visited the outpatient clinic with a chief complaint of epigastric discomfort. He might have accidentally swallowed some needles while practicing a magic trick 2 days before. DIAGNOSIS: Imaging tests revealed 1 needle was stuck in the left liver lobe through the stomach wall, 1 was in the third portion of the duodenum, 3 were in the ascending colon, and 2 were in the transverse colon. INTERVENTIONS: A needle in the duodenum and 5 in the colon were removed by endoscopy. The needle stuck in the liver from the stomach was not visible inside the stomach and was successfully removed by laparoscopy a few days later. OUTCOMES: The patient was able to tolerate an oral diet and was discharged on postoperative day 4 without any complications. LESSONS: Developing a treatment plan in cases of multiple sharp FB may be difficult. A multidisciplinary team of endoscopists and surgeons is needed to determine the best possible treatment plan. This experience illustrates the importance of the planning of the sequence and method of removal of multiple foreign bodies from the gastrointestinal tract.},

Plain radiograph and CT scan showed metal density suggesting a  foreign body in the lower right abdomen. A diagnostic laparoscopic procedure  identified a perforated appendicitis due to a needle perforation. Laparoscopic  appendicectomy and foreign body removal were performed. DISCUSSION: Acute  appendicitis due foreign body ingestion is extremely rare. Laparoscopy was the  chosen access once it was more suitable for inventory of the gastrointestinal  tract and help avoiding harm of the medical team during hand maneuvers of open  access surgery. CONCLUSION: Foreign body ingestion should be remembered as an  unusual differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis.},

An  echocardiogram was performed revealing a left atrial mass concerning for myxoma.  During the surgical removal of the mass, a hypodermic needle was found attached  to the roof of the left atrium surrounded by thrombotic and fibrotic tissue,  which was confirmed by pathology. DISCUSSION: Cardiac FBs are caused generally by  penetrating wounds from direct trauma. Fewer cases have been reported regarding  cardiac FB caused by ingestion from migration of the object to the heart. Signs  and symptoms for cardiac FB may mimic those of cardiac masses. Cardiac FBs often  require surgical intervention to avoid complications.},

  abstract = {Introduction Esophageal perforation in adults is most frequently caused by ingested foreign bodies. They can migrate through the esophageal wall, damaging the nearby organs such as the aorta or the trachea, with fatal outcome. After the diagnosis, the viable treatments for extracting the foreign body and repairing the perforation are several. The appropriate treatment, may be endoscopic, surgical or combined, depending on the level of the perforation, on the co-morbidities of the patient and on the available resources. Presentation of case This paper describes a case of a 68 years old patient with a double EP caused by a meat-bone that perforated the thoracic esophageal wall, approaching the aorta on the left side and the azygos vein on the right side. Discussion Because of the double transfixion and the position near the aorta and the azygos, it was not possible to remove safely the bone during the endoscopy. The management required a combined endoscopic and surgical approach. This way it was possible to detect easily the location of the perforation, to remove safely the foreign body, to repair the perforation both from the outside and from the inside, and to place the nasogastric tube under direct vision. Conclusion Even when the type of esophageal perforation requires surgical treatment, the simultaneous use of endoscopy proved to be an advantage in order to extract the foreign body safely, to perform a double repair of the perforation and to place the nasogastric tube under direct vision.},

METHODS:  Refugee children admitted to pediatric surgery department of a teaching hospital  during the years 2012-2017 were included. Patients' files were reviewed  retrospectively for sociodemographic and medical features. RESULTS: A total of  254 patients with the mean age of 4.6\,{\textpm}\,4.15~years (0-16~years) were treated.  Male-to-female ratio was 1.7. Most common diagnosis were inguino-scrotal  pathologies (n\,=\,50, 19.7\%) followed by foreign body ingestion (n\,=\,37, 14.6\%)  and corrosive esophagitis (n\,=\,22, 8.7\%). The cause of admission was a  potentially preventable trauma in 24.4\% of cases. Comorbid medical conditions  were present in 49 patients (19.3\%). Anemia was detected in 23.2\% of cases.  Weight according to age and gender were\,{$<$}\,3 percentile in 29.1\% of patients.  Difficulties in communication, lack of former medical history and advanced  presentation of disease were the challenges faced by caregivers. CONCLUSION: The  primary diagnoses for admission of refugee children were different from the  routine practice and a significant part were from preventable causes.  Comorbidities were common potentially having a negative influence on treatment  processes. This can be a result of unfavorable living conditions and lack of  medical care during migration.},

In this work, a  case of perforation of the sigmoid colon is described, caused by a toothpick  ingestion. The patient had to be surgically treated because of a complication:  the formation of an entero-iliac fistula with subsequent development of a  pseudoaneurysm of the right external iliac artery. Vascular perforation due to  toothpick ingestion has rarely been reported. In similar cases, it could be  difficult to establishing the correct diagnosis because of the low sensitivity  and accuracy rates of diagnostic investigations. The ingestion of foreign bodies  should be kept in mind as an important differential diagnosis in patients with  acute abdomen or chronic abdominal pain of unknown origin.},

  abstract = {Rationale and aim: The purpose of this study is to acquire a better understanding of Food Foreign Bodies (FFB) injuries in children characterizing the risk of complications and prolonged hospitalization due to food items according to patients' characteristics, circumstances of the accident, Foreign Body (FB) features and FB location, as emerging from the SUSY Safe Web-Registry. Methods: The present study uses data provided by the SUSY Safe Project, a DG SANCO co-funded project started in February 2005, which was aimed at establishing an international registry of cases of Foreign Bodies (FB) injuries in children aged 0-14 years. The analysis was carried out on injuries due to a food item. FB location was reported according to ICD9-CM code: ears (ICD931). nose (ICD932), pharynx and larynx (ICD933) trachea, bronchi and lungs (ICD934), mouth, esophagus and stomach (ICD935). Age and gender injury distributions were assessed. Data regarding adult supervision and activity before injury were also evaluated. FBs which most frequently cause complications were identified. The association between children age, adult presence, object characteristics and hospitalization/complications was computed using unweighted odds ratios and the related 95\% confidence intervals. Results: 16,878 FB injuries occurred in children aged 0-14 years have been recorded in the SUSY Safe databases. FB type was specified in 10,564 cases; among them 2744(26\%) were due to a food item. FB site was recorded in 1344 cases: FB was located in the ears in 99 patients, while 1140 occurred in the upper and lower respiratory tract; finally, 105 food items were removed from mouth, esophagus and stomach. Complications occurred in 176 cases and the most documented was pulmonary or bronchial infections (23\%) followed emphysema or atelectasis and by and asthma (7\%). Bones were the commonest retrieved FFB encountered in this study, while nuts seem to be the FFB most frequently associated to complications. Conclusions: On the basis of this study we make the strong recommendation that parents should be adequately educated and provide age-appropriate food to their children and be present in order to supervise them during eating especially during a critical period ranging from 2 to 3 years of age.

As the incidence of FBs requiring operative removal varies from 1\% to 14\%, it was decided to perform this study and compare the data with those from the world literature, as well as to outline an algorithm for management, including indications for surgery. We reviewed all patients with FB ingestion from 1973 to 1993. There were 542 patients with 1203 ingestions, aged 15 to 82 years. Among them, 69.9\% (n= 379) were jail inmates at the time of ingestion, 22.9\% (n= 124) had a history of psychosis, and 7.2\% (n= 39) were alcoholics or denture-wearing elderly subjects. Most foreign bodies passed spontaneously (75.6\%;n= 410). Endoscopic removal was possible in 19.5\% (n= 106) and was not associated with any morbidity. Only 4.8\% (n= 26) required surgery. Of the latter, 30.8\% (n= 8) had long gastric FBs with no tendency for distal passage and were removed via gastrotomy; 15.4\% (n= 4) had thin, sharp FBs, causing perforation; and 53.8\% (n= 14) had FBs impacted in the ileocecal region, which were removed via appendicostomy. Conservative approach to FB ingestion is justified, although early endoscopic removal from the stomach is recommended. In cases of failure, surgical removal for gastric FBs longer than 7.0 cm is wise. Thin, sharp FBs require a high index of suspicion because they carry a higher risk for perforation. The ileocecal region is the most common site of impaction. Removal of the FB via appendicostomy is the safest option and should not be delayed more than 48 hours.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: This report identifies a group of children in whom severe acute food bolus impaction (AFBI) was the leading symptom of gastroesophageal  reflux (GER) in the absence of stricture. METHODS: The esophageal structure and  function of 8 patients treated for AFBI requiring endoscopic removal of  alimentary foreign bodies in 6 of them (up to 4 times in 1 case) were  investigated by barium meal, esophagoscopy-biopsy, pH-metering, pull-through  stationary manometry, and 24-hour ambulatory manometry. The results were compared  with those in a group of age-matched regular refluxers (n = 14) without AFBI.  RESULTS: Six boys and 2 girls aged 108 +/- 59 months had impaction. Six children  had symptoms of GER like vomiting during infancy, heartburn, or respiratory tract  disease. Barium swallow ruled out stenosis in all patients and showed small  hiatal hernias in 3. All had endoscopic and histologic esophagitis (moderate to  severe in 6), and one had Schatzki ring. All but one (who had 8.45 mm Hg) had  normal lower esophageal sphincter pressure (16.2 +/- 4.7 mm Hg, mean +/- SD), and  all showed normal sphincteric relaxation. Esophageal body motility was not  significantly different from that in regular refluxers except in 6 children in  whom energetic distal peristalsis after reflux episodes could be seen  particularly during the night. Three of them had amazingly powerful distal waves  during the day and even stronger, simultaneous, wide and bizarre-shaped waves  during sleep. Symptoms improved in all cases after antireflux medication. Four  patients were cured after antireflux surgery. CONCLUSIONS: AFBI is a dramatic but  practically unheard of symptom of GER in children. It should be differentiated  from dysphagia and reveals motor dysfunction, sometimes severe, of the esophageal  body in the absence of sphincteric obstruction. Antireflux medication or surgery  were uniformly successful in our patients.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gastric pharmacobezoars are a rare entity that can induce mechanical gastric outlet obstructions and sometimes prolong toxic  pharmacological effects. Certain medications, such as sustained-release forms,  contain cellulose derivatives that may contribute to the adhesion between pills  and lead to the creation of an aggregate resulting in a pharmacobezoar. Case  reports are rare, and official guidelines are needed to help medical teams choose  proper treatment options. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 40-year-old  Caucasian woman with borderline personality disorder and active suicidal thoughts  who was found unconscious after a massive drug consumption of slow-release  clomipramine, lorazepam, and domperidone. On her arrival in the emergency room,  endotracheal intubation was preformed to protect her airway, and a chest x-ray  revealed multiple coffee grain-sized opaque masses in the stomach. She was  treated with activated charcoal followed by two endoscopic gastric  decontaminations 12\,h apart in order to extract a massive gastric pharmacobezoar  by manual removal of the tablets. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates that in the  case of a massive drug consumption, a pharmacobezoar should be suspected,  particularly when cellulose-coated pills are ingested. Severe poisoning due to  delayed drug release from the gastric aggregate is a potential complication.  Detection by x-ray is crucial, and treatment is centered on removal of the  aggregate. The technique of decontamination varies among experts, and no formal  recommendations exist to date. It seems reasonable that endoscopic evaluation  should be performed in order to determine the appropriate technique of  decontamination. Care should be patient-oriented and take into account the  clinical presentation and any organ failure, and it should not be determined  solely by the suspected medication ingested. Thus, serum levels are not  sufficient to guide management of tricyclic antidepressant intoxication.},

Coins that are in the esophagus and are causing  symptoms (cough, stridor, respiratory distress, drooling or pain) are managed  with immediate removal via various methods. Asymptomatic coins have been a  perplexing problem to the clinician for decades, with some advocating for  immediate removal while others are proponents of "watchful waiting". RECENT  FINDINGS: This article will provide a review of the current literature on  management options for symptomatic and asymptomatic esophageal coins. The article  will discuss clinical decision-making strategies for the diagnosis of the  unwitnessed ingestion, as well as diagnostic studies, such as plain radiographs,  as well as novel modalities, such as metal detectors. Discussion of the anatomic  issues related to esophageal foreign bodies will be addressed. Treatment options  for asymptomatic patients will be reviewed utilizing data from retrospective  studies as well as a prospective randomized trial. SUMMARY: In the symptomatic  patient with an esophageal coin, immediate removal via endoscopy is recommended.  For the asymptomatic patient with an esophageal coin, current data support  expectant management for a period of 12-24 h with the hope of spontaneous passage  and avoidance of general anesthesia and surgical procedure.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe the incidence and management of gastrointestinal tract Buckyball magnets ingestions in a multicenter Chinese pediatric patient  population, and discuss the preventive measures. METHODS: Medical records of 74  pediatric patients from 9 large Chinese hospitals during the past 10\,years, who  were diagnosed as buckyball magnets ingestion and got invasive treatment, were  retrospectively studied. The follow-up was through telephone and outpatient  service to estimate the post-surgery condition. Information collection was  through online questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the 74 cases, there were 50 boys  (68\%) and 24 girls (32\%). The median age was 36 (interquartile range (IQR) 22-77)  months, with a range of 7\,months to 11\,years, and it showed two peaks, the first  between 1 and 3\,years, and the second between 6 to 11\,years. The annual case  number showed a sharp increase over time, and the total case number in the last  2\,years (2017 and 2018) showed a greater than 9-fold increase when compared with  the first 2\,years (2013 and 2014). The majority of ingestions were unintentional,  with only 3 patients deliberately swallowing the Buckyball magnets. The median  time of ingestion until the onset of emergent symptoms was 2 (IQR 1-5) days, and  ranged from 4\,h to 40\,days. Twenty-one patients had no symptoms, and the  remaining cases presented with abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, abdominal  distension, excessive crying, melena, and the ceasing of flatus and defecation.  Gastroscopy, colonoscopy, laparoscopic surgery and laparotomy surgery were  performed in accordance with the algorithm from the North American Society of  Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN). Procedural and  operative findings included gastrointestinal mucosa erosion, ischemia and  necrosis, perforation, and abdominal abscess, fistula and intestinal obstruction.  The median number of Buckyball magnets ingested was 4 (IQR 2-8), with a range  from 1 to 39. During the median follow-up period of 6 (IQR 1-15) months, 3  patients had intestinal obstruction, and one underwent a second operation. The  remaining 71 patients courses were uneventful during the follow-up period. None  of the 74 patients reported a second swallowing of foreign bodies. CONCLUSIONS:  The incidence of pediatric gastrointestinal tract magnets ingestion in China is  increasing. Management of such patients should follow the NASPGHAN algorithm.  Preventive measures to limit children's access to Buckyball magnets should be  taken from three levels, namely the national administration, producer, and  consumer.},

However, there may be difficulty locating FBs and complications associated with their removal. This study aimed to identify risk factors and complications correlated to the presence and removal of FBs. Methods This 5-year retrospective study enrolled 1,311 patients between June 2014 and April 2019. Demographic and endoscopic data were collected, containing age, gender, types and location of FBs, duration of FB ingestion, accessory devices, endoscopic methods, and complications. Logistic regression analysis was applied to evaluate the predictive risk factors. Results Among 1,131 patients, FBs were found in 90.16\% of cases. A major predictor for the presence of FB was a presentation of less than 24 hours (h). The types of FBs were jujube pits (36.72\%) and fish bones (22.00\%), and over 80\% of the FBs were discovered in the esophagus. Complications were found in 239 cases (20.22\%), of which hemorrhage (162/239, 67.78\%) was the most frequent. Age {$\geq$}60, duration {$\geq$}24 h, and FBs ingested in the esophagus were considered as risk factors for developing complications. Conclusions In conclusion, the longer duration, age {$\geq$}60, and impaction in the esophagus were risk factors for developing complications following the ingestion of FBs. These factors should be considered when developing assessment and treatment plans in the management of FB ingestion.},

Coins in the esophagus are removed promptly if in the cervical or mid esophagus, and within 12 hours if in the distal esophagus. Once in the stomach, they will usually pass without difficulty. Meat impaction resulting in an obstructed esophagus is an urgent problem and the bolus should be removed within hours. Sharp and pointed foreign bodies can be very difficult to manage. Dry runs with a reproduction of the foreign body are essential to successful removal. Button batteries lodged in the esophagus represent an emergency and should be removed without delay. Once in the stomach, they will usually pass through the gastrointestinal tract without difficulty.

There were 75 separate hospitalizations, all occurring in 22 male prison inmates. A total of 256 foreign bodies were ingested.

Sixty-four endoscopies were performed with removal of 79 of 163 foreign bodies (48\% success rate). Five patients required general anesthesia because of a lack of cooperation. Complications occurred in four of them, one requiring laparotomy. Eight additional laparotomies were performed. One was performed for an acute abdomen on admission and one for the development of an acute abdomen after conservative management. Two were performed to remove metal bezoars. Four additional laparotomies were performed because of surgeon preference. Among the 23 patients admitted and managed conservatively, 77 (97\%) of 79 foreign bodies passed spontaneously. One patient required laparotomy. Of the 256 ingested foreign bodies, 79 were removed endoscopically, 71 were removed surgically, and 106 passed spontaneously. The size, shape, and number were not predictive of the ability to transit the gastrointestinal tract. Foreign body ingestion is problematic in prison inmates. With conservative management, most foreign bodies will pass spontaneously. Endoscopy has a high failure rate and is associated with significant complications.

  abstract = {Abstract - Background Available evidence on the effects of a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO 2 ) of 60\% to 90\% compared with a routine fraction of inspired oxygen of 30\% to 40\%, during anaesthesia and surgery, on mortality and surgical site infection has been inconclusive. Previous trials and meta-analyses have led to different conclusions on whether a high fraction of supplemental inspired oxygen during anaesthesia may decrease or increase mortality and surgical site infections in surgical patients. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of an FIO 2  equal to or greater than 60\% compared with a control FIO 2  at or below 40\% in the perioperative setting in terms of mortality, surgical site infection, respiratory insufficiency, serious adverse events and length of stay during the index admission for adult surgical patients. We looked at various outcomes, conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses, examined the role of bias and applied trial sequential analysis (TSA) to examine the level of evidence supporting or refuting a high FIO 2  during surgery, anaesthesia and recovery. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, International Web of Science, the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), advanced Google and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) up to February 2014. We checked the references of included trials and reviews for unidentified relevant trials and reran the searches in March 2015. We will consider two studies of interest when we update the review. Selection criteria We included randomized clinical trials that compared a high fraction of inspired oxygen with a routine fraction of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia, surgery and recovery in individuals 18 years of age or older. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data independently. We conducted random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses, and for dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs). We used published data and data obtained by contacting trial authors. To minimize the risk of systematic error, we assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. To reduce the risk of random errors caused by sparse data and repetitive updating of cumulative meta-analyses, we applied trial sequential analyses. We used Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results We included 28 randomized clinical trials (9330 participants); in the 21 trials reporting relevant outcomes for this review, 7597 participants were randomly assigned to a high fraction of inspired oxygen versus a routine fraction of inspired oxygen. In trials with an overall low risk of bias, a high fraction of inspired oxygen compared with a routine fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with all-cause mortality (random-effects model: RR 1.12, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.36; GRADE: low quality) within the longest follow-up and within 30 days of follow-up (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.99, 95\% CI 0.61 to 1.60; GRADE: low quality). In a trial sequential analysis, the required information size was not reached and the analysis could not refute a 20\% increase in mortality. Similarly, when all trials were included, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with all{\dbend}{\dbend}{\dbend}cause mortality to the longest follow-up (RR 1.07, 95\% CI 0.87 to 1.33) or within 30 days of follow-up (Peto OR 0.83, 95\% CI 0.54 to 1.29), both of very low quality according to GRADE. Neither was a high fraction of inspired oxygen associated with the risk of surgical site infection in trials with low risk of bias (RR 0.86, 95\% CI 0.63 to 1.17; GRADE: low quality) or in all trials (RR 0.87, 95\% CI 0.71 to 1.07; GRADE: low quality). A high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with respiratory insufficiency (RR 1.25, 95\% CI 0.79 to 1.99), serious adverse events (RR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.65 to 1.43) or length of stay (mean difference -0.06 days, 95\% CI -0.44 to 0.32 days). In subgroup analyses of nine trials using preoperative antibiotics, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was associated with a decrease in surgical site infections (RR 0.76, 95\% CI 0.60 to 0.97; GRADE: very low quality); a similar effect was noted in the five trials adequately blinded for the outcome assessment (RR 0.79, 95\% CI 0.66 to 0.96; GRADE: very low quality). We did not observe an effect of a high fraction of inspired oxygen on surgical site infections in any other subgroup analyses. Authors' conclusions As the risk of adverse events, including mortality, may be increased by a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60\% or higher, and as robust evidence is lacking for a beneficial effect of a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60\% or higher on surgical site infection, our overall results suggest that evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of a high fraction of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia and surgery. Given the risk of attrition and outcome reporting bias, as well as other weaknesses in the available evidence, further randomized clinical trials with low risk of bias in all bias domains, including a large sample size and long-term follow-up, are warranted. Plain language summary The effects of giving adult patients a high inspiratory oxygen fraction around the time of surgery Review question The normal air that we breathe contains 21\% oxygen. This systematic review assesses the beneficial and harmful effects of a percentage of inspired oxygen of 60\% to 90\% compared with a routine percentage of 30\% to 40\% given during anaesthesia, during surgery and in the immediate recovery period on the numbers of deaths and surgical site infections reported in adult surgical patients. Background Reduced lung and circulatory function during surgery can lead to reduced levels of oxygen (hypoxia). Also, oxygen levels are often low in wounds at the end of surgery. This may impair bacterial killing and wound healing. Trials and previous meta-analyses have led to different conclusions as to whether a high percentage of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia may decrease or increase the risk of death or surgical site infections. This systematic review used improved Cochrane methodology for carrying out systematic reviews to reassess available evidence derived from randomized clinical trials. Study characteristics We identified 28 randomized clinical trials. Eight trials with 4918 participants reported on risk of death, and 15 trials with 7219 participants reported on surgical site infections within 14 to 30 days of surgery. Four trials reported serious adverse events, three trials respiratory insufficiency, nine trials length of stay during the associated hospital admission and one trial quality of life. All trials were conducted without direct industry funding. The number of participants in each trial ranged from 38 to 2012. The mean age of participants was 50 years (range 15 to 92 years) and 63\% were women. Types of surgery included abdominal surgery (eight trials), caesarean section (four trials), breast surgery (one trial), orthopaedic surgery (two trials) and various other surgical procedures (four trials). Key results A high percentage of inspired oxygen was not statistically associated with increased risk of death, or with a decrease in surgical site infections, in all trials that measured these outcomes, in trials of highest quality and in those with longest follow-up. An increased risk of adverse events could not be proved right or wrong for a high percentage of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia and surgery. Quality and quantity of the evidence Only five of the included trials had low risk of bias. The trials randomly assigned 9330 participants, of whom only 7537 participants provided data for this review. The number of participants required to detect or reject a 20\% relative risk reduction in deaths was not reached; therefore the observed results were uncertain.},

This study aims to evaluate a management protocol where endoscopic examination  was only selectively used after routine direct laryngoscopy to minimize patient  discomfort and the need for general anesthesia in children. METHOD: A management  protocol for foreign body ingestion based on symptoms was introduced in 1998 and  records of children admitted to a university-affiliated hospital between January  1999 and October 2005 with suspected foreign body ingestion were evaluated.  Symptoms, radiologic and endoscopic findings, and outcome were reviewed. RESULTS:  A total of 282 patients were admitted. The mean age of patients was 5.75 years  (range, 9 months to 17 years). There were 167 boys and 115 girls. Based on our  protocol, 84 (29.8\%) patients required an upper endoscopy. Fish bones were most  commonly involved (68.8\%). Foreign bodies, which were either removed or  dislodged, were found during upper endoscopy in only 25 (8.8\%) patients overall.  All patients had an uneventful outcome. No complications or mortalities were  encountered. There were no readmissions for those who did not undergo endoscopic  examination. CONCLUSION: It is safe to selectively perform upper endoscopy  depending on symptoms when managing children with foreign body ingestion.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Intentional foreign body ingestion represents a challenge to treat for emergency room physicians, endoscopists, and psychiatrists alike. Time from ingestion and composition of the ingested object are often unclear on initial presentation, making it difficult for endoscopists to determine the optimal timing for attempting procedural removal. Fortunately, over 80 percent of these ingested foreign bodies pass without the need for endoscopic intervention. We present a case, however, where emergent collaborative endoscopic intervention was needed. Case Description/Methods: A 29-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder presented following purposeful ingestion of a foreign body. The patient was in a cemetery when he experienced auditory hallucinations instructing him to swallow his crucifix necklace. Following ingestion, the patient immediately experienced drooling, coughing, and dysphagia. Despite his attempts to selfexpel the crucifix, it remained lodged. On arrival to the emergency department, the patient was intubated for airway protection. Initial laboratory findings were unremarkable except for a urine drug screen that was positive for amphetamines. Initially, the gastroenterology team was consulted, and EGD was pursued. An Olympus endoscope was inserted into the mouth and advanced under direct visualization to the upper esophageal sphincter where a metallic tip was seen. Rat tooth forceps were used to attempt to grasp the metallic object but resistance was met, and the procedure was aborted. Otolaryngology was then consulted and performed a direct laryngoscopy using a Lindholm laryngoscope. Evaluation showed that the distal aspect of the cross was down into the cervical esophagus while the right aspect of the cross was in the patient's hypopharynx. The otolaryngology team was able to use a grasper to grab the clasp of the cross with successful removal. Following the procedure, the patient was safely extubated and eventually was eventually transferred to an inpatient psychiatric hospital. Discussion: This case highlights the importance of a multi-specialty approach to purposeful foreign body ingestion. Flexible endoscopy has become the instrument of choice in managing foreign bodies and, with the advent of retrieval devices, it has led to more than a 90 percent success rate of retrieval. Our case highlights that even when unsuccessful the importance of working alongside our otolaryngology colleagues can ensure safe outcomes.},

However, some patients with esophageal foreign body ingestion do not come to the hospital immediately and may delay medical intervention from the time of ingestion. The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of adults with suspected esophageal foreign body ingestion according to the time of ingestion and types of foreign bodies. A total of 326 adult patients (151 men and 175 women) were analyzed, and divided into two groups according to the time period: within or beyond 24 hours from ingestion to endoscopic intervention. A total of 172 patients (52.7\%) were found to have ingested foreign bodies; 73.5\% were removed smoothly, 10.3\% were treated by push technique and 16.0\% with failed retrieval received alternative treatments. A higher proportion of patients in the beyond-24 hours group suffered from odynophagia (25.9 vs. 12.9\%, P {$<$} 0.05). Negative identification of esophageal foreign bodies was more frequent in the beyond-24 hours group (67 vs. 40.2\%, P {$<$} 0.05), but these patients showed higher proportions of esophageal ulcers (21.1 vs. 7.2\%, P {$<$} 0.05). The beyond-24 hours group also showed a significantly higher rate of foreign bodies in the lower esophagus (40.0 vs. 15.3\%, P {$<$} 0.05). Patients with esophageal food bolus impaction had significant delayed endoscopic intervention, longer therapeutic endoscopic time, higher proportions of esophageal cancer, stricture and fewer complications. Endoscopic intervention within 24 hours from the time of ingestion should be considered early in adults, because delaying intervention may produce more symptomatic esophageal ulcerations with odynophagia.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Determining whether prompt surgery is required for patient with ingested foreign bodies is clinically important. PURPOSE: To evaluate the  potential value of computed tomography (CT) in guiding the selection of surgical  treatment for patients with ingested foreign bodies in the lower gastrointestinal  tract. METHODS: Between January 2014 and December 2023, we analyzed the data of  58 patients (median age: 65.4~years; range, 31-96~years) with ingested foreign  bodies in the lower gastrointestinal tract who underwent CT examinations.  Patients were treated either conservatively (35 cases) or surgically (23 cases).  The angle between the long axis of the foreign body and the intestinal canal  (FB-IC angle) was measured. CT findings and clinical variables were evaluated to  identify potential indicators for surgical treatment through univariate and  multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed  the FB-IC angle (P\,=\,0.002), presence of free peritoneal gas (P\,=\,0.002), white  blood cell count (P\,=\,0.018), and neutrophil count (P\,=\,0.007) as significant  factors associated with surgical treatment. Multivariate analysis demonstrated  that the FB-IC angle (odds ratio, 1.033; P\,=\,0.045) and the presence of free  peritoneal gas (odds ratio, 41.335; P\,=\,0.002) are independent indicators for  surgical management. The FB-IC angle showed an area under the receiver operating  characteristic curve of 0.755, with a cutoff value of 51.25 degrees. CONCLUSION:  The FB-IC angle and presence of free peritoneal gas serve as potential predictive  imaging markers for surgical intervention.},

Patients and Methods: We report the case of a 67-year-old man with diffuse swelling of the cheek and the discharge of pus from the parotid duct orifice caused by a fish bone that had penetrated into the parotid duct. The preoperative examination using ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a linear foreign body. Results: The fish bone was thought to be embedded deeply in the parotid duct; therefore, we used a combined approach (endoscopy with open surgery), because we anticipated difficulties with endoscopic removal of the fish bone. The endoscopic view showed that the fish bone had partially penetrated the soft tissue in the parotid duct wall, but the fish bone could not be removed endoscopically. With endoscopic assistance, the impacted fish bone was removed using an intraoral surgical approach. The clinical outcome was satisfactory during a 10-month follow-up period, with no evidence of complications. Conclusions: The combined surgical and endoscopic approach resulted in the safe and effective removal of a foreign body from the salivary duct that could not be removed using sialendoscopy alone.

Abdominal pain is the most common presenting symptom. We present a case of an ingested pen causing duodenal perforation and hepatic abscess several months after initially presenting with a pericardial effusion. Case presentation A 59-year-old female living in an intensive tertiary mental health facility was noted to have an incidental pericardial effusion during work-up for hyponatremia. Seven months later, she developed a new fever and was noted to have interval increase in the pericardial effusion size. This prompted further investigation which finally revealed that an ingested pen had perforated through the first part of the duodenum and caused an abscess in the left lobe of the liver. The pericardial effusion was presumed secondary to local inflammation. Upon discovery of the abscess, the patient underwent successful operative management including abscess drainage, foreign body extraction, and duodenal repair. Clinical discussion Reports of hepatic abscess from foreign body causing duodenal perforation are rare, with bone fragments and toothpicks the most common foreign bodies implicated. There is one other previously reported case of an ingested pen. Abdominal pain is present in up to 85\% of cases, but fever may be the only presenting symptom. Conclusion Foreign body migration causing a hepatic abscess may present non-specifically with unexplained fever or even pericardial effusion. Psychiatric comorbidities may contribute to delays in diagnosis due to difficulties recalling the episode of ingestion.},

Search methods To find new studies for this updated review, in January 2014 we searched, according to the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases model, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library ), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL; and major conference proceedings (up to January 2014).   Selection criteria Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in which patients with inoperable or unresectable primary oesophageal cancer underwent palliative treatment. Different interventions like rigid plastic intubation, self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) insertion, brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy, chemotherapy, oesophageal bypass surgery, chemical and thermal ablation therapy, either head-to-head or in combination, were included. The primary outcome was dysphagia improvement. Secondary outcomes included recurrent dysphagia, technical success, procedure related mortality, 30-day mortality, adverse effects and quality of life. Data collection and analysis Data collection and analysis were performed in accordance with the methods of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Review Group. Main results We included 3684 patients from 53 studies. SEMS insertion was safer and more effective than plastic tube insertion. Thermal and chemical ablative therapy provided comparable dysphagia palliation but had an increased requirement for re-interventions and for adverse effects. Anti-reflux stents provided comparable dysphagia palliation to conventional metal stents. Some anti-reflux stents might have reduced gastro-oesophageal reflux and complications. Newly-designed double-layered nitinol (Niti-S) stents were preferable due to longer survival time and fewer complications compared to simple Niti-S stents. Brachytherapy might be a suitable alternative to SEMS in providing a survival advantage and possibly a better quality of life, and might provide better results when combined with argon plasma coagulation or external beam radiation therapy. Authors' conclusions Self-expanding metal stent insertion is safe, effective and quicker in palliating dysphagia compared to other modalities. However, high-dose intraluminal brachytherapy is a suitable alternative and might provide additional survival benefit with a better quality of life. Some anti-reflux stents and newly-designed stents lead to longer survival and fewer complications compared to conventional stents. Combinations of brachytherapy with self-expanding metal stent insertion or radiotherapy are preferable due to the reduced requirement for re-interventions. Rigid plastic tube insertion, dilatation alone or in combination with other modalities, and chemotherapy alone are not recommended for palliation of dysphagia due to a high incidence of delayed complications and recurrent dysphagia. Plain language summary Interventions for reducing difficulty in swallowing in people with oesophageal cancer Review question For most patients with unresectable or inoperable oesophageal cancer, providing clinical benefit with palliative treatment is highly desirable. However, the optimal palliative technique for dysphagia improvement and better quality of life is not established. Background Dysphagia (difficulty or discomfort in swallowing) is common among patients with unresectable or inoperable oesophageal cancer. There are five levels of dysphagia, ranging from the ability to eat a normal diet to some solids, semisolids, liquids and to complete dysphagia. Study characteristics The review included randomised controlled studies comparing the use of different interventions to improve dysphagia among patients with inoperable or unresectable primary oesophageal cancer. To find new studies for this updated review, in January 2014 we searched, according to the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases model, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library ), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL; and major conference proceedings (up to January 2014). Key results The review updates the previous version but still fails to present any obvious superiority of one technique over another among the different kinds of interventions. Self-expanding metal stents provided safer and more effective relief of dysphagia compared to rigid plastic stents. Other techniques like radiotherapy or brachytherapy were also suitable alternatives and might be favourable in improving quality of life and prolonging survival. Individual differences should be emphasised when the intervention type was determined. Quality of the evidence Half of the studies included in this review were of high quality. Most studies did not state the methods used to seek and report quality of life outcomes and adverse effects.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To manage the acquired benign complicated tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) and bronchial-gastric stump fistula (BGSF) are clinical technical  challenge. The purpose of this study is to retrospectively review a surgical  "double patch" technique in treating nonmalignant complicated TEF and BGSF, and  then clarify the long-term curative effect of the technique. METHODS: Clinical  records of 30 patients with non-malignant complicated TEF and BGSF treated by  "double patch" technique in Tangdu Hospital between August 2004 and August 2014,  were analyzed and summarized retrospectively. RESULTS: Thirty patients (19 males  and 11 females) underwent "double patch" surgical repair of acquired benign  complicated TEF and BGSF. The median age of the patients was 40.2{\textpm}21.1 years. The  most common causes were the following: TEF [22], BGSF [8]. Post-intubation injury  [6], trauma [5], foreign body and stents [10], complications from prior  esophageal surgery [8], and caustic ingestion [1]. The follow-up was completed  for 24 months in all the patients (100\%). The operative mortality was 0\% (0/30).  Twenty-six patients (86.7\%) recovered uneventfully while four patients (13.3\%)  exhibited some major complications in the perioperative and postoperative  periods. One patient (3.3\%) developed recurrence of tracheal fistula in situ, two  patients (6.7\%) showed pneumonia, and one patient (3.3\%) developed fistula  esophageal anastomosis. All the 30 patients resumed oral intake finally.  CONCLUSIONS: The double patch technique is an effective and safe method to repair  the acquired non-malignant complicated TEF and BGSF.},

In general, perforation  of the esophagus often results in periesophagitis and even fatal abscesses. The  presence of a giant foreign body in the neck without obvious symptoms or  complications for many years is rare. CASE SUMMARY: We present the case of a  32-year-old man who intentionally swallowed a thermometer which was unable to be  located by endoscopy at his initial visit. He had no remarkable symptoms for 5  years other than paresthesia and limited movement of the left neck until 7 d  before this admission. The foreign body was removed successfully by the surgery.  CONCLUSION: The presence of a giant foreign body in the neck without obvious  symptoms or complications for many years is rare. Both endoscopic and  radiological examinations are essential for the diagnosis of alimentary foreign  bodies.},

METHODS: We review our experience to compare surgical and nonsurgical  approaches for treating symptomatic body-packing patients. RESULTS: From April  2004 to March 2007, 45 patients were referred to our hospital. Nine of them  underwent surgical intervention. The number of packets and total swallowed drugs  were more among surgically-treated patients (P = 0.003, 0.004 respectively). The  mean duration between drug swallowing and admission to the hospital was longer  among surgically-treated patients (P = 0.001). Surgically-treated patients were  more symptomatic. Resistant toxicity and symptomatic cocaine and heroin mixture  packing were the most common indications for surgery. Surgery was usually  performed without any complication. CONCLUSION: Surgical intervention is  indicated for body packers with persistent nonresponsive toxicity,  gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation, and symptomatic cocaine packers.},

  abstract = {Introduction. Unintentional foreign body ingestion commonly occurs accidentally in children aged between 3 months and 6 years and at advanced ages or results  from psychiatric disorders such as hallucination in patients with mental  retardation. Most of the ingested foreign bodies are naturally discharged from  the body but some of them may require surgical intervention. Presentation of  Case. A 29-year-old mentally retarded female patient was admitted to the  emergency service with a two-day history of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness, defense, and rebound on  palpation. Radiological examination revealed diffuse air-fluid levels and a  radiopaque impression of a metal object in the right upper quadrant. The metal  teaspoon causing ileal perforation was extracted by emergency laparotomy. On  postoperative day 7, the patient was uneventfully discharged following a  psychiatric consultation. Discussion. Foreign body ingestion can occur  intentionally in children at developing ages and old-age patients, or adults and  prisoners, whereas it may occur unintentionally in patients with mental  retardation due to hallucination. However, repeated foreign body ingestion is  very rare in individuals other than mentally retarded patients. Conclusion.  Mentally retarded patients should be kept under close surveillance by surgeons  and psychiatrists due to their tendency to ingest foreign bodies.},

The aim of the present study was to report the experience of management of upper gastrointestinal foreign bodies by endoscopy in a large center. All patients who presented at the Department of Gastroenterology at Nanfang Hospital (Guangzhou, China) with complaints regarding upper gastrointestinal (GI) foreign body ingestion from December 1987 to December 2013. Hospital medical charts and endoscopic records were examined to evaluate etiology, treatment, and outcomes for these patients. A total of 846 patients were enrolled in the present study, from which foreign bodies were detected in 737 (87.1\%) patients via X-ray or endoscopy. The objects most frequently ingested were bones (n=395, 53.6\%). The detected foreign bodies were predominantly located in the cervical esophagus (n=325, 44.1\%). Endoscopic foreign body extraction was successful in 92.5\% of cases, whereas surgery was required in 6 patients. The most frequently used endoscopic accessory devices were retrieval forceps (n=480, 65.1\%). The complication rate was 6.9\%, including mucosal laceration (n=10) and others, all of which were managed conservatively. Associated GI diseases were reported in 74 (10.0\%) patients, including postesophagectomy (n=34) and others. In conclusion, the endoscopic procedure was safe and effective for the removal of foreign bodies from the upper gastrointestinal tract, with a high success rate and low complication rate.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Sharp-pointed FBs with both sides embedded in the duodenal wall are rare. Compared with smooth edged FBs, sharp objects are more likely to be associated with significant adverse events, when penetrating the wall of the digestive tract. The clinical features of patients who experienced sharp-pointed FBs embedded in both sides of the duodenum were retrospectively analyzed, as were the efficacy and safety of endoscopic removal of these FBs. Patients and Methods: This retrospective study included 21 adults with both sides of sharp-pointed FBs embedded into the duodenal wall who were admitted to the Second Xiangya Hospital in China between January 1, 1996, and May 31, 2021. Data associated with the endoscopic removal of these FBs were collected from the electronic medical record system (EMRS) of the hospital. Results: The incidence rate of duodenal total FBs and FBs embedded in both sides was 8.87\% and 1.03\%, respectively. The success rate of endoscopic treatment was 100.00\% in 124 patients without embedded duodenal FBs and 97.14\% in 35 patients with one side embedded duodenal FBs. Of the 21 patients with FBs embedded in both sides of the duodenal wall, endoscopic removal was successful in 85.71\% of patients, whereas 14.29\% required surgery. FBs removed from these patients included toothpicks in 12; needles in 3; jujube pits in 2; and a chopstick, dentures, fish bones, and chicken bones in one each. Most of these 21 FBs were located in the bulb and descending duodenum, followed by the third part of duodenum. Conclusion: Sharp-edged FBs with both sides embedded in the duodenal wall are rare. Endoscopic removal may be considered as a feasible, safe, and effective method of removing sharp-pointed FBs with both sides embedded in the duodenal wall. And if endoscopic removal is unsuccessful, surgical management can be a secondary option.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: The frequency of medical emergencies in a dental setting is relatively low. However, most dental treatment occurs outside of a hospital  setting; thus the time to respond to a life-threatening situation is crucial. The  aim of this study was to determine the frequency and characteristics of medical  emergencies that occurred at the Griffith University Dental Clinic over a 6-year  period. METHODS: Data involving medical emergencies was collected at a dental  school between January 2014 and December 2019. Data was obtained from the risk  incident reporting system (GSafe), and descriptive statistics were analyzed using  IBM SPSS. RESULTS: The frequency of medical emergencies in a dental setting over  the 6-year retrospective period based on the number of dental services provided  was 0.037\% (n~=~108). The three most common medical emergencies were syncope  (25.0\%), hypoglycemia (16.7\%), and foreign body ingestion (13.9\%). These happened  more often during dental extractions (26.9\%), followed by local anesthesia  (16.7\%) and restorative procedures (13.0\%). A larger portion of these incidents  occurred during dental treatment (62.0\%) as opposed to before (12.0\%) or after  (26.0\%). Most medical emergencies happened within the dental student clinic  (72.2\%) followed by the dental waiting room (19.5\%) and dental private clinic  (8.3\%). CONCLUSION: Overall, the number of medical emergencies at the Griffith  University Dental Clinic was low. The most common medical emergencies were  syncope, hypoglycemia, and foreign body ingestion. Dental education in  preventative strategies and training in basic life support is necessary to ensure  dental practitioners can manage the acute deterioration of a patient promptly.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND~           Gastrointestinal foreign body (GFB) ingestion is a common problem and often results in surgical consultation. Current literature is limited to case reports and fails to provide data regarding the management of sharp GFB ingestion. We hypothesized that patients who ingest sharp objects rarely have perforation or obstruction requiring surgical intervention.           METHODS~           Patients presenting with GFBs from January 2005 to December 2015 at a level 1 trauma center with an acute care surgery program were retrospectively reviewed. Exclusion criteria were leaving without being seen, noningested GFB, unknown or blunt GFB, or if the GFB was not found on imaging. Data collected included patient demographics, length of stay, imaging, and interventions that were performed.           RESULTS~           During the study period, there were 1,164 patients with 1,245 hospital visits for GFBs; 995 visits were excluded, resulting in 169 sharp GFB ingestion patients with 192 visits included in our study. The average age was 31. Sixty-five percent were men, and 41\% were incarcerated. The average length of stay was 3 days, which was longer in patients with psychiatric holds and consultations. Of the 169 patients, 116 (69\%) had no intervention and did not return for complications. Fifty-five endoscopies were performed with GFB removal in 30 cases. Seven patients (4\%) underwent surgery, five of which had peritonitis. When evaluating the total study cohort, 134 (79\%) of the patients had no procedure or a negative procedure. Patients requiring surgery had significantly larger objects (6 {\textpm} 3 cm) than those who had endoscopy (3 {\textpm} 2 cm) or no procedure (2 {\textpm} 1 cm).           CONCLUSION~           Surgical intervention occurred in only seven (4\%) patients with sharp GFB ingestions, and 79\% of the patients required no intervention. Barring an acute abdomen or esophageal sharp GFBs, patients can be discharged with return precautions, admitted for necessary psychiatric care, or returned to custody for patients seeking secondary gain. Upper gastrointestinal larger GFBs should be removed endoscopically when possible.           LEVEL OF EVIDENCE~           Therapeutic/care management study, level V.},

  abstract = {Objective The assessment of subjective swallowing complaints constitutes an important element in a multidimensional, modern management of head and neck cancer patients suffering from dysphagia. For this purpose, an internationally recognized and validated 10-item questionnaire EAT-10 is used that was developed and validated by Belafski et al. in 2008. The purpose of the present study is the translation of EAT-10 into the German language and its validation for head and neck cancer patients. Material and Methods After the translation of EAT-10 into German according to the guidelines for the translation of foreign measuring instruments, a validation of gEAT-10 was carried out on the basis of the sample of 210 head and neck cancer patients. The reliability was determined by means of the internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha) and item-total correlations (Spearman). The construct validity was verified by the uni-and multivariate analyses of the distribution of gEAT-10 total scores depending on gender, age, BMI, tumor stage and localization as well as type of the oncological therapy. Results The internal consistency amounted to alpha = .94, the item-total correlations varied between rho =. 59 and rho = .85. No significant associations between gEAT-10 total scores and gender as well as age were identified in univariate calculations.Such associations were found for BMI, tumor stage and localization as well as type of the oncological therapy. However, only the tumor stage yielded a significant result in a regression. Conclusions The gEAT-10 was shown to be a reliable and construct valid questionnaire for the assessment of subjective swallowing complaints in patients with head and neck cancer.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Ingestion of a foreign body can cause different degrees of damage to esophagus, and several complications are potentially life-threatening if not  properly handled. The aortic injury caused by a perforating esophageal foreign  body is rare but lethal. The optimal management still remains controversial. The  purpose of this report is to describe our experience in the management of the  aortic injury caused by esophageal foreign body ingestion. METHODS: Between  January 2015 and December 2015, we retrospectively enrolled cases of esophageal  perforation involving the aorta by foreign body. The general parameters,  esophageal foreign body, types of aortic injury, treatment, and outcome were  analyzed. Additionally, we reviewed the literature of the management of  esophageal perforation involving the aorta caused by foreign bodies. The study  was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, College of  Medicine, Zhejiang University, and the need for informed consent was waived  (Quick review 2019, No. 609). RESULTS: Three cases of esophageal perforation  involving the aorta by foreign body was selected in the study. Two male and 1  female patients (range, 51-58 years old) with the aorta involvement caused by a  perforating foreign body in the esophagus in 3 forms were identified, including 1  patient with mycotic aortic pseudoaneurysm, 1 patient with aortoesophageal  fistula and 1 patient with the aortic intramural hematoma. One patient died of  the rupture of the pseudoaneurysm during the preparation of the surgery. The  other 2 patients were cured with a multidisciplinary approach, which is an urgent  thoracic endovascular aortic repair followed by mediastinal debridement/drainage  or endoscopic retrieval. Two of 3 patients were survived until now. CONCLUSION:  The management of the aortic injury caused by esophageal foreign body injury is  challenging. Early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management is crucial.},

  abstract = {Background: Perforation is the most serious complication of esophageal foreign bodies. Studies examining the association between diabetes and esophageal foreign body-induced perforation are largely non-existent. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify the risk factors for esophageal foreign body-induced perforation. Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients with esophageal foreign bodies between January 2012-January 2017 was performed at the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital. The patients were divided into two groups: those complicated with perforation and those without perforation. Date on patient demographics, symptoms, foreign bodies, and diabetes were collected and analyzed. Study-specific odds ratio and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression models. Results: Of 294 patients with esophageal foreign bodies (41.84\% male, mean age, 56.73 years), 33 (11.22\%) complicated by perforation. Diabetes (odds ratio = 6.00; 95\% confidence interval = 1.72-20.23), duration ({$>$} 24 h) of foreign bodies retention (odds ratio = 4.25; 95\% confidence interval = 1.71-10.86), and preoperative fever (odds ratio = 8.19; 95\% confidence interval = 3.17-21.74) were strongly associated with an increased risk of perforation, whereas the sensation of a foreign body (odds ratio = 0.32; 95\% confidence interval = 0.09-0.92) was a protective factor of perforation. Glucose level was not observed to have an association among patients with or without perforation. Conclusions: Diabetes and duration of foreign body retention increase risk for esophageal foreign bodies complicated by perforation, and cases with elevated armpit temperature may represented a more likely perforation compared with those without fever.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Vocal cord paralysis has been reported as a common complication of button battery (BB) ingestion, and there is a need to confirm the mechanism of  vocal cord paralysis for the development of a standardized treatment. METHODS: A  new CR2032 BB and artificial saliva were placed in a fresh pig esophagus with the  recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN); the negative electrode faced the nerve in the  experimental group, while the positive electrode faced the nerve in the control  group. The pH values of the intra- and extraesophageal walls were measured  simultaneously. Pathological examination was performed after the esophagus and  nerves were damaged. RESULTS: After BB ingestion, the pH near the intraesophageal  negative electrode increased rapidly, reaching 11.5~at 30~min and over 14~at 6~h,  while the extraesophageal pH did not change at 1~h and began to accelerate after  2~h, reaching 10~at 6~h. After 6~h of exposure, the pathological section showed  that the structure of the mucosa, submucosa, and muscle layer were destroyed;  chromatin in the nucleus faded, and part of the nerve bundle in the adventitia  had liquefaction necrosis. CONCLUSION: The basic mechanism of vocal cord  paralysis caused by BB ingestion is that the OH(-) generated by the electrolytic  reaction of the negative electrode penetrates the esophageal wall and corrodes  the RLN, which may be the cause of vocal cord paralysis caused by BB ingestion  without esophageal perforation.},

Patients got higher percentage of erosion complication on holidays than that on weekdays (60.8\% vs 47.6\%, P{$<$}.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that jujube shell was a significant predictor of complication on weekdays (P{$<$}.001). However, complication was significantly associated with nonfood bolus FB ingestion on holidays (P{$<$}.001). Our data suggest that there were different clinicopathological characteristics of FB ingestion between weekdays and holidays, and more patients got complications on holidays.

  abstract = {Background: There is paucity of data regarding the prevalence and methods of deliberate self-harm (DSH) in patients with heroin dependence in international literature. In China, there have been a few studies investigating the prevalence of DSH in heroin-dependent patients (HDPs), but their rates varied widely. We thus conducted a meta-analysis of studies assessing the prevalence of DSH among Chinese HDPs. Methods: Relevant studies were retrieved from major Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang data, and SinoMed) and western databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycInfo). Two authors independently identified eligible studies and extracted data. Studies that included a representative sample of Chinese HDPs and ascertained DSH caseness in a reliable way were considered as high quality. Statistical analysis was performed using R software. Results: In total, 15 eligible studies with a total of 37,243 Chinese HDPs were included. All included studies were conducted in heroin detoxification settings. Only two studies were rated as high quality. The pooled prevalence of DSH in Chinese HDPs was 4.4\% (95\%CI: 2.9, 6.2\%), but the heterogeneity of prevalence rates across studies was significant (I2 = 98\%, P {$<$} 0.001). Studies rated as high quality had significantly higher prevalence of DSH than those rated as low quality (13.2 vs. 3.4\%, P {$<$} 0.001). Swallowing foreign objects was the most common method of DSH, with a combined prevalence of 2.7\% (95\%CI: 1.6, 4.4\%). Extreme DSH methods such as cutting offfingers and jumping from height were also not uncommon in this patient population. Conclusion: Due to methodological problems in available studies, we find a relatively low prevalence of DSH among Chinese HDPs receiving detoxification treatment. Nevertheless, the self-harmers of Chinese HDPs are more likely to harm themselves in a dangerous or life-threatening way. Restricting the availability of DSH methods may be an effective way to prevent or reduce DSH in China's detoxification treatment settings. {\copyright} 2018 Zhong, Xu, Xie, Chen and Lu.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUNDS: Previous reports of foreign-body ingestion focused primarily on accidental ingestion and very few studies focused on intentional ingestion of  foreign body (FB) in China. Our study aimed to compare the prevalence of  different age, gender, types, locations and management of FB ingested between  intentional ingestion and accidental ingestion of FB in Northern China. METHODS:  A retrospective case series studied all patients with suspected FB ingestion in  Digestive Endoscopy Center of Beijing Friendship Hospital, between January 2011  and January 2019. The patients were divided into 2 groups. Group A included the  patients who intentionally ingested FBs, and Group B included the patients who  accidentally ingested FBs. Patients' database (demographics, past medical  history, characteristics of FB, endoscopic findings and treatments) were  reviewed. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software. RESULTS: Group  A consisted of 77 prisoners, 2 suspects and 11 psychologically disabled persons.  Group B consisted of 1020 patients with no prisoners, suspects or psychologically  disabled persons. In Group A, there were no food-related foreign bodies, and the  majority of FBs were metallic objects (54.44\%). However in Group B, food-related  FBs were the most common (91.37\%). In Group A, 58 cases (64.44\%) were located in  the stomach, while in Group B, 893 cases (87.55\%) were located in the esophagus  (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). 1096 patients successfully underwent endoscopic removal and 14  failed, including 9 cases in Group A and 5 cases in Group B. The duration of FBs  impaction was longer in Group A than that in Group B (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In  our study, the patients who intentionally ingested FB were mainly prisoners, FBs  were mostly sharp metallic objects, the duration of FBs impaction was longer, and  the rate of successful endoscopic treatment was lower than that of the general  population. Attention should be focused on these patients.},
