For This Purpose, 2 Original Screwdrivers (Straumann And Bego) And A Universal Screwdriver Kit (Bredent) Were Investigated. On 1 Implant Per Screwdriver, 26 Abutments Were Properly Attached One After The Other With The Corresponding Abutment Screws. After Tightening The Abutment Screw, The Force Required To Pull The Screwdriver Off The Screw Head Was Determined With A Spring Balance. For Both Manufacturers, Greater Pull-Off Forces Were Measured When Using The Original Screwdrivers Than When Using The Universal Screwdriver. The Pull-Off Force (Mean +/- Sd) Required For The Straumann Original Screwdriver Was 3.7 +/- 1.4 N, While That Required For The Universal Screwdriver Was 0.1 +/- 0.1 N (P < .001). The Pull-Off Force Was 1.5 +/- 1.5 N For The Bego Original Screwdriver And 0.7 +/- 0.9 N For The Universal Screwdriver (P = .19). Using Original Manufacturer-Supplied Screwdrivers Could Thus Minimize The Risk Of The Screwdriver Slipping Out Of The Screw Head During Dental Treatment And Being Swallowed Or Aspirated By The Patient.",,True,2.0,True,2.0

in children, whereas the majority of adults will have neu-
rological dysfunction, trauma, alcohol abuse, or psycho-
logical disorders. 1 Much has been written about psychiat-
ric patients engaging in self-mutilation such as cutting and
burning, but little is recorded about deliberate aspiration of
objects in these patients, who clinically can be separated
into 4 groups: (1) malingering, (2) psychosis, (3) pica, and (4)
personality disorders. The immediate psychological gain for
these patients is unclear, as the act is insidious with no evi-
dence of intentional harm or immediate danger. Thus, they
are considered as being parasuicidal events designed to
diminish other psychological processes. 2 Aspirated objects
that are not immediately dislodged by coughing, chok-
ing, or gagging require surgical intervention. Most of these
patients usually come to the attention of a psychiatrist, but
such intervention does not prevent recurrences. We discuss
a schizophrenic patient who aspirated multiple coins while
under psychiatric treatment for prior episodes of aspiration
of coins, ingestion of objects, and insertion of others in his
urethra and rectum, while also reviewing some of the diag-
nostic and therapeutic challenges inherent in the manage-
ment of these patients.",False,,False,

This Study Was Undertaken In Order To Better Define  Clinical Patterns Of Iifo Among Prisoners. We Sought To Determine Factors  Associated With The Need For Endoscopic And Surgical Therapy For Iifo. Methods:  After Obtaining Permission To Conduct Iifo Research In Incarcerated Populations,  Study Patients Were Identified By Icd-9 Codes. Patient Charts Were Reviewed For  Demographics; Past Medical History; Iifo Characteristics; And Diagnostic,  Endoscopic, And Surgical Findings. Univariate And Multivariate Analyses Were  Performed Using Statistical Software. Results: Thirty Patients With 141 Episodes  Of Iifo Were Identified. The Mean Number Of Ingested Items Per Episode Was 4.60.  Endoscopy Was Performed In 97 Of 141 Iifo Instances, With Failure To Retrieve The  Ingested Object In 21 Of 97 Cases (22%). Eleven Instances (7.8%) Required  Surgical Intervention.

In China, There Have Been A Few Studies Investigating The Prevalence Of Dsh In Heroin-Dependent Patients (Hdps), But Their Rates Varied Widely. We Thus Conducted A Meta-Analysis Of Studies Assessing The Prevalence Of Dsh Among Chinese Hdps. Methods: Relevant Studies Were Retrieved From Major Chinese Databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, And Sinomed) And Western Databases (Pubmed, Embase, And Psycinfo). Two Authors Independently Identified Eligible Studies And Extracted Data. Studies That Included A Representative Sample Of Chinese Hdps And Ascertained Dsh Caseness In A Reliable Way Were Considered As High Quality. Statistical Analysis Was Performed Using R Software. Results: In Total, 15 Eligible Studies With A Total Of 37,243 Chinese Hdps Were Included. All Included Studies Were Conducted In Heroin Detoxification Settings. Only Two Studies Were Rated As High Quality. The Pooled Prevalence Of Dsh In Chinese Hdps Was 4.4% (95%Ci: 2.9, 6.2%), But The Heterogeneity Of Prevalence Rates Across Studies Was Significant (I2 = 98%, P < 0.001). Studies Rated As High Quality Had Significantly Higher Prevalence Of Dsh Than Those Rated As Low Quality (13.2 Vs. 3.4%, P < 0.001). Swallowing Foreign Objects Was The Most Common Method Of Dsh, With A Combined Prevalence Of 2.7% (95%Ci: 1.6, 4.4%). Extreme Dsh Methods Such As Cutting Offfingers And Jumping From Height Were Also Not Uncommon In This Patient Population. Conclusion: Due To Methodological Problems In Available Studies, We Find A Relatively Low Prevalence Of Dsh Among Chinese Hdps Receiving Detoxification Treatment. Nevertheless, The Self-Harmers Of Chinese Hdps Are More Likely To Harm Themselves In A Dangerous Or Life-Threatening Way. Restricting The Availability Of Dsh Methods May Be An Effective Way To Prevent Or Reduce Dsh In China'S Detoxification Treatment Settings. © 2018 Zhong, Xu, Xie, Chen And Lu.",,False,,False,

Current Literature Lacks Good  Data Documenting Long-Term Outcomes In Children. This Makes It Difficult To  Counsel Some Patients About Realistic Treatment Expectations. The Objective Of  This Study Is To Evaluate Our Institutional Experience And Define The Natural  History And Treatment Outcomes. Methods: A Retrospective Review Of Clinical Data  Obtained From Children Who Underwent Dilation For Ps Was Performed. Results: Over  The Past 30 Years, 114 Children And Adolescents Received 486 Dilations. The Most  Common Indications For Stricture Dilation Were Ps (42%) And Esophageal Atresia  (38%). Other Lesser Indications Included Congenital, Foreign Body, Corrosive,  Cancer, Radiation, Allergic, And Infectious. This Review Focuses On The 48  Children With Ps. Of The Children With Ps, A Congenital Anomaly Was Identified In  23 Children; And 12 Had Neurologic Impairment. Average Age At Presentation Was  10.2 Years (Range, 0.5-18.3 Years). Most Patients Had Had Symptoms For Many  Months Before Diagnosis. Peptic Stricture Was Most Common In The Lower Esophagus  (N = 39). However, Middle (N = 8) And Upper (N = 1) Strictures Were Occasionally  Identified. Noncompliance With Medical Therapy Was A Challenge In 12% (N = 5) Of  Children. Children With A Ps Received A Median Of 3 Dilations, But A Subset Of 5  Patients With Severe Strictures Underwent Up To 48 Dilations (Range, 1-48).  Repeated Dilations Were Required For A Median Of 20 Months (Range, 1-242 Months).  Among Patients Receiving Esophageal Dilation For Ps, 94% Required An Antireflux  Procedure (19% Required A Second Antireflux Surgery). A Subgroup Of Patients (N =  10) Was Identified Who Required Extended Dilations, Multiple Surgeries, And  Esophageal Resection. This Subgroup Had A Significantly Longer Period Of  Symptomatic Disease And Increased Risk Of Esophageal Resection Compared With  Those Patients Requiring Fewer Dilations. Surgical Resection Of The Esophageal  Stricture Was Ultimately Required In 3 Children With Ps After Failure Of More  Conservative Measures. Conclusion: Children And Adolescents Presenting With  Reflux Esophageal Stricture (Ps) Frequently Require Antireflux Surgery, Redo  Antireflux Surgery, And Multiple Dilations For Recurrent Symptoms.

The Presentation Of Hnc Can Vary Between Developing And Developed Countries Due To Socioeconomic Factors. The Current Study Aimed To Profile The Swallowing Function Of Hnc Patients Before Starting Radiation Therapy In A Tertiary Hospital In India. Method: This Cross-Sectional Observational Study Examined Patients With Hnc Who Were Scheduled For Radiation Therapy. The Functional Oral Intake Scale (Fois) And Karnofsky Performance Status Scale Were Used To Assess The Patients’ Swallowing Status And Functional Abilities, Respectively. The Study Also Evaluated The Relationship Between Swallowing Function And Clinical-Demographic Factors. Results: Our Assessment Of 162 Hnc Patients Found That The Cancer Site Significantly Affects Swallowing. Although 92% Of Patients Had An Oral Diet, 64% Made Dietary Modifications. Patients With Non-Oral Intake Had Either Oral Or Pharyngeal Cancer, And Over 80% Of Oral Cancer Patients And 60% Of Those With Pharyngeal Cancer Had Already Made Changes To Their Diet. Patients With Laryngeal Cancer Had A Better Oral Intake, With 58% Reporting No Swallowing Issues. Conclusion: Patients With Hnc Scheduled For Radiation Therapy May Experience Varying Degrees Of Swallowing Difficulty. Early Intervention And Teaching Of Safe Swallowing Strategies Are Crucial To Prepare For The Potential Worsening Of Swallowing Difficulties Resulting From The Treatment. Advanced Tumor Stages And Oral/Pharyngeal Cancers Increase The Risk Of Significant Swallowing Issues.",,True,2.0,True,2.0

Patients And Methods: As Part Of A Larger Study Of  The Effects Of Retained Lead Bullets On Blood Lead, A Retrospective Review Of  Study Findings Was Completed On 5 Of 8 Patients Who Sustained Injuries To The  Maxillofacial Region. These 5 Patients Were Recruited Into The Larger Study  Within 11 Days Of Injury And Showed A Penetration Path For The Projectile That  Engaged The Upper Aerodigestive Tract. All Subjects Were Recruited From Patients  Presenting For Care Of Their Gunshot Injuries To A Large Inner-City Trauma Center  With A Retained Bullet Resulting From A Gunshot Injury. An Initial Blood Lead  Level Was Measured For All Recruited Patients And Repeated 1 To 17 Weeks Later.  Medical History Was Taken Along With A Screening And Risk Factor Questionnaire To  Determine Other Potential Or Actual Sources (Occupational/Recreational) Of Lead  Exposure. (109)Cd K-Shell X-Ray Fluorescence Determinations Of Bone Lead Were  Completed To Determine Past Lead Exposure Not Revealed By Medical History And  Risk Factor Questionnaire. Radiographs Taken Of The Abdomen And Chest, Required  As A Part Of The Patient'S Hospital Care, Were Retrospectively Reviewed For Signs  Of Metallic Fragments Along The Aerodigestive Tract. Results: All 5 Patients  Retained Multiple Lead Pellets Or Fragments At The Site Of Injury, Sustained  Fractures Of The Facial Bones, And Showed Increases In Blood Lead. Three Of The 5  Study Subjects Who Sustained Maxillofacial Gunshot Injuries Involving The Mouth,  Nose, Or Throat Region Showed Metallic Densities Along The Gastrointestinal Tract  Indicative Of Ingested Bullet Fragments. Each Patient With Ingested Bullet  Fragments Showed Rapid Elevation Of Blood Lead Exceeding 25 Microg/Dl And  Sustained Increases Well Beyond The Time When All Ingested Fragments Were  Eliminated. A 3-Year Follow-Up On These 3 Patients Showed Significantly Sustained  Elevation Of Blood Lead But Less Than That Observed During The Initial 6 Months  After Injury. None Of The 5 Study Subjects Showed Any Evidence Of Metallic  Foreign Bodies Within The Tracheobronchial Regions Indicative Of Aspiration.  Conclusion: Ingestion Of Lead Fragments Can Result From Gunshot Injuries To The  Maxillofacial Region And May Substantially Contribute To A Rapid Increase In  Blood Lead Level. Prompt Diagnosis And Elimination Of Ingested Lead Fragments Are  Essential Steps Necessary To Prevent Lead Being Absorbed From The  Gastrointestinal Tract. Increased Blood Lead In Victims After Gunshot Injuries  Must Be Fully Evaluated For All Potential Sources, Including Recent Environmental  Exposure, Absorption Of Lead From Any Remaining Bullets In Body Tissues, And The  Possibility Of Mobilization Of Lead From Long-Term Body Stores Such As Bone.",,True,2.0,True,2.0

Treatments Include Supportive Therapy, Antidotes (When Available) And Decontamination Techniques With The Aim Of Reducing Drugs Absorption By The Gastrointestinal System To Minimize Toxicity. Nevertheless, The Decontamination Techniques Currently Used, Such As Gastric Lavage (Gl), Activated Charcoal Or Whole-Bowel Irrigation, Have A Questionable Effectiveness. Endoscopic Gastric Decontamination (Egd) Treatment For Massive Ingestion Of Drugs Or Formation Of Pharmacobezoars Is Currently Described Only In Anecdotal Cases. Here We Describe The Management Of An Intentional Drug Overdose In An Adolescent Patient Treated With Egd And The Effects Of This Therapy On Drugs Pharmacokinetics. Case Report: A 15-Year-Old Boy Was Admitted In An Unconscious State (Glasgow Coma Scale: 7–8) To The Pediatric Intensive Care Unit After Assuming An Unspecified Amount Of Quetiapine, Aspirin, Bisoprolol, Fluoxetine, Furosemide, Alprazolam, And Pregabalin Pills. Rapid Sequence Intubation Was Immediately Performed And Then The Patient Was Treated With Symptomatic Therapy And Gl With Minimal Removal Of Gastric Material. Accounting For The Type Of Drugs, The Time Elapsed From Oral Assumption And The Unknown Quantity Assumed, Egd Was Attempted With Aim Of Removing Potential Aggregate Of The Drugs. Serial Blood Samples Were Taken Before And After Egd To Measure The Plasma Level Of The Drugs. A Pharmacobezoar Was Found And Was Immediately Removed With Egd. The Results Of The Drug Monitoring Showed That Quetiapine Exceeded The Toxic Level Reported In Literature Indicating That It May Have Been The Drug Assumed In Higher Quantity By Our Patient. Picu Stay Was Uneventful, And The Patient Was Transferred To The Psychiatric Ward After Extubation. Discussion: Our Case Shows How Gl Is Not Effective In Mitigating Multidrug Absorption Especially Drugs Potentially Inducing Pharmacobezoars.
