\subsection{Search Strategy}
Relevant articles were identified through a systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, PsycINFO, CENTRAL and Google Scholar on 15th January 2025, with the assistance of a librarian. 

The search was conducted using keywords and MeSH terms based on the concepts underpinning this review. The bibliography of each included article was searched for any further relevant articles. The keywords and MeSH terms used can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix:search-strategy}.

\subsection{Eligibility Criteria}
We included original studies involving humans of any age group who had intentionally ingested a foreign object through the oral cavity (mouth). Studies were excluded if the ingestion was not explicitly documented as intentional or if empirical data on individual intentional ingestions were unavailable.

Motivations or reasons for ingestion considered included protest, suicidal intent, self-harm, psychiatric conditions, and other documented motivations. Intervention details assessed included the number of ingestions and the management strategies employed (conservative, endoscopic, surgical). Object characteristics evaluated encompassed the ingestion of multiple, blunt, sharp-pointed, long (\(>5\text{ cm}\)), and short (\(<5\text{ cm}\))
