\subsection{Objectives}
This systematic review aims to achieve the following objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Quantify the rates} of endoscopic and surgical interventions following intentional ingestion of foreign objects in human populations.
  \item \textbf{Examine the influence of individual factors}—including demographics and motivations such as protest, self-harm, or suicidal intent—on the likelihood of requiring invasive intervention.
  \item \textbf{Assess the relationship between object type and clinical outcomes}, including rates of endoscopic and surgical procedures, as well as associated complications.
\end{enumerate}
