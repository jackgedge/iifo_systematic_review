\subsection*{Selection Process}

All identified articles were collated, duplicate articles were identified and removed. Following duplicate removal, all remaining articles underwent independent title and abstract screening conducted by the first author (JGE). To ensure consistency, a randomly selected 10\% sample of these articles underwent independent screening by a second author (MS) during both stages. Any discrepancies identified between these two reviewers were resolved by a third reviewer (GC). Inter-reviewer agreement was calculated at each screening stage.
